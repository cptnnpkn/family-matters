### Character Description
Dark Brown boots with light brown fur on top. Light brown pants and a bash shirt. A dark Brown hide armor vest with a short sleave on the left side with a Forest Green Vest Cloak. Two dark brown bracers one on each arm and a green quiver with Dark brown straps filled with Arrows on my back. At his waist you see some interesting hilts of swords. They are black with brown straps on the hilt and a beast’s head at the end. You also see that there is no traditional cross guard, it is more of a slant to one side. Brown eyes tanned skinned, a gymnast bod with a Goatee and moustache. Short hair on the side and a little bit longer on top.

At Home Father wanted me to learn whatever I wanted as a child, but I just hid from my father when it came to be with my tutors. The tutors knew where I was when I ditched lessons, but they did not tell my location to my father. I was always playing outside on the grounds just wanted to be free. The only lessons that I truly went to were combat basics and how to be a noble when I started to come of age. I still ditch lessons to feel free from it all. Then one day in my early 20’s my adoptive Father and I had a heated argument. I grabbed my stuff and I left. I come back once every few months to check on and help my siblings with their training and to see if they are all right.

When I was 27, I got jumped when I was in the woods. Some slavers wanted to catch me, but I gave them a slip. I slowly followed them back to their camp where they had a cart full of people. When it was late afternoon, I snuck into the camp and freed them and took out as many of the bastards as I could. I was really injured to the point of death. I manage to get away from the remainder of the slavers and came up to some old ruins. There bleeding out a group of rangers saved me. They were a secret order who collect and guard draconic lore which was very fascinating. I asked them if they can train me in their ways. I was training with them for a year. In that time, I never went back home. On my last trail they took me to their dragon leader. When I passed the trail, the dragon gave me a geode to care for.

I left with an oath that I will not speak of them or their location and that I am now a protector of the natural world.  After a while I started to have vivid dreams of a mysterious figure accompanied by seven yellow canaries, who warned me of some impending doom. When I awoke the geode creaked open and a drake was there waiting with me.

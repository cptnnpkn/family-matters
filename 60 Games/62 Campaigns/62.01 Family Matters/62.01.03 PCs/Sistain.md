# [[Sistain]]

Child of [[Merrick Joiner]]
Sibling of [[Vil'gar]] and [[Ar-aw-ka]]

Sistain was adopted by his father at an early age. He was drawn to the library at his father's home and spent many hours each day reading anything that peaked his interest. His father encouraged the intellectual exploration. When Sistain started exploring the arcane arts, his father cautioned him to be careful with the darker side of such knowledge. 

Sistain was rather indiscriminate in his reading and tends to take anything in print at face value, often with hilarious misunderstandings and gaps in real knowledge. 

A few years passed and Sistain gained some skill as a wizard but also loved to practice with some of the weaponry around his father's house. He settled on the rapier since he loved to jump in-and-out of close combat. 

He looked up to his older brothers but was also a bit reclusive so his brothers are not quite as tight with Sistain.

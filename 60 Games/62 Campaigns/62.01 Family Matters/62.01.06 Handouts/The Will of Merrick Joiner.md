# [[The Will of Merrick Joiner]]

I, [[60 Games/62 Campaigns/62.01 Family Matters/62.01.04 NPCs/Merrick Joiner]], being of sound mind and disposing memory, hereby declare this document to be my last will and testament. I have carefully considered my wishes regarding the distribution of my estate and the disposition of certain personal belongings. It is my sincere desire that my children honor and respect these instructions.

1. Executor and Distribution of Estate: I appoint [[Bram Godfrey]] as the executor of my estate. It is their responsibility to ensure that my assets are distributed according to the instructions outlined in this will. In the event that [[Bram Godfrey]] is unable or unwilling to act as executor, the role shall pass to the oldest child who is capable and willing to fulfill the duties.
    
2. Disposition of My Sword: I bequeath my beloved sword to my children collectively. However, I task them with a specific request that requires their united effort. It is my wish that my children destroy the sword and dispose of it responsibly.
    
3.  Process of Destruction: To carry out this task, I request that my children gather together and perform the following steps in unison:
    
    a) Hold a family meeting to discuss the importance of this act and its symbolic meaning. Understand that this act does not signify a lack of respect for my memory or the significance of the sword itself, but rather a desire for unity and peace among you.
    
    b) Safely dismantle the sword by separating the blade from the hilt. Take care to protect yourselves from any harm during this process.
    
    c) Melt down the blade and hilt into a form that is unrecognizable as a weapon. This can be accomplished through professional services or by any other means that ensures the sword's permanent transformation.
    
    d) Dispose of the transformed sword in a responsible manner. You may choose to bury it in a place that holds significance for our family, or to surrender it to a local authority for proper disposal.
    
4.  Distribution of Remaining Estate: Once the task of destroying the sword is completed, the remainder of my estate shall be distributed equally among my children. This includes all monetary assets, real estate, personal belongings, and any other items of value.
    
5.  Contingency Clause: In the event that any of my children contest or refuse to fulfill the task of destroying the sword, their portion of the estate shall be divided equally among the other siblings who have carried out their duty.
    
6.  Legal Assistance: I encourage my children to seek legal advice and guidance during the process of executing this will to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

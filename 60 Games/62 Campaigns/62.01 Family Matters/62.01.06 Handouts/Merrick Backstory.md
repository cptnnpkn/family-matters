# [[Merrick Backstory]]
![[Merrick Joiner.png]]

Once a fierce warrior, Merrick had seen countless battles, wars, and conflicts. He had fought with valor and bravery, always putting his life on the line for his kingdom and people. He had become a respected and feared fighter, renowned for his skill with a sword and his unwavering loyalty to his country.

But all that changed one day when he was injured during a battle. He was struck down by an enemy blade, and his injuries were so severe that he could no longer fight on the front lines. His days as a warrior were over, and he was forced to retire.

At first, he was despondent. He had dedicated his life to serving, and now he felt like he had lost his purpose. But then he realized that he could still serve in a different way - by training the next generation of soldiers.

Merrick opened his home, teaching young recruits how to fight, how to strategize, and how to survive in the harsh world of war. He drew upon his years of experience as a warrior, imparting his knowledge and wisdom to the new soldiers.

At first, he was reluctant to take on this new role. He missed the thrill of battle and the camaraderie of his fellow soldiers. But as he began to work with the recruits, he realized that he had found a new purpose in life. He was no longer just fighting for himself; he was fighting to ensure that this land would always have a strong and capable army.

Over time, Merrick became respected and beloved. His students looked up to him as a mentor and a role model, and he took pride in their accomplishments. Though he may have been forced to retire as a warrior, he found a new way to serve, and he knew that he would continue to do so until the end of his days.

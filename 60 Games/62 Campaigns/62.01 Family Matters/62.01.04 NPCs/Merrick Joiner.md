### [[Merrick Backstory]]
![[Merrick Joiner.png]]

Once a fierce warrior, Merrick had seen countless battles, wars, and conflicts. He had fought with valor and bravery, always putting his life on the line for his kingdom and people. He had become a respected and feared fighter, renowned for his skill with a sword and his unwavering loyalty to his country.

But all that changed one day when he was injured during a battle. He was struck down by an enemy blade, and his injuries were so severe that he could no longer fight on the front lines. His days as a warrior were over, and he was forced to retire.

At first, he was despondent. He had dedicated his life to serving, and now he felt like he had lost his purpose. But then he realized that he could still serve in a different way - by training the next generation of soldiers.

Merrick opened his home, teaching young recruits how to fight, how to strategize, and how to survive in the harsh world of war. He drew upon his years of experience as a warrior, imparting his knowledge and wisdom to the new soldiers.

At first, he was reluctant to take on this new role. He missed the thrill of battle and the camaraderie of his fellow soldiers. But as he began to work with the recruits, he realized that he had found a new purpose in life. He was no longer just fighting for himself; he was fighting to ensure that this land would always have a strong and capable army.

Over time, Merrick became respected and beloved. His students looked up to him as a mentor and a role model, and he took pride in their accomplishments. Though he may have been forced to retire as a warrior, he found a new way to serve, and he knew that he would continue to do so until the end of his days. 

Currently resides at the [[60 Games/62 Campaigns/62.01 Family Matters/62.01.05 Locations/Joiner Estate]].


###### Letter to the children

19 Mirtul, 1509

Dear Recipient,

I am deeply sorry to inform you of the passing of your father. It is with great sadness that I must inform you that he passed away in his sleep last night. We will be having a memorial service and reading of his will in coming days and need to prepare the compound. Please use the enclosed teleportation disc to be transported home immediately. All questions will be answered once all of the siblings have returned to the compound.

Sincerely,
Bram

###### Bram's Eulogy

Dear friends and colleagues,

Today, we gather to honor the life and legacy of a remarkable man, who was not only a devoted father but also a respected leader. He was a man of integrity, courage, and dedication, who served this land with honor and distinction.

Throughout his career, he demonstrated his exceptional leadership skills and unwavering commitment to excellence. He led by example and inspired those around him to be their best. He was a man of action, who never shied away from a challenge, and always took responsibility for his actions.

He was a trusted mentor and friend to many, always willing to lend an ear, share his wisdom and offer his support. He had a way of making people feel heard and valued, and his words of encouragement and guidance will be deeply missed.

As we bid farewell to this great man today, let us remember the impact he had on our lives and the world around us. Let us continue to carry his legacy forward by embodying the values he stood for, and by striving to be the best version of ourselves, just as he did.

Rest in peace, dear friend. You will be deeply missed, but your memory will live on in our hearts forever.

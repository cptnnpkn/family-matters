# Synaptic Static
*5th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes `8d6` psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a `d6` and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration). The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)

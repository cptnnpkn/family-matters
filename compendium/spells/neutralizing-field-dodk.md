You negate contaminated magical energies in a 10-foot radius sphere. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centred on you. Creatures in the sphere (including you) can't gain contamination levels and have immunity to necrotic damage. Contaminated spells can't be cast by creatures in the area.

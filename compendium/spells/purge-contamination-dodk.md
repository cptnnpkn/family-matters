# Purge Contamination
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, 100 gp of alchemical fluids or holy water, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You apply alchemical fluids or holy water to a contaminated humanoid creature while reciting an exacting magical chant that expels eldritch contaminants from the target's body. When you finish casting the spell, all contamination levels and mutations are removed from the creature. It then gains one level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) for each contamination level removed with this spell.

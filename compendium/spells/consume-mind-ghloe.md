# Consume Mind
*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a 1-ounce fresh or magically preserved portion of another creature's brain
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You consume the brain of another creature's corpse, gaining its memories and knowledge. The corpse must have a brain and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse has been dead (and not preserved) for more than three days.

Until the spell ends, you can attempt to recall any important fact known to the creatureâ€”family history, recent events, building layouts, passwords, details of the creature's death, and similar information. To recall a piece of information, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting modifier. The DC is equal to the corpse's Intelligence score.

Once the caster rolls to determine whether they recall a fact, they cannot attempt to recall it again.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md), [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)

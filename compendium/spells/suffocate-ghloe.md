# Suffocate
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a leather glove
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a pair of grasping hands made from [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) forces. Make a spell attack against one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the creature is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) as the hands crush their throat or bodily equivalent.

If the creature requires air to breathe, it begins to suffocate. A suffocating creature can survive for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn after those rounds are over, it becomes [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious), and it can't regain hit points until it can breathe again.

A conscious creature [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the hands can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)

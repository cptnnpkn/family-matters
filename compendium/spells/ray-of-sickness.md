# Ray of Sickness
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `2d8` poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.

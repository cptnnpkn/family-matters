# Vitriolic Sphere
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a drop of giant slug bile
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `10d4` acid damage and another `5d4` acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by `2d4` for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)

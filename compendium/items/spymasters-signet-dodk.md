# Spymaster's Signet
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this ring, you can cast [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) at-will. In addition, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible for one minute, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again. Once you use this power, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Crown Authority

A character cannot attune to more than one Seal of Drakkenheim. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as [wall gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) and [tower dragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the Seals of Drakkenheim. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.

As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each [wall gargoyle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) or [tower dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.

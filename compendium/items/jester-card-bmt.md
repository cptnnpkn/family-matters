# Jester Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/decks/img/deck-of-many-things-14-jester.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Otto's Irresistible Dance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ottos-irresistible-dance.md) spell (save DC 17), and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

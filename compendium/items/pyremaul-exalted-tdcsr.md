# Pyremaul (Exalted)
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![A maul embedded with an or...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/pyremaul.webp#right "A maul embedded with an orange gemstone emitting flames from the head of the weapon.")  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed), [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

Forged from deep red iron, this massive hammer is set with a brilliant fire opal that shimmers with eternal flame. It is rumored to be currently wielded by "Grand Legate Phaestor, the fire giant ruler of Vulkanon", somewhere beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains".

## Dormant

While Pyremaul is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `1d6` fire damage.

Additionally, you can choose to have this weapon shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet (no action required).

## Awakened

When Pyremaul reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack rolls increases to +2.  
- The extra fire damage dealt by the weapon increases to `2d6`.  
- As an action, you can slam Pyremaul into the ground to cast the [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) spell at 2nd level (save DC 15). You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.  
- Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

## Exalted

When Pyremaul reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack rolls increases to +3.  
- The extra fire damage dealt by the weapon increases to `3d6`.  
- When you cast [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) with the weapon, you do so at 3rd level and the save DC increases to 17.  
- When you score a critical hit with this weapon, the saving throw to avoid being knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) increases to 17. You also roll an extra `3d6` fire damage when determining the extra damage for the critical hit.  
- When you kill a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can take `10d10` fire damage and immolate the creature's corpse. This damage can't be reduced in any way, and you die if this damage reduces you to 0 hit points. The immolated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of ash. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection.md) or a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. You can't use this property of the maul again until 7 days have passed.

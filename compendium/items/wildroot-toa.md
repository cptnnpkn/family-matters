# Wildroot
*Adventuring Gear, unknown*  

- **Cost**: 25 gp

Introducing the juice of a wildroot into a [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature's bloodstream (for example, by rubbing it on an open wound) rids the creature of the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition. Once used in this way, a wildroot loses this property.

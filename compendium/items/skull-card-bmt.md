# Skull Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/decks/img/deck-of-many-things-19-skull.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast [Spirit of Death](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spirit-of-death-bmt.md) (see "chapter 7") as a 6th-level spell (spell attack bonus `+9`, save DC 17). Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Forged with a mercurial metal accidentally drawn from the Realms Beyond, this dagger shimmers with an unsettling sourceless light. It was once wielded by [Vax'ildan, a legendary champion of the Matron of Ravens](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md). Two raven feathers are linked to its pommel as a memento of its former bearer.

You can use the grimoire as your spellbook, and you can scribe new spells into it as normal. When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire, the number of wizard spells you can prepare increases by 1.

## Awakened

When the Grimoire Infinitus reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- While you carry the spellbook, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.  
- When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire as your spellbook, the number of spells you can prepare increases by 1 again.

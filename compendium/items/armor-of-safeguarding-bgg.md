# Armor of Safeguarding
*Generic Variant, very rare (requires attunement)*  


Set in the center of this armor's chest is a citrine engraved with the shield rune.

While wearing this armor, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to 10 + your level.

## Invoking the Rune

As an action, you can invoke the armor's rune to cast the [beacon of hope](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/beacon-of-hope.md) spell with it; the spell has a duration of 1 minute and doesn't require [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration). Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

# Staff of Defense
*Melee Weapon, rare (requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

## Spells

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: [mage armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-armor.md) (1 charge) or [shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shield.md) (2 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.

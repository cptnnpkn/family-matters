# Bracer of Flying Daggers
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This armband appears to have thin [daggers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md) strapped to it. As an action, you can pull up to two magic daggers from the bracer and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you don't hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers.

# Medal of the Maze
*Wondrous Item, common*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/medal-of-the-maze.webp#right)  


When you use an action to trace the maze inscribed on this medal, you gain advantage on Wisdom checks and know the quickest route to the end of any nonmagical path or maze for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again, and the medal becomes nonmagical.

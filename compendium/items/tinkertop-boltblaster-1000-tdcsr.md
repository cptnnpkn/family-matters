# Tinkertop Boltblaster 1000
*Ranged Weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 P
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [Ammunition](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Ammunition), [Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Loading](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Loading), Martial

This strange contraption of gears, wires, and lacquered wood has a handle with a metal grip and crank. Its stock bears a flamboyant maker's mark that reads: "Made in Hupperdook," a city in "Wildemount". You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you can immediately make another attack with this weapon after resolving the critical hit. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take `1d6` piercing damage as some of its gears and wires spring loose.

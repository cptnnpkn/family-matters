# Inescapable Lash
*Melee Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Extended Reach](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Extended%20Reach), [Finesse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), Martial
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This braided cord is dull bronze in color, ends in a splayed set of three barbs, and gleams like metal under any light. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to [grapple](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) the target as a bonus action.

While you have a creature [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until you let go of the whip. A creature [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) in this way can escape by making a successful Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

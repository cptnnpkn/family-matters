# Honor's Last Stand (Exalted)
*Shield, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-evil alignment)*  
![A massive silver shield wi...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/honorslaststand.webp#right "A massive silver shield with the platinum dragon engraved on the front.")  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

> [!note] Rules Tip: Pushing and Shoving
> 
> Certain character options, such as the Path of the Juggernaut barbarian in "chapter 4", grant the ability to push other creatures around the battlefield with your attacks. But this is just one way to push a creature. If you want to move a creature without hurting it, there's a [special shove attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#shove) available to all characters. The "Vestige of Divergence" Honor's Last Stand encourages you to shove your foes away while you valiantly stand your ground.

This massive silvered shield bears the crest of The Platinum Dragon and never tarnishes. Its metal is always warm to the touch.

## Dormant

While Honor's Last Stand is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while holding the shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. You also can't be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) while bearing this shield.

## Awakened

When Honor's Last Stand reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The shield's bonus to AC increases to +2.  
- If you successfully [shove](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#shove) a creature while holding this shield, that creature takes `2d6` force damage.  
- When a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can attempt to [shove](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#shove) that creature as a reaction.  

## Exalted

When Honor's Last Stand reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

- The shield's bonus to AC increases to +3.  
- When you successfully [shove](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#shove) a creature while holding this shield, you can move it up to 15 feet away from you.  
- As a bonus action, you can protect an ally within 5 feet of you, granting that ally a +3 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until they are no longer within 5 feet of you.

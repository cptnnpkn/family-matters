# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-free-action.webp#right)  


While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) or [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).

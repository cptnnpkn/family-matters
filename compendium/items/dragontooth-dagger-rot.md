A dagger fashioned from the tooth of a dragon. While the blade is obviously a fang or predator's tooth, the handle is leather wrapped around the root of the tooth, and there is no crossguard.

## Draconic Potency

Against enemies of the Cult of the Dragon, the dagger's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to 2, and the extra acid damage increases to `2d6`.

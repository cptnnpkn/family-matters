# Windvane
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/windvane.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 P
  - Two-handed: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Thrown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md), the Prince of Evil Air.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra `1d6` lightning damage.

## Air Mastery

You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane:

- You can speak Auran fluently.  
- You have resistance to lightning damage.  
- You can cast [dominate monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster.md) (save DC 17) on an [air elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md). Once you have done so, Windvane can't be used this way again until the next dawn.  

## Song of the Four Winds

While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a [devastation orb of air](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/devastation-orb-of-air-pota.md). Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

## Flaw

Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me."

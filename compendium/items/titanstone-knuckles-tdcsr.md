- **Properties**: [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

Carved from the heartstone of a slain earth primordial, these gauntlets bestow immeasurable might to their wearer. In recent times, they were wielded by the legendary barbarian [Grog Strongjaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grog-strongjaw-tdcsr.md), who continues to use them as he seeks worthy challengers across Tal'Dorei and Exandria.

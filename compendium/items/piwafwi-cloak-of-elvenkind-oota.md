# Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/piwafwi-cloak-of-elvenkind.webp#right)  


This dark spider-silk cloak is made by [drow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md). It is a [cloak of elvenkind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cloak-of-elvenkind.md). It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

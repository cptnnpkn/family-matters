# Lock of Trickery
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  


This lock appears to be an ordinary lock (of the type described in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) and comes with a single key. The tumblers in this lock magically adjust to thwart burglars. Dexterity checks made to pick the lock have disadvantage.

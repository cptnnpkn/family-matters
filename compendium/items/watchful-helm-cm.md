# Watchful Helm
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear this helm, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and remain aware of your surroundings even while you're asleep, and you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

As a bonus action, you can cast the [see invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell from the helm. Once this property of the helm is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

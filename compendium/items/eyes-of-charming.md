# Eyes of Charming
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/eyes-of-charming.webp#right)  


These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md) spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

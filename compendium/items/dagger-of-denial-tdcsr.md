# Dagger of Denial
*Melee Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*  
![The Dagger of Denial: a lo...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/daggerofdenial.webp#right "The Dagger of Denial: a long, thin pointed silver dagger with an ivory coloured hilt crossing in front of an ivory sheath with a silver ends.")  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This silver stiletto blade bears intricate grooves that spiral from its tip to its ivory hilt and handle. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

As an action, you can place the point of the blade into any keyhole and seal it shut. A keyhole sealed in this way can't be unlocked until this dagger is placed into that keyhole once more (though a sealed door or container can still be broken, bypassing the lock). Sealing a keyhole unseals any keyholes previously sealed with this weapon.

# Scorpion Armor
*Heavy Armor, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This suit of plate armor is fashioned from [giant scorpion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md) chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).  
- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.  
- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).  

## Curse

This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (`10d10 + 45`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell can remove the armor's curse.

# Slumbering Dragon Vessel
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md), or a [potion of climbing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-climbing.md). Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.

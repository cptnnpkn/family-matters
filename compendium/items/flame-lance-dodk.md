# Flame Lance
*Melee Weapon, uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 1d12 P
- **Properties**: Martial, [Reach](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Special](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Special)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This weapon is a long metal lance with a small flame that burns at its end. It has a hose coming from the hilt that connects to a metal tank that you wear on your back.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

The tank has 5 charges. You can use an action and expend one or more charges from the tank to cast [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) (Save DC 15). For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

Once per day, you can pour a vial of alchemist's fire into the tank. When you do, it regains all expended charges. It otherwise does not regain charges on its own.

You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

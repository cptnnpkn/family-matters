^deck-of-miscellany

The face of each card bears an illustration of a different item or set of items. As an action, you can draw a card of your choice from the deck and throw it to the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself. When the card hits the ground, the card permanently transforms into the item or set of items depicted on its face. An altered deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck, as shown on the Deck of Miscellany table.

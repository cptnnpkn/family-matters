- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: Martial, [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Utilized in countless tortures and slow executions, the hooked chains of this brutal weapon constantly show dried blood and rot. Legend says that Agony was wielded in the "Calamity" by the gnoll scion of a flesh-eating Demon Lord.

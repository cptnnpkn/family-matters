# Mind Crystal (Subtle)
*Wondrous Item, common*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/mind-crystal.webp#right)  


This gemstone contains a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding the mind crystal, you can modify the spell in the way described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can't use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use the mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

## Modify Spell

You cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components for this casting.

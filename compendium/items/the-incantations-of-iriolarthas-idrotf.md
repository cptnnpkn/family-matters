# The Incantations of Iriolarthas
*Adventuring Gear, unknown*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/the-incantations-of-iriolarthas.webp#right)  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The Incantations of Iriolarthas is a weighty spellbook. Its black leather covers have dead, toothy worms glued to them, sheathed in glossy varnish. Set into this morbid display on the front cover is a gold rune that resembles a stylized eye with a pupil shaped like a candle flameâ€”the sigil of Iriolarthas, a Netherese lich.

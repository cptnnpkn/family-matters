# Circlet of Barbed Vision
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-good alignment)*  
![A mystical dark blue cloak...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/circletofbarbedvision.webp#right "A mystical dark blue cloak with metallic, flowing embroidered designs.")  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

When you don this circlet of gnarled onyx, black barbs dig into your head, imparting power to you as the circlet twists your appearance to amuse the The Spider Queen. The current resting place of the Circlet of Barbed Vision is unknown, but rumor has it that a spectral assassin known as [the Inevitable End](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jourrael-the-caedogeist-tdcsr.md) seeks this relic.

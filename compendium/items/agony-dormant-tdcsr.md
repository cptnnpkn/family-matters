# Agony (Dormant)
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-good alignment)*  
![A spiked three-headed flai...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/agony.webp#right "A spiked three-headed flail with four meat hooks attached by chains.")  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: Martial, [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Utilized in countless tortures and slow executions, the hooked chains of this brutal weapon constantly show dried blood and rot. Legend says that Agony was wielded in the "Calamity" by the gnoll scion of a flesh-eating Demon Lord.

## Dormant

While Agony is in a dormant state, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you damage a creature with Agony, that creature is marked for 10 minutes or until you damage a different creature. When you hit a creature marked in this way with this weapon, the target takes an extra `1d6` piercing damage.

# Steward's Seal
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this badge, you can cast [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md), [purify food and drink](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md), and [unseen servant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/unseen-servant.md) at-will.

You can use an action to cast one of the following spells: [animate objects](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animate-objects.md), [create food and water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md), [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), or [telekinesis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md). Once the badge has been used to cast one of these spells, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. You can choose your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score as the spellcasting ability for casting these spells, and use your proficiency bonus to determine their attack bonus and saving throw DC.

## Crown Authority

A character cannot attune to more than one Seal of Drakkenheim. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as [wall gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) and [tower dragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the Seals of Drakkenheim. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.

As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each [wall gargoyle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) or [tower dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.

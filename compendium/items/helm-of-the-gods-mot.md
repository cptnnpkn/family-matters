# Helm of the Gods
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this helm, you know whether there is a celestial or fiend within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located, provided the creature isn't behind total cover.

Whenever you finish a long rest while wearing the helm, you can pray to one of the gods listed on the Helm of the Gods table and store the listed spell in the helm, replacing any spell that is already stored there. The save DC for the spell is 13.

The helm has 3 charges. To cast a spell from the helm, you must expend 1 charge, and the helm regains `1d3` charges daily at dawn.

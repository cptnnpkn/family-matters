# Sun Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/decks/img/deck-of-many-things-10-sun.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Sunbeam](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sunbeam.md) spell (save DC 17), projecting the light from the card's face. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

# Kiss of the Changebringer (Dormant)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![An intricate silver necklace with emerald gems.](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/kissofthechangebringer.webp#right)  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

A beautiful, glittering emerald is set within this silver chain, humming with power and possibility. It is said that this amulet was stolen from the neck of The Changebringer herself by the The Lord of the Hells, and locked within the vaults of Bazzoxan in "Wildemount". It was later claimed there by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers during an expedition into that grim fortress's abandoned temples.

## Dormant

While the Kiss of the Changebringer is in a dormant state, you have a +1 bonus to saving throws and are immune to the [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition while wearing it.

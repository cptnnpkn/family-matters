# Winter's Dark Bite
*Melee Weapon, uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This greatsword is made of an unknown black metal. In most cases, it works as a [+1 greatsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md). But when used against a [thessalhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/thessalhydra-hftt.md), it works as a [+3 greatsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/3-weapon.md). While in the Upside Down, it works as a +4 greatsword.

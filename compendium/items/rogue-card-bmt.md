# Rogue Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/decks/img/deck-of-many-things-06-rogue.webp#right)  


When you hit a target with a weapon attack while holding this card, you can deal an extra `6d6` force damage to that target. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

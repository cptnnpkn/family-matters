# Dawnbringer
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-evil alignment)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/dawnbringer.webp#right)  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 R
  - Two-handed: 1d10 R
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), Martial, [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

Lost for ages in the Underdark, Dawnbringer appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with [shortswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md) or [longswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md), you are proficient with Dawnbringer.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra `1d8` radiant damage.

The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast [lesser restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Sentience

Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while attuned to it.

## Personality

Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.

Long years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.

# Ruin Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/decks/img/deck-of-many-things-16-ruin.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Disintegrate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disintegrate.md) spell (save DC 17). Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

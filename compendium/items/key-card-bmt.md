# Key Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/decks/img/deck-of-many-things-02-key.webp#right)  


As an action, you can brandish this card and use it to cast the [Knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell, with no sound made by the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all expended uses at dawn.

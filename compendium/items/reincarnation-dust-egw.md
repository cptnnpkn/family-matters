# Reincarnation Dust
*Wondrous Item, very rare*  


When this small pouch of purple dust is sprinkled on a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid, the dust is absorbed by the remains. If willing, the dead creature returns to life with a new body as if the [reincarnate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/reincarnate.md) spell had been cast on the remains.

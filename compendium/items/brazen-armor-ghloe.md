*Heavy Armor, very rare (requires attunement)*

- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

This armor, fashioned from the body of an [Empyrean brazen bull](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/empyrean-brazen-bull-ghloe.md), gleams brightly in direct sunlight. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, you have resistance to fire and radiant damage.

Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

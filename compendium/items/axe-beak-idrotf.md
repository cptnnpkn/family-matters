# Axe Beak
*Mount*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/axe-beak.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: 50 gp

An [axe beak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/axe-beak.md)'s splayed toes allow it to run across snow, and it can carry as much weight as a mule. A domesticated axe beak can be purchased in Ten-Towns for 50 gp.

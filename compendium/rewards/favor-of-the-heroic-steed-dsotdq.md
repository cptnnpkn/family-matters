# Favor of the Heroic Steed
*Charm*  

Two heroic steeds find you worthy and agree to serve you. This charm has 2 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to summon a [warhorse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) wearing plate barding (AC 18). The warhorse serves you for 24 hours, then vanishes.

# Karametra's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Karametra trait*

You can cast [create food and water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md) with this trait. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).

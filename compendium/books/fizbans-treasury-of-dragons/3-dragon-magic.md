# Dragon Magic
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons, p. 19* 

The magic woven through the fabric of the Material Plane is concentrated in dragons and their lairs. This chapter is all about the magic of dragons, unfolding in four sections:

""Spells"" offers a selection of spells associated with dragons.

""Magic Items"" presents several magic items associated with dragons, many connected to the gem dragons introduced in "chapter 6".

""Hoard Items"" introduces a new kind of magic items, which siphon the magical energy associated with a dragon's hoard.

""Draconic Gifts"" introduces magical gifts that characters might gain in connection with a dragon's death or other unusual circumstances.

## Spells

This section contains new spells that the DM may add to a campaign, making them available to player characters and monster spellcasters alike. The Spells table lists the new spells, ordering them by level. The table also notes the school of magic of a spell, whether it requires concentration, whether it bears the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it.

## Hoard Magic Items

Certain magic items can absorb the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard. The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states, which are summarized on the Hoard Item States table. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant state.

![Hoard Magic Items; Hoard Item States](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/hoard-magic-items-hoard-item-states-ftd.md)

### Increasing Power

A hoard item left to steep in a dragon's hoard absorbs power from the hoard. Older dragons' hoards are charged with more magic and can empower hoard items to higher states.

Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon, as shown on the Hoard Item States table. For example, a hoard item that steeps in a young dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Stirring state, while one that steeps in an ancient dragon's hoard for 1 year reaches the pinnacle of its power and enters its Ascendant state. If there are one or more hoard items steeping in a dragon's hoard, the dragon is aware of them. The dragon also knows what these hoard items are and what state (Slumbering, Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant) each of them is in.

When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state (from Slumbering to Stirring, Stirring to Wakened, or Wakened to Ascendant), as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's ageâ€”putting a Wakened item in a slain adult dragon's hoard does not make it Ascendant, for example.

### Decreasing Power

Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering.

### Hoard Item Quirks

Hoard items often manifest strange qualities beyond their intended function, regardless of the state they're in. Roll once on the Draconic Quirks table to determine the quirk of a hoard item.

Hoard items are presented here in alphabetical order. A hoard item's rarity changes depending on its current state, as shown in each item description.

## Draconic Gifts

As described in "chapter 3", the death of a dragon can result in its power taking root in a character, whether that person is the dragon's chosen heir or the dragon's killer. The result of this investiture can vary widely in power and impact, from a minor charm to a complete transformation.

Sometimes, a draconic gift has an obvious visual manifestation, such as when a character is transformed into a dragonborn. Other gifts are invisible, but no less potent. But on some worlds, the investiture of draconic power is accompanied by some kind of physical manifestation, especially if it's derived from slaying a dragon. It might be small and easily hidden, but those who know to look can usually identify a dragonslayer (or another character who carries a draconic gift) by a telltale sign. The Draconic Marks table suggests some possibilities of what these marks might look like.

### Draconic Gift Descriptions

> [!quote]- A quote from Fizban

> Some of the less common draconic gifts I've seen bestowed include chubby cheeks and an adorable nature; the ability to blow immaculate smoke rings; and the innate sense of when your egg is perfectly soft-boiled. I wouldn't mind that last one myself.

The draconic gifts detailed in this section have rarities like magic items. The rarity of a draconic gift corresponds roughly to the age category of the dragon that bestowed it, as shown in the Draconic Gift Rarity table.

You can use a more common draconic gift for an older dragon, but exercise caution going in the other direction. Very rare and legendary draconic gifts can unbalance the game if they're given to low-level characters.

> [!note] Feats as Draconic Gifts
> 
> If your campaign uses the optional feat rules from the "Player's Handbook", your Dungeon Master might give you a feat as a variant draconic gift. You gain one feat of your or the DM's choice, which is related in some way to the draconic power you have acquired. Consider these examples:
> 
> - Your heightened senses give you a dragon's awareness of your surroundings ([Alert](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/alert.md) or [Observant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/observant.md)).  
> - Dragon's blood has made you hardy and resilient ([Durable](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/durable.md), [Resilient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/resilient.md), or [Tough](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/tough.md)).  
> - Exposure to the primal energy of a dragon's body has given you a magical affinity for one damage type ([Elemental Adept](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/elemental-adept.md)).  
> - You are infused with a dragon's charismatic gift for inspiration ([Inspiring Leader](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/inspiring-leader.md)).  
> - You are imbued with a dragon's intellect ([Keen Mind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/keen-mind.md)).  
> - The dragon's gift lingers in the form of good luck ([Lucky](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/lucky.md)).  
> - The dragon's inherent magic has transferred to your own blood ([Magic Initiate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/magic-initiate.md)).  
> 
> At the DM's discretion, you might also be able to gain one of the draconic feats described in "chapter 1" as a draconic gift.

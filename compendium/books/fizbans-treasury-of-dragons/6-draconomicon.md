## Using the Entries

For each dragon's entry in this chapter, you'll find information about crafting personalities, inspiration for building adventures, details about lairs, and ideas about the kinds of treasures that dragon favors. Scattered throughout are maps of dragon lairs you can plunder for your adventures.

### Creating a Dragon

Use the tables in this section in conjunction with ""Roleplaying Dragons"" in "chapter 3" to craft distinctive dragon characters. Most of the personality traits and ideals align with the general nature of the dragons, but the tables also include examples of atypical dragons.

For dragons who do not have spellcasting ability, this section also includes suggested spells to give a dragon if you want it to be a spellcaster. A table shows the spells a typical dragon knows, along with the spell save DC for those spells. The dragon can cast each listed spell once per day, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

### Dragon Adventures

Building on ""Dragon Adventures"" in "chapter 3", this section starts with a collection of adventure hooks that might bring characters into contact with a dragon of a particular kind, whether in conflict or as an ally or patron. Then, additional tables explore the relationships each kind of dragon has to other creatures of a similar challenge rating in their preferred environment. Use these tables to inspire adventures that feature dragons dwelling alongside other creatures, either as enemies or as allies.

### Dragon Lairs

This section expands on ""Dragon Lairs"" in "chapter 4". If there is a map of a sample lair for a dragon of that kind, it is accompanied by discussion of the lair's important features. Many of these sections also describe additional lair actions a dragon can use to exploit the lair's features, as well as additional regional effects that might alter the landscape surrounding the lair.

You can adjust the scale on the lair maps to suit the needs of the dragon lairing there. If you use these maps for a wyrmling's lair, you might set the scale to 5 feet per square, but for an ancient dragon or a greatwyrm, you might need to go as high as 20 feet per square to give the dragon room to move.

### Dragon Treasures

Each entry ends with a discussion of the kinds of treasures the dragon favors, including a table of art objects you can use to expand on the information in ""What's in a Hoard?"" in "chapter 4". The items shown on these tables can represent art objects of any value, depending on their materials, quality, and history. For example, a small bronze bust might be worth 25 gp, while a large bust crafted from platinum and emeralds could be worth 7,500 gp.

### Dragons of Legend

Sidebars throughout this chapter highlight famous dragons of different kinds. Many of these legendary dragons are almost godlike in stature, known and respected on multiple worlds across the Material Plane.

## Amethyst Dragons

> [!quote]- A quote from Fizban  
> 
> I once sought life advice from an amethyst dragon who specialized in that sort of thing. I told her all my flaws and unwanted behaviors, and she prescribed the best elixir: "Stop doing those things!" I still think back on that visit in trying times.

Use the tables, map, and other information in this section to craft unique encounters with amethyst dragons. Amethyst dragon stat blocks appear in "chapter 6".

#### Connected Creatures

Amethyst dragons are generally aloof creatures, dwelling in isolation for long periods of time and rarely cultivating connections with other creatures. When they do connect with others, it is most often for intellectual and philosophical pursuits or to fulfill some arcane purpose involving the dragons' echoes across the worlds.

> [!note] Eldenser the Lurker
> 
> Contradictory tales told throughout the Forgotten Realms are unclear about whether or not the ancient amethyst dragon Eldenser still lives, largely because of the behavior that earned him the epithets "the Lurker" and "the Worm Who Hides in Blades." Obsessed with observing the world and its creatures, Eldenser developed magic that allows his mind to inhabit the blade of a weapon after his death. He exists now as a [draconic shard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/draconic-shard-ftd.md) (described in "chapter 6").
> 
> Eldenser prefers the role of silent observer to doing anything that might give away his presence. In this fashion, he has inhabited countless weapons over long years, including many belonging to famous adventurers whose exploits the dragon has seen firsthand.
^eldenser-the-lurker

### Amethyst Dragon Lairs

Amethyst dragons prefer lairs near water, ideally mountain lakes, where they take advantage of existing caves and tunnels. A lair behind a cascading waterfall is ideal, and often part of that lair is submerged, allowing the dragon to rest in the water and cultivate the fish that are their preferred food.

Amethyst dragon lairs frequently exhibit or develop large and beautiful clusters of amethyst crystals, including massive cathedral geodes split open to show their contents and clusters of crystal points more than a foot in diameter that extend six to ten feet from the interior stone surfaces of the lair. These crystals resonate with the dragon's presence, and glow with a soft inner light. The older the dragon, the deeper the purple color of the crystals.

#### Amethyst Dragon Lair Features

The amethyst dragon lair shown in map 5.1 is set beneath a mountain ridge between two deep tarns, with streams flowing down toward the lowlands. The lair has the following features:

- **Entrances.** Two cave entrances provide access to the lair, one in the rock face just above one tarn and one below the surface of the other tarn. The dragon uses the underwater passage as a secret entrance and emergency exit.  
- **Main Caves.** The lair is a complex of caves and tunnels; the stone surfaces are smooth and water-worn, and the air is cool and slightly damp.  
- **Glowing Crystals.** Large clusters of glowing amethyst crystals grow out from the walls and ceiling, casting dim light in a 30-foot radius.  
- **Chimneys.** Two chimneys connect the main caves to the three chambers above. Each chimney appears to continue up through the ceiling of the upper level and down through the floor of the lower level, but the dragon's magic warps space within the lair. Moving up past the upper level brings a creature to the lower level again, while moving down from the lower level brings a creature to the upper level. A creature or object dropped down one of the chimneys continues falling endlessly unless it or some outside force has the means to slow or stop it. This property of the lair vanishes after `1d10` days if the dragon dies.  
- **Upper Caves.** The dragon most often sleeps in the largest upper chamber of the lair. The dragon's hoard is divided between that area and the chamber at the opposite end of the upper level. The magic of the lair sometimes makes it appear as though the dragon were sleeping amid both caches, creating the impression that two dragons dwell here.  

### Amethyst Dragon Treasures

Amethyst dragons often collect crystals and gems, particularly their namesake stones, in raw, polished, or cut forms. They have less interest in coins and precious metals, although many have a fascination with metal items that have a silvery finish.

Amethyst dragons favor treasures with particular scholarly or philosophical value as a part of their hoard, including fine books, scrolls, or carved tablets; tapestries or woven "tomes" of embroidered cloth; complex scientific instruments; and religious icons or objects. They are fond of unique and unusual art objects, especially those connected to far-off or long-lost cultures, other planes of existence, or other worlds—and of magic items that allow movement between those planes or worlds. The odd spatial nature of an amethyst dragon's lair can sometimes cause items to transpose between one dragon's hoard and the hoards of the dragon's echoes, allowing for treasures with a surprising range of origins.

#### Connected Creatures

Black dragons prefer the company of creatures that are easy to control and present little threat of betrayal. Mindless Undead, shambling mounds, carnivorous flora, Oozes, and Constructs make appealing servants, especially working in concert with a black dragon's fiendishly clever traps. A black dragon's intelligent followers tend to worship draconic majesty and typically include kobolds, troglodytes, lizard folk, and (more rarely) yuan-ti.

### Black Dragon Lairs

Black dragons prefer to lair in swamps and jungles—the more dismal and fetid, the better. Within those environs, they favor ruins for their defensibility and dreary aesthetic.

When choosing their lairs, black dragons are fond of locations that are naturally constraining and confounding. Whether adventurers seeking the dragon must wind their way through the roots of an ancient mangrove swamp or brave a trap-filled boggy ruin, the experience promises to be a deadly affair.

#### Black Dragon Lair Features

The black dragon lair shown in map 5.2 is a derelict chapel, lost to time in a gloomy fen. The building's wooden framing rotted away long ago, leaving a looming skeleton of lichen-covered stone and a lone tower. The lair has the following features:

- **Swampy Lake.** Abutting the chapel is a swampy lake where the dragon sleeps. The foul water stinks of dead fish and rot, while the dense foliage and scraggly trees along the shoreline writhe with scuttling, slithering fauna. A thick blanket of fog—part of the dragon's corrupting influence—adds a claustrophobic feel to the lair.  
- **Chapel Floor.** Columns of clammy stone jut like ribs from the chapel's exposed floor, as if in mockery of the sanctity of this once-holy place.  
- **Underground.** Twin staircases in the main hall descend to a partially flooded crypt. Five trapped stone sarcophagi rise above the waterline, their lids depicting armored warriors whose faces have been scoured away by acid. Each sarcophagus holds a few coins and shiny baubles mixed with junk that appears to be treasure at first glance. In the tower basement, a fully submerged tunnel leads to the lake where the dragon sleeps.  
- **Chapel Tower.** A swollen oak door, flanked by worn carvings of noble warriors, opens into the dank stone tower, which stands empty except for a chipped staircase that climbs to a second floor and then ends in midair before reaching the crumbling third level. Mold-covered friezes of knights kneeling before angelic beings line the stairwell.  
- **Tower Top.** The dragon's true hoard is kept safely at the top of the crumbling tower, where the dragon enjoys perching and staring out into the gloom. Intruders who can't fly must scale the sheer, slimy walls of the tower (either from outside or from the interior of the second floor), braving whatever traps might be in store if they hope to claim the dragon's real treasures.

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md)) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Filth Burst.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is "difficult terrain".  
- **Grasping Muck.** Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Noxious Gas.** A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Ennui.** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.  
- **Grating Spies.** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.  
- **Rotting Domain.** Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.  

### Black Dragon Treasures

Black dragons appreciate objects of cultural, magical, or scientific significance that originated from lost cultures. Knowing a relic they possess is coveted by others because it presents a link to a lost past is what gives that relic its value. Black dragons also love conventional treasures such as gems (particularly opals), precious metals that don't corrode easily, and stone sculptures.

Because their lairs are inevitably slimy and dank, if not outright flooded, black dragons rarely have cloth, wood, or paper items unless such items are stored in watertight containers. Black dragons versed in magic often record notes and rituals on bones, shells, and metal plates instead of paper or parchment. These unusual works are art in their own right, each featuring rows of graceful Draconic script etched with the dragon's own acid.

Most black dragons keep their treasure well hidden and have a private viewing room for particularly prized possessions. Knowing that interloping inferiors were able to so much as see their hoard can drive a black dragon to a state of rage.

#### Connected Creatures

In contrast to most chromatic dragons, blue dragons see value in relationships with other creatures, even if the power balance in those relationships is always weighted in the dragon's favor. Though territorial, they are willing to allow creatures they consider their servants to live peacefully within their domains. Blue dragons are also more family oriented than many other dragons, and it's not unusual to find a multigenerational extended family of blue dragons sharing a territory. Other creatures need to tread carefully in such a place, for any injury or insult to one of the dragons is considered a strike against the whole family.

### Blue Dragon Lairs

Blue dragons make their lairs in deserts and other arid landscapes. They prefer warm climates, but if an otherwise ideal potential lair presents itself in a cold environment, they find ways to adapt. Instead of seeking out lofty domiciles, blue dragons build their lairs underground, burrowing beneath sand or using magic to hew rock into an intricate warren of rooms and tunnels that can be expanded to accommodate a growing family. Still, they appreciate the tactical advantages of height and usually create their lairs near a spire or cliff from which they can keep watch over their territory.

Though most blue dragons would be loath to the use the term themselves, their lairs are often surprisingly homey. They favor lairs that balance beauty and comfort and adorn them in soothing shades of blue, purple, and green.

#### Blue Dragon Lair Features

The blue dragon lair shown in map 5.3 is built in the ruins of an ancient city swallowed by desert sands. Some of the lair's chambers still contain the remnants of temples and other structures. The traces of this metropolis suggest that it was of significant size, but very little of it remains accessible in the area of the lair, since the dragon has collapsed the lair on intruders multiple times, rebuilding in a nearby portion of the ruins each time.

The walls of the lair are crystallized glass formed by the dragon's lightning breath. Most of its floors are loosely packed sand, with patches of rough stone showing through in some areas. The dragon has constructed a system of mirrors to bring in sunlight from chambers open to the sky, a system that not only brightly lights the interior but also heats the sand to a comfortable basking temperature.

The lair has the following features:

- **Entrance Chamber.** An open central cavern is the lair's primary entrance. The glass walls rise 30 feet to the surface and are fused with carved stone pillars and partial walls from the ancient city. A narrow, jagged piece of granite juts out horizontally from the wall near the top of the chamber, providing a perch from which the dragon can survey the cavern. The sand covering the floor of the chamber sometimes ripples or swirls ominously, perhaps in response to unpredictable desert winds, the dragon's magic, or some creature lurking beneath the sand.  
- **Hoard Display.** Just off the entrance chamber (toward the left side of the map), a smaller cavern with a worked stone floor contains the dragon's artfully arranged hoard. The glass walls of this chamber are studded with blue gems, and narrow light wells let in sunlight that bathes the room in dappled blue light. The ancient stone tiles on the floor contain lightning-charged traps to blast intruders.  
- **Dragon's Den.** The dragon sleeps in a large chamber in the bottom right of the map. The den is a well-preserved remnant of the ancient city; this gracious, elegant space is hung with silk curtains in shades of blue and purple, and its worked-stone floor is covered with plush, patterned rugs in complementary hues. It features a bejeweled and cushioned dais on which the dragon often reclines.  
- **Private Entrance.** Just above and to the right of the den is a small chamber open to the sky that the dragon uses as a private entrance to the lair. A secret door prevents unwitting creatures from wandering directly into the den.  
- **Treasury.** At the left end of the den, a door set under a blue-tiled arch leads to a smaller room where the dragon keeps relics that are too precious for the main hoard or that don't match the hoard's overall aesthetic.  

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-blue-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md)) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Misleading Mirage.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.  
- **Sudden Sinkhole.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and landing [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Blue Luster.** Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.  
- **Mirage Terrain.** The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.  
- **Sandstorm.** A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.

### Blue Dragon Treasures

Blue dragons have strict standards for what treasures they allow into their hoards and reject valuable objects that don't meet those standards. One blue dragon might keep only treasure that coordinates visually with the other items in the hoard, while another might focus on artwork from a particular period or seek out jewelry made for rulers in a certain region. Blue dragons' hoards are an enormous source of pride, and these dragons are insulted by offerings that don't meet their standards.

Blue dragons favor blue, purple, and green gemstones; art depicting oases and fountains; and fine textiles in cool colors. They also love scents that evoke storms and rain, and magic items that produce weather effects.

#### Connected Creatures

Brass dragons seek out the company of other creatures that can carry on an intelligent conversation. They favor the company of such creatures over all others, often to the point of not bothering to gather minions to do their bidding and ignoring worshipers who fawn over them.

### Brass Dragon Lairs

Brass dragons prefer to make their lairs in hot, dry, rocky areas—desert canyons, caves beneath arid mesas, or ancient stone ruins. Brass dragons often compete with blue dragons for lair sites, but are more likely to make a lair among rocks than to burrow under the sands.

Brass dragons like their lairs to be spacious and well lit; many lairs feature windows or skylights to let sunlight in. They respect skillfully wrought stonework and often take over canyon fortresses and similar structures when they're abandoned by their original non-dragon builders. Brass dragons are also capable of fine stonework themselves, and many meticulously carve out grand halls and galleries in which to store and display their hoards.

#### Brass Dragon Lair Features

The brass dragon lair shown in map 5.4 is an ancient ruin located within rough, stony canyons in a desert environment. The lair has the following features:

- **Column Guardians.** Massive columns carved to resemble warriors watch over the main entrance to the canyons; the dragon has given them whimsical names and ascribed unique personalities to them.  
- **Grand Hall.** At the deepest part of the canyon, a wide archway admits visitors to the grand hall that serves as the main lair. Regal statues stand bathed in sunlight admitted by huge shafts in the ceiling—wide enough for the dragon to climb up but not fly through. A much larger shaft above the rear chamber allows the dragon to fly directly in and out of the lair.  
- **Hoard Chamber.** The bulk of the dragon's hoard is stored in a partially collapsed chamber most easily accessed by way of a shaft in the ceiling. (A narrow gap in the fallen stones filling an old passageway might allow a Small or nimble character to squeeze in or out that way.) Eight heavy pillars surround a well in the floor and support the ceiling around the shaft.  

> [!note] Aasterinian
> 
> Like many greatwyrm dragons, Aasterinian is sometimes seen as a god. In fact, she is a cheeky and quick-witted brass dragon who often serves as a messenger for Bahamut. Her heightened dragonsight allows her to transmit messages easily between worlds, so all her incarnations know nearly everything any other one is aware of.
> 
> Aasterinian encourages all dragons to think for themselves rather than relying on the ideas or opinions of others. She cherishes learning and invention and often takes on Humanoid guise to offer patronage to mortal scholars and artificers.
^aasterinian

- **Unused Chamber.** A smaller chamber shown on the left side of the map is not currently used by the dragon, but it shows signs of having been recently used by visitors—either creatures welcomed by the dragon or ones that escaped the dragon's notice.  
- **Wells.** Four wells—three in the canyons leading to the main hall and one inside the hoard chamber—provide fresh water for the dragon and any guests, and they also serve as a sort of alarm system. As described in the "Monster Manual", whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of one of these wells, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence.  

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-brass-dragon.md)) brass dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Animate Statues.** The dragon chooses up to three statues in the lair that it can see. Each of these statues briefly animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus to hit and dealing 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit.  
- **Blast of Wind.** A mighty wind sweeps through the lair in a direction of the dragon's choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. If the dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction, and the wind can't knock the dragon [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- **Obscuring Sand.** Dust and sand fill the air within 120 feet of the dragon, making the area lightly obscured until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Cloud Companion.** A small, wispy cloud follows non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of "extreme heat" (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide").  
- **Talkative Denizens.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices. The air is filled with a deafening chorus of birds and small animals, and sapient creatures talk extensively.  

### Brass Dragon Treasures

Brass dragons prefer yellow, orange, and brown gemstones that coordinate with their own scales, and they favor precious art objects fashioned from brass, including items such as pitchers, braziers, and bells. They also cherish organic treasures, from finely crafted wood to textiles.

Brass dragons often invest items in their hoards with imagined personality. A wyrmling might have a favorite marble bust or onyx cameo to converse with, while an ancient dragon might have lively dialogues with an entire gallery of paintings, statues, and tapestries. A brass dragon who divides a hoard into separate caches often imagines those caches as individuals (or even groups of people) with independent personalities, and the dragon might spend time in different lairs to socialize with different "friends."

### Bronze Dragon Lairs

Bronze dragons typically dwell along rocky and inaccessible coastlines. Some make dry homes atop lonely sea stacks, while others favor completely submerged lairs in sunken ruins. Many seek out strongholds straddling land and sea, with both dry and flooded chambers.

When it comes to lairs, bronze dragons value function over form, and they study potential sites with a military commander's eye for defense. They appreciate the solidity of cliff-side caves or stone fortresses, often reinforcing existing defenses with clever traps and bulwarks. At the same time, bronze dragons understand that they are their own best defense in a siege, so they are careful to maximize their mobility with multiple ways in and out of their lairs.

#### Bronze Dragon Lair Features

The bronze dragon lair shown on map 5.5 is a set of sea caves that once served as a dwarven military outpost. The lair has the following features:

- **Sentinel Statue.** In a hidden cove sheltered from the sea, a statue of a dour elf queen watches over a small beach. The statue's eyes are magically warded to alert the dragon of intruders.  
- **Campaign Chamber.** Beyond the beach stands a pillared dwarven hall whose walls have begun to crumble near the entrances. Here the dragon grants audiences and presides over councils of war, surrounded by trophies chosen to remind viewers of the dragon's heroic history.  
- **Lofty Alcove.** Up a steep set of stairs at the bottom right of the map lies a dry chamber that serves as barracks for guests and a library for documents too fragile to survive in damp conditions.  
- **Island Larder.** Another elevated chamber carved into the cliffs of a small island abutting the beach (in the center right of the map) serves as a larder in case of a siege. It also houses a clever series of mirrors arranged throughout the stone to allow the dragon to observe the seascape unnoticed.  
- **Watery Caves.** Two chambers near the top of the map are accessible only via submerged tunnels, their entrances disguised with thick seaweed and boulders. The larger cavern on the right is the dragon's sleeping chamber, while the smaller on the left holds most of the dragon's hoard.

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-bronze-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-bronze-dragon.md)) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Ocean's Call.** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.  
- **Salt Burst.** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) slashing damage.  
- **Whelming Water.** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Phantom Escort.** Ghostly naval ships from an ancient armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon's help toward the dragon's lair.  
- **Underwater Pursuit.** Sailors glimpse the shadowy, illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with their vessel.  
- **Unfailing Faithfulness.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair find it nearly impossible to break a promise.  

> [!note] Fireflash
> 
> Also known as Khirsah, Fireflash is a gregarious and inquisitive bronze dragon with a keen interest in other species, especially dwarves and elves. During the War of the Lance, he was one of the first to answer the call of Silvara—the elf identity of the silver dragon D'argent—for the metallic dragons to join the conflict. During the Vingaard Campaign, Fireflash teamed up with a dwarf named Flint Fireforge and a kender named Tasslehoff Burrfoot to capture Highmaster Bakaris. Later, in the Blue Lady's War, Tasslehoff foresaw Fireflash's demise at the hands of the death knight Lord Soth—and was thus able to avert the dragon's grim fate.
> 
> After the wars, Fireflash faded from public view, but rumor holds that he continues his lifelong fight against evil, using his legendary skill in aerial combat to assist the Knights of Solamnia.

### Bronze Dragon Treasures

A bronze dragon's hoard is a history of the dragon's deeds, with trophies from fallen foes and payment from grateful petitioners resting alongside more mundane spoils of war and loot salvaged from shipwrecks and the seabed. Though these dragons rarely steal outright, a several-ton bronze dragon landing near—or even on—a merchant ship asking to trade often obtains extremely one-sided bargains from unnerved sailors.

Bronze dragons have a romantic view of their role as guardians of justice and prefer treasures that tie into their heroic narrative. Their hoards teem with weapons, armor, and magic items built for the battlefield—the more unique, the better. Stories matter to a bronze dragon, who would rather have the humble spear that felled a tyrant than a jeweled blade that's never seen combat. They love collecting and studying histories that can give them tactical insight or inspiration, as well as safeguarding artifacts they deem too dangerous to entrust to anyone else.

> [!note] Galadaeros the Sunset Flame
> 
> The copper dragon Galadaeros claims the islands known as the Purple Rocks in the Trackless Sea of Faerûn as his territory. For centuries, Galadaeros was content in his isolated home. Then the adventurer Ranressa Shiard was shipwrecked on the isles. Galadaeros befriended her after she made several failed attempts to slay him, and he eventually became mentor and ally to an adventuring company she named in his honor. The dragon provided the adventurers with a safe haven and received a share in their hauls in return.

### Copper Dragon Lairs

Copper dragons prefer dry uplands, hilltops, or mountainous foothills, where they build their lairs in caves, crags, or tunnels. Although sometimes natural, the passages and caverns of a copper dragon's lair might be carved out or expanded by the dragon's powerful acid breath.

Copper dragon burrows are often sinuous and winding, featuring twists, turns, and dead ends. Blank walls in the lair can conceal cunning hidden passages or might be stone or clay thin enough for the dragon to burst through them. The narrowest tunnels in a copper dragon's lair are just barely wide enough to accommodate the dragon's body, and they typically loop around and reconnect with themselves so the dragon can double back without having to reverse direction.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/fizbans-treasury-of-dragons/img/053-map-5-6-copper-dragon-lair-player.webp#gallery)

#### Copper Dragon Lair Features

The copper dragon lair shown in map 5.6 is a network of tunnels and large chambers dug beneath dry, rocky hills. The dragon's acid breath has left the surface of the stone here with a smooth, melted appearance.

The lair has the following features:

- **Concealed Entrances.** Four sloping tunnels emerge onto the surface among the hills, concealed by brush and tumbled stone. These openings allow the dragon to enter and depart the lair via multiple routes. Additionally, the sunken areas shown on the surface map correspond to areas where the dragon can burst through the ceiling to reach the surface.  
- **Secret Doors.** Concealed passages connect a number of the tunnels and chambers of the lair. Their secret doors are magical in nature, with the stone at a passage junction reshaping itself at the dragon's command to open a passage or close it again (similar to the effect of a [stone shape](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md) spell). Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 10 feet of one of these secret doors, the dragon becomes aware of that creature's presence and location. Each secret door radiates an aura of transmutation magic but is otherwise indistinguishable from solid stone.  
- **Hoard Chamber.** At the bottom of the underground map, a chamber hidden beyond two secret passages and carved out beneath a low hill contains the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The dragon often sleeps in the adjoining chamber, acting as a final line of defense against intruders.  

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-copper-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-copper-dragon.md)) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Laughing Gas.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with laughter until the end of its next turn.  
- **Torpid Energy.** The dragon chooses a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.  

#### Regional Effects

Either of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Distant Melodies.** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.  
- **Starlit Stones.** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The stones shed dim light in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain, but they no longer shed light.)  

### Copper Dragon Treasures

Copper dragons love burnished metals, particularly those with red and yellow tones, along with gleaming gemstones of all kinds and colors. They also like fine art objects, ranging from tapestries and woven rugs to paintings, sculptures, and ornate carvings.

Copper dragons also collect trophies and keepsakes of their best tricks and triumphs. These range from the crowns, armor, and weapons of long-dead foes to portraits, personal items, and oddities such as a single ancient coin or an arcane clockwork.

### Crystal Dragon Lairs

Crystal dragons seek out frigid, picturesque locations with clear views of the sky above to build their lairs. Then, like gem cutters seeking the perfect diamond, they spend much of their lives refining, polishing, and enhancing the beauty of their lairs.

Crystal dragons' lairs are often found in polar expanses, dizzying mountain peaks, and glacial floes. Some resemble icy palaces, with numerous balconies offering plentiful opportunities for sky gazing. Though ice and snow are the most common materials they use in the construction of a lair, crystal and other precious minerals feature prominently in certain areas. In this way, crystal dragons' hoards literally become the fabric of their homes.

#### Crystal Dragon Lair Features

The crystal dragon lair shown in map 5.7 is the home of a dragon who has spent considerable time shaping the pinnacle of the tallest mountain in a local range, transforming it into a series of gleaming spires. Though visitors are rare, the dragon has built a roadway that ascends the mountain to encourage travel to and from the lair.

The lair has the following features:

- **Ice Bridge.** The crowning glory of this infrastructural marvel is a wide bridge of ice that spans a chasm between a lesser peak and the lair.  
- **Anterior Spires.** Rising from the far side of the bridge are the lair's anterior spires. These solid, pointed shafts resemble inverted icicles more than towers and enclose a terraced, open-air amphitheater that serves the dragon as a parlor.  
- **Ice Sculptures.** In each of the areas enclosed by the anterior spires and the grand spires, four ice sculptures (shown as circled stars on the map) depict dragons of different kinds.  
- **Promenade.** A dragon-sized promenade winds upward from the anterior spires to the summit of the mountain.  
- **Grand Spires.** Like the anterior spires, the grand spires enclose a multi-tiered sanctuary of ice and snow. Trusted guests might be invited into this part of the lair.  
- **Central Spire.** The central grand spire is hollow, and built into its upper recesses are several icy perches where the dragon keeps the greatest treasures. As with everything in the lair, nothing is truly off-limits to visitors, as long as they show themselves to be peaceful and respectful (or very, very interesting). The most favored of the crystal dragon's acquaintances might even be gifted with a short trip to the very pinnacle of the central spire—the highest point in the local landscape—to take in the breathtaking view.  

### Crystal Dragon Treasures

Crystal dragons covet bright, opulent objects; baubles and trinkets that remind them of the stars, sky, sun, or heavens; and relics that aid in the divinatory arts. They prioritize beauty over value, so while they adore gemstones of all kinds, they prize fine quartz as highly as cut diamonds.

Crystal dragons enhance the natural beauty of their lairs with the treasures they collect, always trying to display those items they consider most precious in a tasteful and interesting way and recounting their elaborate histories to visitors whenever possible. Indeed, crystal dragons also see amassing such wonderful hoards as a way to attract new friends to the remote locations they inhabit.

### Deep Dragon Lairs

Deep dragons make their lairs in the recesses of the Underdark, often near the settlements of people with whom they have alliances or enmities. Their lairs are highly individual. Some are woven from networks of living fungus. Others are built upon the ruins of ancient cities or carved into caves near underground lakes.

Deep dragons' lairs serve as bases for the dragons' explorations, as well as providing safe storage for their hoards. When these curious creatures are away from home searching out new environments and seeing new vistas, they usually leave their lairs protected by servitors, allies, magic, traps, or some combination of these protections.

#### Deep Dragon Lair Features

A deep dragon lair might share the same basic structure as the sapphire dragon lair shown on "map 5.12", but instead of being formed from stone, it might consist of chambers hollowed out within a fungus network growing near an underground river. Whatever the setup, a deep dragon festoons the narrow, twisting passages between the lair's fungal walls with magical and mundane traps. A typical lair has the following features:

- **Connecting Passages.** Because a deep dragon lacks a sapphire dragon's ability to shape stone, add a few connecting passages or secret doors to otherwise inaccessible chambers, possibly including connections to the adjacent underground stream as entrances to the lair.  
- **Reception Hall.** The dragon uses one of the large chambers in the lair as a reception hall for allies and servitors. Like the rest of the lair, this chamber is lit by phosphorescent fungal blooms that give off soft green, blue, and purple light.  
- **Hoard Chamber.** The dragon's hoard is hidden away in a more remote chamber, draped in illusion spells and protected by traps and magical alarms. When triggered, those alarms summon the dragon's minions and allies first, followed by the dragon.  
- **Underground River.** Where an underground river runs along the outside edge of the lair, the dragon has slowed its flow with a rocky dam, creating a small pool in which to bathe and raise aquatic delicacies.  
- **Guest Suite.** A large chamber with connected smaller chambers, such as that seen toward the bottom of the map, forms a suite used as guest lodgings for visiting dragons. Though any treasures with significant financial or sentimental value to the host dragon are stored away in the protected hoard, these tastefully appointed visitors' chambers contain lesser treasures from inaccessible or storied locales, chosen to pique visitors' curiosity and provide an excuse for the host to tell these items' tales.  

### Deep Dragon Treasures

Deep dragons adore goods from distant lands, especially if those goods are unique. They hoard mementos of memorable hunts or exploring expeditions. They love gemstones in deep, dark colors, as well as those with an iridescent sheen, and they favor keeping their treasures in frames and on stands made of precious woods and set with even more gems.

It is rare to find a deep dragon hoard that is simply a pile of gems and treasures, for these creatures take great pride in organizing and displaying their possessions. They can easily spend multiple days guiding visitors from prize to prize, telling stories about favorite keepsakes—and when deep dragons visit each other, these tours can stretch out for days.

#### Connected Creatures

Dragon turtles are stolid and slow to anger. This temperament, combined with their disinterest in moral quandaries, allows them to get along with—or at least abide—most creatures they encounter. They frequently enter symbiotic relationships with other sea creatures that can bring them food or treasure, and they sometimes agree to work for creatures who ply them with generous sums of wealth.

### Dragon Turtle Lairs

Dragon turtles make their lairs in underwater caves and coral reefs. Most such lairs are situated deep beneath the waves near the ocean's floor, though some dragon turtles prefer coastal lairs with easier access to settlements they can trade with—or prey upon. Particularly reclusive dragon turtles seek lairs in even more remote locales, including deep-sea trenches or underwater volcanoes.

Dragon turtles are largely unconcerned with the design of their lairs and seldom work to improve them. A dragon turtle's primary concern when selecting a lair is ensuring that the site is large enough to accommodate the creature's prodigious size as the centuries wear on. After that, proximity to shipping lanes and freedom from irksome neighbors take precedence.

#### Dragon Turtle Lair Features

The underwater caves inhabited by dragon turtles are structurally similar to the seaside caverns where bronze and topaz dragons lair. When constructing a dragon turtle's lair, you can simply take a coastal map and translate it to an underwater environment or use the map as-is if the dragon turtle is content to lair near the surface.

As an example, "map 5.14" depicts a topaz dragon's lair in a seaside cavern, but it could be reimagined as a grotto in the side of a coral reef rising from a shelf on the ocean floor, with the following features:

- **Shelf Floor.** The sandy beaches represent the ocean floor at a depth of 100 feet, which is coated in a soft layer of fine sediment. The water around the lair is clear but dimly lit. The water's edge on the map represents the lip of the shelf, which descends to a dark plain twelve hundred feet below.  
- **Coral Reef.** The rocky cliff side depicts the contours of a coral reef that rises 80 feet above the shelf. The exterior face of the reef is covered with stinging corals.  
- **Reef Hollow.** The dragon turtle's lair lies in a hollow in the reef's interior that was bored out by a giant sea worm the dragon turtle killed. The original entrance at the level of the shelf floor ascends through a weed-choked tube that opens into the main chamber. Here, the dragon turtle nests in a recessed shelf along the back wall, where the creature can gaze down at the hoard scattered across the chamber floor. Although the lair is mostly flooded with seawater, a layer of breathable air is trapped in the top 3 feet of the main chamber.  
- **Coral Shelf.** A secondary entrance grants access to a coral shelf 40 feet above the shelf floor and illuminates the lair for a few hours each day with a shaft of dim sunlight.  

#### Lair Actions

As they are presented in the "Monster Manual", dragon turtles don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, you can give an [adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/dragon-turtle.md) or [ancient dragon turtle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-dragon-turtle-ftd.md) access to lair actions, increasing its challenge rating by 1. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon turtle can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon turtle can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Blasting Current.** A strong water current moves through the dragon turtle's lair. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon turtle must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be moved 30 feet in a direction of the dragon turtle's choice. On a success, the creature is moved 10 feet instead.  
- **Entangling Kelp.** Strands of spectral kelp reach out to ensnare creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the lair that the dragon turtle can see. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the end of its next turn.  
- **Steam Eruption.** Steam erupts in a 15-foot cone from a point on the ground the dragon turtle can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant creatures resistance to this damage.  

#### Regional Effects

The region containing a dragon turtle's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Diverting Currents.** Underwater currents push unwanted visitors away from the lair. While swimming in these currents, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in "difficult terrain"), even if a creature has a swimming speed.  
- **Elemental Portals.** Crevasses on the ocean floor within 1 mile of the dragon turtle's lair form two-way portals to the Elemental Plane of Water, allowing creatures of elemental water into the world to dwell nearby.  
- **Hot Water.** Geothermal vents heat the water within 6 miles of the dragon turtle's lair to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  

If the dragon turtle dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

### Dragon Turtle Treasures

Dragon turtle hoards frequently contain quantities of coral and pearls received as tribute from aquatic peoples, as well as chests full of coins, gems, and trade bars looted from shipwrecks. However, a dragon turtle's most prized possessions are treasures from the surface realm. Such objects are likely to be fashioned of metal or stone, as wood, cloth, and paper keep poorly in a dragon turtle's watery lair.

More so than for most dragons, a dragon turtle's hoard is likely to contain a motley assortment of treasures from disparate locales. Although many dragon turtles simply lump the elements of their hoard together into a nest, more inquisitive individuals take an interest in specific treasures, sometimes seeking out surface-world folk to inquire about an object's function or provenance.

> Raulothim is an [ancient emerald dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-emerald-dragon-ftd.md) who dwells in an extinct volcano known as the Pit of Stars, on the northernmost isle of Ruathym off the Sword Coast of Faerûn. Though most emerald dragons are paranoid by nature, Raulothim became especially so after having witnessed the arrival of planar travelers in Faerûn. Fearing that an invasion of his world by interplanar armies was inevitable, he has spent the past century collecting magic items that he hopes will enable him to survive the coming conflict.
> 
> Raulothim's drive to amass magic and his innate mistrust of anyone powerful enough to potentially threaten him make the dragon a dangerous adversary. However, he knows the surest way of safeguarding Faerûn against planar invaders is to keep a careful watch on all planar portals—and that to do so, he must rely on allies. Raulothim is therefore open to negotiating with adventurers willing to aid in that task—but only those he is sure he can trust. On more than one occasion, doubt has gnawed at Raulothim's mind, prompting him to preemptively strike against a previously trusted ally.

### Emerald Dragon Lairs

Emerald dragons make their lairs in caves and subterranean ruins, favoring locations that have been abandoned—and ideally forgotten—by other creatures. They are most comfortable in extreme heat, so they frequently choose lair sites in the sides of volcanoes or near geothermal vents.

An emerald dragon's lair is a maze of twisting tunnels, interconnected caverns, or crumbling ruins designed to disorient intruders. Circuitous routes within the lair provide the dragon with numerous ways to evade pursuit, while strategically designed choke points allow them to harry enemies with repeated ambushes. Emerald dragons frequently lay traps and alarms at the entrance points to their lairs, with older (and more paranoid) dragons employing several layers of such defenses.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/fizbans-treasury-of-dragons/img/066-map-5-8-emerald-dragon-lair-player.webp#gallery)

#### Emerald Dragon Lair Features

The emerald dragon lair shown in map 5.8 is a series of ancient vaults situated beneath a city built in the caldera of a dormant volcano. The vaults fell into disuse over a century ago when an upwelling from the lake at the caldera's center collapsed a portion of the vaults and flooded their halls with boiling water and noxious fumes. The stairwell leading up to the city was sealed to prevent the fumes from spilling into the streets above. Decades later, once the volcano's activity had subsided, the dragon moved in.

The lair has the following features:

- **Lava Tubes.** When the volcano is quiet, the dragon uses the lava tubes to come and go from the lair.  
- **Great Hall.** The emerald dragon resides in a grand rectangular hall near the center of the vaults, keeping one eye on the hallway leading to the flooded stairwell, never quite trusting that some covetous intruder won't find a way through.  
- **Treasury.** The dragon stores the finest treasures in a smaller chamber just above the great hall on the map.  
- **Watery Caves.** Near the bottom portion of the map, the vaults give way to natural stone caves; these caves slope down to a subterranean pool that connects to the caldera lake via an underwater channel. When the volcano is active, the waters here bubble up into the caves before draining down nearby lava tubes. During especially active periods, the waters surge up into the nearest halls and corridors before draining away.  
- **Underwater Cache.** The dragon stashes gold and gems in an underwater cave (at the bottom of the map), the entrance to which lies 40 feet below the surface of the subterranean pool.  
- **Hatchery.** The dragon has lovingly arranged the three small chambers in the top left of the map, farthest from the pools, as a hatchery. Visitors might discover an egg or an [emerald dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/emerald-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) in one of the chambers.  
- **Preserved Vaults.** The dragon has left most of the remaining areas of the vaults as they were when their creators abandoned them, taking great interest in the artifacts and architecture they left behind. Visitors who manage to convince the dragon they are not a threat are treated to a tour of the vaults, with the dragon acting like the curator of a museum.  

### Emerald Dragon Treasures

Emerald dragons are unusual among gem dragons in their preference for coinage over gemstones when amassing treasure. They are fascinated by the various designs of coinage and often strive to collect rare mintages. Most emerald dragons can precisely enumerate the names, amounts, and denominations of every bit of currency in their hoards.

Emerald dragons also prize cultural artifacts, especially relics with historical significance. They place great importance on an item's provenance, which can make it difficult to gauge how they might value any particular object. Despite remaining unmoved by the loss of a gold scepter deemed to be a replica, an emerald dragon might become enraged at the theft of a clay mug known to have been used by a legendary dwarf warlord while on campaign.

#### Connected Creatures

As is suggested by their name and nature, faerie dragons tend to prefer the company of Fey, as well as wild animals and any chaotic creatures who can appreciate faerie dragons' madcap sense of humor. At the same time, faerie dragons' limited attention spans often leave them starved for novelty, and nearly any creature can attract their interest—at least temporarily.

![Connected Creatures; Faerie Dragon Connections](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/connected-creatures-faerie-dragon-connections-ftd.md)

### Faerie Dragon Lairs

Faerie dragons go where the fun is. For many, this means dwelling near portals to the Feywild, enjoying that realm's unpredictable magic and boisterous revels. Yet it can just as easily mean residing among other peoples—stealing baubles from shrines, nesting in cluttered attics, or following explorers and other intriguing individuals on their travels. For as much as they love their homes and hoards, faerie dragons abandon both without a second thought if adventure beckons.

Faerie dragon lairs are as varied and eccentric as their owners. Some resemble simple animal nests, hidden away in secret crevices or woven of twigs and trash in the forks of ancient trees. Faerie dragons may also draw on the trappings of civilization, perhaps stealing a child's dollhouse for use as a manor or convincing pixies to construct them a silken bower. The most elaborate faerie dragon lairs are modeled off those of larger dragons, featuring multiple chambers and cunning traps.

#### Faerie Dragon Lair Features

An example complex faerie dragon lair is built around several hollowed-out chambers inside a large dead tree. The tree is decorated with the dragon's lesser treasures, its limbs draped with scrolls and scarves and set with glittering glass. You could use part of the underground portion of the copper dragon's lair ("map 5.6") to represent such a lair, with the scale reduced to 2½ feet per square, the hollow spaces tucked inside a massive tree trunk, and the passages running inside major branches rather than underground. A typical lair has the following features:

- **Trapped Entrance.** Just inside the knothole that acts as the lair's main entrance, the dragon has hidden a stolen hunting trap.  
- **Audience Chamber.** The passage opens up into the audience chamber, where the dragon lounges on a pillow and entertains diminutive Fey guests (or, in lieu of Fey, a family of very confused squirrels).  
- **Hoard and Larder.** Beyond the audience chamber are separate hollows for the dragon's hoard ("shinies") and larder ("nibbles").  
- **Sleeping Chamber.** The innermost cavity of the lair is the sleeping chamber, which the dragon has fastidiously lined with fragments of mirrored glass. The dragon preens and holds long, complimentary conversations with myriad admiring reflections here.  
- **Escape Tunnel.** From the sleeping chamber, a concealed escape tunnel leads out through a hollow root before emerging in a thick briar patch.  

#### Lair Actions

As they are presented in the "Monster Manual", faerie dragons don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, a green or [older faerie dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-violet.md) can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):

- **Chaotic Aura.** The faerie dragon creates misdirecting currents of air and magic around itself. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a ranged attack roll misses the dragon, reroll the attack against a random creature within 30 feet of the dragon that doesn't have total cover against the attack.  
- **Grasping Plants.** The faerie dragon causes roots and vines to temporarily grow around it; until initiative count 20 on the next round, the ground within 20 feet of the dragon is "difficult terrain".  

#### Regional Effects

The region containing a faerie dragon's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/fizbans-treasury-of-dragons/img/067-05-005.webp#center)

- **Compulsory Offering.** The first time a creature comes within 1 mile of the faerie dragon's lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or feel an overwhelming compulsion to leave an offering worth at least 5 gp stashed in an out-of-the-way place. The dragon immediately senses the location of this gift. A creature can be affected only once by this compulsion.  
- **Malleable Time.** Time is fluid within 1 mile of the faerie dragon's lair, flowing somewhere between half and twice its normal speed.  
- **Mischief Afoot.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 5 miles of the faerie dragon's lair feel the persistent urge to play pranks on others.  

If the faerie dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

### Faerie Dragon Treasures

Faerie dragons covet treasure as much as their larger draconic kin, but they are significantly less discerning. Faerie dragons' hoards are thus often a mix of genuine wealth and intriguing trash, with the dragons paying more attention to the wild stories they concoct around each item than the items' actual monetary value. These tiny egomaniacs can often be bribed with cheap but sufficiently respectful tributes of food and shiny trinkets, though their tendency to "borrow" any random object that catches their eye means a faerie dragon nest might also contain items of surprising value—often without the dragon realizing it.

> [!note] Nathair Sgiathach
> 
> Sometimes incorrectly assumed to be a god by non-dragons, Nathair Sgiathach (pronounced "nah-HAIR skee-HOKH") is the most famous of faerie dragon folk heroes. Like other faerie dragons, Nathair adores jokes—even those made at the dragon's expense—which makes Nathair particularly popular among their pixie, sprite, and other Fey associates. Though Nathair's magical powers are far greater than those of most faerie dragons (thanks in part to highly developed dragonsight), Nathair still prefers to resolve conflict with harmless pranks and absurdities, such as making an enemy's buttocks glow red and appear to sing folk tunes. When necessary, however, Nathair doesn't shy away from fighting to defend their beloved faerie folk. As such, some Fey teach their children to call Nathair Sgiathach's name in times of trouble, on the chance that the faerie dragon might be lurking invisibly nearby, as well as to put out ceremonial offerings of the faerie dragon's favorite food: apple pie.

### Gold Dragon Lairs

Despite their affection for people and their diverse cultures, gold dragons typically make their lairs in hidden places far from civilization, where only the most desperate and dedicated can find them. Many live in the ruins of vanished cultures, appreciating the beautiful inevitability of entropy and the reminder of how easily progress can be lost without careful tending. Crumbling shrines, towers reclaimed by the wilderness, and fallen fortresses all appeal to a gold dragon's sense of history—though they can be equally enraptured by picturesque natural settings. A gold dragon lair almost always involves water, be it a river, a lake, or an ocean shore.

#### Gold Dragon Lair Features

The gold dragon lair shown in map 5.9 occupies a misty river gorge and has the following features:

- **Waterfall Cave.** A rushing river cascades over the cliff in a scintillating waterfall, concealing the entrance to the dragon's cavern complex. Past this thundering curtain, a cave opens into the grand hall.  
- **Grand Hall.** Six glowing crystalline columns support the ceiling of this cave. The columns' colors reflect the dragon's mood, and they can animate to defend the lair.

> Tamarand is thoughtful, decisive, and surprisingly friendly toward non-dragons. He has strong bonds with the [storm giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) of the Galena Mountains and is a dedicated scholar of Humanoid cultures, having seen firsthand just how powerful such creatures can be when properly organized. After narrowly escaping assassination by dragon hunters in his former lair near Bloodstone Pass, Tamarand currently resides in the Vaasan wilderness and keeps his exact location a closely guarded secret.
^tamarand

##### Gallery

A passageway running left from the grand hall is lined with busts of allies and enemies from the dragon's past. This area contains the water mirror, a magical glass case filled by seepage from the river above, which the dragon uses to scry across both distance and time.

- **Sleeping Chamber.** At the end of the gallery passage, the dragon's sleeping chamber opens up, its walls lined with shelves holding books and useful magic items.  
- **Treasury Hall.** Armored doors within the sleeping chamber lead to the dragon's treasury hall, which features an 80-foot sheer drop into a viewing gallery.  
- **Hoard and Vault.** A chamber on the right side of the treasury hall holds the dragon's hoard, which serves to distract would-be thieves from a store of dangerous and corrupting artifacts hidden in a secret vault opposite the hoard chamber.  
- **Pantry.** A rough chamber off the right side of the great hall acts as the dragon's pantry, holding racks of pearls and other gems.  
- **Apartments.** In the top right corner of the map, a worked-stone alcove leads to Humanoid-scale apartments to accommodate the dragon's most honored comrades, as well as the dragon in Humanoid form.  
- **Pavilions.** Outside the lair, weathered pavilions climb the cliffs overlooking the waterfall's plunge pool, offering a convenient place for the dragon to meet visitors. Beyond the pavilions, an elegant pathway winds through self-manicuring gardens before ending abruptly in trackless wilderness.  

#### Additional Lair Action

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-gold-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon.md)) gold dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Beguiling Glow.** Warm light fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon; each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Beneficent Trail.** Within 10 miles of the dragon's lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon's lair.  
- **Emanation of Justice.** Creatures that spend a year within 6 miles of the dragon's lair value fairness and justice over their personal feelings.  
- **Liar's Revelation.** Within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the truth it was attempting to conceal. The first time a creature fails this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.  

### Gold Dragon Treasures

Gold dragons consider gems and pearls culinary delicacies, and they often have a section of their hoard that's as much pantry as treasury. Beyond such consumables, they prefer items they can learn from, whether rare historical or metaphysical texts, mysterious relics and curios, or puzzles and prophecies offering hints at the future.

Gold dragons also collect trophies marking important events and successes in their lives. But unlike many other dragons, they are just as likely to prize mementos of their defeats and mistakes, believing that such reminders are inherently instructive. Like bronze dragons, gold dragons often guard particularly dangerous artifacts as a form of public service, and thus prize clever magical or mundane defenses to keep their lairs safe and hidden.

#### Connected Creatures

Green dragons see other living beings as objects to subjugate, torment, or eat. Solitary by nature, they seldom tolerate the presence of other creatures unless their presence serves a purpose.

### Green Dragon Lairs

Green dragons prefer making their lairs in verdant places—jungles, bayous, pine forests, or anywhere with abundant vegetation that they can shape according to their desires. An older green dragon might indulge in horticulture, cultivating the local flora as befits their individual aesthetic. However, most green dragons are content to either excavate beneath trees and nestle among the roots or make lairs inside trees large enough to be hollowed out without compromising their structure.

Green dragons take great interest in woodland settlements when seeking lair sites. Though they are fully capable of modifying forests to their own liking, they find it easier and vastly more entertaining to take something belonging to smaller and weaker beings.

#### Green Dragon Lair Features

The green dragon lair shown in map 5.10 was an enormous banyan tree once sacred to the wood elves who lived around it. The original host tree around which the banyan tree grew is now dead and has rotted away, leaving a large columnar shaft within the trunk of the banyan that the dragon has expanded into a subterranean lair. The banyan continues to grow and to swallow up other nearby trees.

The lair has the following features:

- **Canopy.** The green dragon has teased the banyan's sprawling canopy into a bowl-like shape within which the dragon can comfortably lounge. Threaded through the branches are bones from the dragon's meals—some messily clustered among the leaves, and others deliberately arranged to create macabre dioramas for the dragon's amusement. Such grisly scenes can also be seen scattered throughout the lair as reminders of the dragon's power, and as distractions and warnings for would-be interlopers.  
- **Underground.** The hollow center of the tree gives access to the dragon's lair below, nestled among the banyan's sprawling roots. Three tunnels branch off from the vertical shaft at different levels—none of them at the very bottom. This means a creature that falls to the bottom must find a way to ascend at least as far as the lowest tunnel.  
- **Hoard Chamber.** All three passages eventually converge in the large chamber at the right side of the map, where most of the dragon's hoard is kept.  

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-green-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-green-dragon.md)) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Creeper Vines.** The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (see their entry in the "Monster Manual"). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.  
- **Lashing Root.** One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

#### Regional Effects

Either or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Inviting Whispers.** Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.  
- **Twisted Messengers.** The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.

### Green Dragon Treasures

Green dragons relish gems and jewelry whose palettes reflect their chosen forest environments, favoring viridescent colors and bursts of floral brilliance. Many develop vast collections of emeralds and beryls as a result, punctuated by amber, red rubies, tiger's eyes, bismuth, and the like. They likewise covet finely crafted items and works of art depicting unspoiled nature.

Unlike many of their kin, green dragons use the transformative power of nature to turn those valuables into truly unique treasures. By wrapping and threading treasures with rare vegetation and carefully applying their own skill as gardeners, green dragons meld nature and artifice into new masterpieces. This can lead to complications for would-be treasure hunters, as green dragons take enormous pride in their handiwork—so much so that intruders damaging the delicate arrangements of flower and vine that surround a treasure cache might come under attack before even touching any of the hoard's contents.

In the Feywild, moonstone dragons interact mostly with [pixies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md), [sprites](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite.md), and other Fey creatures who revere and serve the dragon. Outside the Feywild, they often prefer to communicate with other creatures through dreams.

### Moonstone Dragon Lairs

Often, a moonstone dragon's lair is not a single location, but rather a collection of personally significant places spread out across multiple planes of existence and connected through portals under the dragon's control. A lair might include a secluded grove on the Material Plane, a well-protected tower in the Feywild, and even a hidden corner of the Ethereal Plane. Moonstone dragons often use locations in the Feywild as their primary residences, locations on the Material Plane for entertaining guests, and locations on the Ethereal Plane for storage. Occasionally, though, a whimsical moonstone dragon delights in shaking things up, insisting that visitors come to the Border Ethereal for a meeting or sleeping in the middle of a heavily trafficked forest on the Material Plane.

Moonstone dragons navigate their multiplanar lairs by opening portals between planes at will. They sometimes forget to close those portals, allowing the inhabitants of one plane to wander into others.

#### Moonstone Dragon Lair Features

You can look to other maps in this chapter as inspiration for the scattered parts of a moonstone dragon's lair. For example, a well maintained and above-water version of the black dragon lair's tower ("map 5.2") makes a great Feywild audience chamber, while a vibrant, living version of the green dragon lair's enormous tree ("map 5.10") makes for a very comfortable bedchamber in a grove on the Material Plane. And features such as the cloud bridges of the silver dragon lair ("map 5.13") can be used for the parts of a moonstone dragon's lair that lie in the Border Ethereal.

### Moonstone Dragon Treasures

Moonstone dragons prefer silver, platinum, and mithral to copper and gold, and white or silvery gems to more colorful ones. Some are simply uninterested in treasures made of what they consider inferior metals, but others actively dislike copper and gold creations and consider them aesthetically offensive. People who mistakenly offer these metals to the wrong moonstone dragon sometimes wake to find all their silver—and memory of the past few days—missing.

In addition to their strong preference for certain metals, many moonstone dragons seek out artworks and relics with unique, whimsical, or absurd designs. The more fanciful an item's form is, the better.

#### Connected Creatures

Red dragons treat other creatures as potential servants or pawns, valuable only as long as they fulfill the dragon's needs. Many red dragons terrorize creatures into serving them—and sometimes into worshiping them as well. Others build up shadowy networks of manipulation and control, so many of their servants have no idea who the true ruler is.

### Red Dragon Lairs

Red dragons lair in mountain badlands and high, isolated peaks and hills, preferring warm caverns in the rocky depths beneath those landscapes. Lairs with natural geothermal or lava vents are highly sought after, as these features create an environment ideally suited to the dragons' taste.

Minions often attend red dragons in their lairs. These servants keep the place swept clean of refuse and watch out for intruders, while providing the imperious dragon with subjects to bully and command. Some minions worship the dragon and serve willingly, but others would escape if they could.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/fizbans-treasury-of-dragons/img/076-map-5-11-red-dragon-lair-player.webp#gallery)

#### Red Dragon Lair Features

The red dragon lair shown in map 5.11 is inside the caldera of an active volcano. [Azers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/azer.md) dug out and expanded the lava tunnels within the volcano's peak, just above the level of the caldera's lava pools. Although the azers are long since gone, their construction—and much of their lost wealth—now serves the dragon's needs. That construction also provides a network of tunnels too small for the dragon to use, but where other creatures can make their lairs.

The lair has the following features:

- **Caldera.** The steep sides of the caldera drop away from the edge of the cone, making a 60-foot descent to the lava below. The rough rock of the caldera is not overly difficult to climb, but the area grows increasingly hot as creatures descend.  
- **Pillared Hall.** The dragon sleeps in the large hall on the left edge of the map, where a row of crumbling pillars supports the ceiling and a narrow channel of lava keeps the hall hot.  
- **Hoard.** A side tunnel off the pillared hall descends 30 feet down a steep lava tube to a ledge above a pool of magma. Here the dragon has piled a hoard that gleams in the dull red light.  

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-red-dragon.md)) red dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Noxious Smoke.** A cloud of thick, dark smoke fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature other than the dragon that starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of its turn. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Searing Heat.** Searing heat spreads out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature that enters the affected area or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The heat lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a red dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Desertification.** Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, making the land parched and arid and most plant life withered and brown.  
- **Fiery Senses.** The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any open flame within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.  
- **Ominous Flames.** Open flames within 6 miles of the dragon's lair are tinged dark red, hiss and crackle constantly, and throw off embers and showers of sparks.  

### Red Dragon Treasures

Red dragons love gold above all other precious metals and are entranced by its gleam, its luster, and the sound of its chime. They amass gold coins and objects to form the bulk of their hoards, along with red and fiery gemstones such as rubies and fire opals. Red dragons favor items made of metal and stone, which can survive the test of time. Many such items in an [ancient red dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-red-dragon.md) hoard might be hundreds or thousands of years old. They tend to eschew treasures that burn, such as leather, paper, and cloth items.

For a red dragon, every treasure is a mark of pride and a personal trophy. Like a proud hunter, a red dragon relishes telling the tale of acquiring each individual relic or coin, glorifying the dragon's own deeds.

When he was struck a mortal blow to the heart, he replaced the injured organ with the balor. This transplant has lent a fiendish cast to his features, and his eyes glow with demonic flame. A secretive cult of Ashardalon's followers and spawn serves him on the Material Plane, furthering the dragon's schemes to attain godhood.

### Sapphire Dragon Lairs

Sapphire dragons make their lairs in enormous caverns and complex tunnel systems. As they grow older, they continually renovate their lairs, using their tunneling abilities and command over stone.

Sapphire dragons eventually create dizzying honeycombs of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow them to traverse the entire lair without ever being seen by intruders. The best-defended sapphire dragon lairs have no easily accessible entrances or exits at all, and trespassers who do find their way inside must then contend with a maze of corridors, dead ends, and steep inclines.

#### Sapphire Dragon Lair Features

The sapphire dragon lair shown in map 5.12 is a series of natural tunnels and chambers the dragon has adapted to serve as a lair. The lair has few natural entrances, so whole sections are inaccessible without excavation or magic, as the dragon can simply open doorways in walls whenever necessary.

The lair has the following features:

- **Disguised Entrances.** An otherwise unremarkable cave (shown at the top of the map) provides the main access to the lair by way of two sections of relatively thin crystal walls. The dragon can use a lair action to open or close passages through these walls throughout the lair.  
- **Cobweb-Choked Tunnels.** Adventurers who manage to access the other side of the cave's crystal walls discover a network of dark, cobweb-choked tunnels extending deep into the earth, set with natural steps and shelves throughout. The dragon spends little time in this part of the lair, visiting only when the spiders there need tending—or when the dragon needs a snack.  
- **Underground River.** A river flows along the right and bottom edges of the map, providing the dragon with fresh water and an alternative entrance. Originating on the surface, the river descends through narrow tunnels that eventually lead to the Underdark.

After losing both parents to beholder attacks, he fled to the Lake of Steam in southern Faerûn. There, he discovered the resting place of a martial order known as the Knights of the Crescent Moon, who had fought beholders in an ancient war. Bleucorundum found the knights held in stasis, awaiting the day they would be called upon to fight their ancient enemies again, and he vowed to guard them until they awaken. He styles himself the Sapphire Sentinel, self-appointed guardian of the Sleeping Legion. But his vigil is lonely, and his servitor [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) provide little companionship.
^bleucorundum

- **Hoard Caverns.** The bulk of the lair, filling most of the lower half of the map, comprises chambers the dragon uses to host guests and visitors. These caverns hold the bulk of the dragon's hoard, particularly art objects that are impressive but not irreplaceable.  
- **Sleeping Chamber.** At the heart of the lair, protected behind more thin crystal walls, the largest cavern serves as the dragon's sleeping chamber. A raised section studded with sapphire crystals offers a vantage from which the dragon can keep an eye on the chamber's access points. The dragon's most valuable treasures are stored here and in adjoining caves, and the walls of this central chamber are covered in art depicting various battles—many of which the dragon took part in.  

### Sapphire Dragon Treasures

Sapphire dragons covet items of martial significance above other treasure. Weapons and armor from epic conflicts are usually the centerpieces of a sapphire dragon's hoard, set alongside military histories, treatises on warfare, and battle mementos, as well as trophies from the dragon's own conquests of subterranean foes such as illithids and aboleths.

Sapphire dragons meticulously catalogue their hoards. Each dragon has a unique organizational system; some are straightforward, but some only the dragon can fully comprehend (weapons categorized by which armies they were used against, armor ordered by the ancestry of its last wearer, and so forth). Regardless of the system, a sapphire dragon takes pride in knowing exactly where any given item is and can recite a detailed history of that item while guiding curious guests to (or away from) it.

### Shadow Dragon Lairs

When dragons become aware of the Shadowfell's malign influence seeping into their territories, most scoop up their hoards and abandon any compromised lairs. But some are stubborn, prideful, or bitter enough to stay, even in the face of inevitable corruption. More often, a dragon is unknowingly swept up by the Shadowfell while asleep, awakening after a years-long rest to find that both dragon and lair have changed. In these cases, a shadow dragon's lair undergoes the same transformation as the dragon, becoming a shadowy, melancholic version of the original site.

Shadow dragons that are born on the Shadowfell or seek out new lairs after their transformations establish lairs according to the preferences of their kind, though they find comfort only in the most gloomy and cheerless of places. Reconciling these sometimes-contrasting urges can lead to some very unusual lair choices.

As an example, consider the red dragon lair in "map 5.11" as the lair of a red shadow dragon. In this case, the once-active volcano has now lapsed into dormancy. Its lava flows have cooled into a blackened, alien landscape. Ash coats the slopes of the caldera, picked up by the weird swirling winds common to this region and drawn into the atmosphere. Clouds of ash periodically cast the surrounding lands into deep shadow, before the fine grit once again falls to the ground in a hazy gray blizzard. The shadow dragon prowls the region during these hazes, rendered all but invisible by the eddies of ash.

In the heart of the lair, even the brightest light is muted, and creatures find their eyes playing tricks on them as details and distance are distorted. The shadow dragon rarely leaves this place except to hunt and is attended by dozens of shadows.

#### Additional Lair Action

Shadow dragons have access to the lair actions usable by untransformed dragons of the same kind. The effects of these actions might be cosmetically altered, seeming darker, gloomier, and more subdued. They might also deal necrotic damage instead of other damage types. At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) shadow dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Banish Light.** Any nonmagical source of illumination within a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon is snuffed out, and any spell that creates light within that same area is dispelled.  

#### Regional Effects

When a shadow dragon establishes a lair on the Material Plane, the region around the lair takes on some of the characteristics of the Shadowfell, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Brooding Despair.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair that have an Intelligence score of 5 or higher feel forlorn and hopeless.  
- **Dying Light.** Light is diminished within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, lightly obscuring the land in gloomy shadows.  
- **Gloomy Portals.** Some caves, caverns, pits, and other places of deep gloom within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Shadowfell, allowing creatures from that plane to dwell nearby.  

### Shadow Dragon Treasures

Shadow dragons retain the preferences of their original form when it comes to treasure. With each passing year, though, the more lustrous objects in their hoards begin to instill a sort of revulsion in the shadow dragons, much as sunlight does. Gleaming coins and shiny baubles sicken and anger them, and they blunt and tarnish these items to make them easier to look on. Ebony, onyx, and similar dark-hued valuables bring shadow dragons no particular joy, but they aren't as inherently repellent as silver, platinum, and diamonds.

Beauty fills shadow dragons with contempt, and that is true of the treasures they collect as well. Though they cannot abandon their hoards, shadow dragons hide them away even from their own sight. The most resplendent items are always the best hidden, and a shadow dragon's lair contains a great many secret caches. An ancient shadow dragon might have a hundred or more such repositories secreted about their territory, making stealing from a shadow dragon both difficult and dangerous.

Silver dragons enjoy the companionship of intelligent people, particularly when those folk have no idea as to the dragon's true identity. Silver dragons associate with just about any creatures, though, as long as they're confident those creatures have good intentions—or could be convinced to change their ways.

### Silver Dragon Lairs

Silver dragons make their lairs on mountaintops and in the clouds. Often, this has less to do with concerns such as security and privacy, and more to do with meeting or exceeding expectations. If humans, elves, and dwarves expect dragons to be found in such lofty environs, that's what they'll get.

This inclination toward using high-altitude locales as sites for lairs isn't without complications, though. Silver dragons often end up in competition with other dragons, notably red dragons, for control of such places. And even after establishing their lairs, silver dragons often need to fight to protect their dominion.

The lair of a silver dragon is always an impressive sight. Young dragons make their homes in icy cliffs, excavating space for themselves within the mountainside. Older silver dragons sometimes decorate their cliff-side habitats with ruins carefully collected from other places in the world. Depending on the dragon, a lair can be a multi-tiered affair, with its highest levels extending fully into the sky.

#### Silver Dragon Lair Features

The silver dragon lair shown in map 5.13 is composed of three connected sections—an antechamber, an open court, and a majestic temple. The lair has the following features:

- **Antechamber.** The antechamber was once an ancient throne room or mountain shrine, but time has eroded any clues as to its original builders. Its walls are hung with velvet tapestries featuring heroic figures performing a variety of glorious acts.  
- **Side Chambers.** A few small private side chambers allow the dragon (usually in Humanoid guise) to meet with visitors.  
- **Cloud Bridge.** From the antechamber, visitors travel upward along a path of clouds. The impressive route is not as dangerous as its lack of railings and the literal airiness of each footstep might suggest.  
- **Open Court.** Past the cloud bridge is an enormous expanse of smooth stone ringed with broken pillars, where the silver dragon hosts visitors in grand style. Though this court is often surrounded by clouds, the dragon can clear them away with a moment's thought, revealing a breathtaking view of the surrounding region.  
- **Majestic Temple.** The final section of the lair is a grand domed temple set with a plethora of comfortable furnishings. Here and there, souvenirs from the silver dragon's long life are positioned with great care.  
- **Under Temple.** A broad shaft in the temple opens into a treasury chamber below, where the dragon's hoard is arranged in gleaming splendor.  

#### Additional Lair Action

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-silver-dragon.md)) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Icy Grip.** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon. Each creature of the dragon's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures that have resistance to cold damage have advantage on the saving throw; creatures that have immunity to cold damage succeed automatically.

### Silver Dragon Treasures

More than anything else, silver dragons covet mementos from the people they interact with. Whether these are sentimental gifts worthless to anyone except their recipient or medals from a grateful monarch, silver dragons want them all. As such, many silver dragons have eclectic hoards brimming with trinkets and equipment from their own travels: from epaulets to hats, weapons to hunting horns, and even entire longships preserved with magic. Many also maintain a collection of portraits they've had commissioned over centuries to chronicle the ongoing changes in the art world. In some cases, these portraits are a dragon's most prized possessions.

Beyond such keepsakes, silver dragons prefer treasures that complement their natural coloration. Diamonds are much coveted, but also turquoise, malachite, and sapphires, all of pelagic hues like something plucked from the deep ocean. Some silver dragons also collect ornamental weapons or ingenious examples of technology.

#### Connected Creatures

Topaz dragons rarely tolerate any company but their own, and they are usually indifferent at best even toward their own kind. Moreover, their unpredictability means that even if a creature proves itself useful to a topaz dragon, it shouldn't count on being safe from the dragon the next time they meet. Topaz dragons rarely go out of their way to fight other creatures, however, with the exception of bronze dragons, for whom they bear an inexplicably intense hatred.

### Topaz Dragon Lairs

Topaz dragons are happiest by the sea. They spend most of their time basking in the sun and have no desire to get wet, beyond enjoying a bit of sea spray in the air. But they love being able to see the water, so they build their lairs on the heights of seaside cliffs or near perfect sunbathing beaches where they can best accomplish this.

Their preference for lair sites frequently brings topaz dragons into conflict with other creatures, since they resent having to share their chosen scenic locations with anything that isn't food. They often abandon lairs to seek new vistas, so the interiors of their lairs often feel less finished than those of other dragons. Topaz dragons decorate their lairs with mirrors to make them look bigger and brighter, as well as fabric and objects in golden shades that complement their scales. They obsessively organize their hoards but almost never show them to anyone else.

#### Topaz Dragon Lair Features

The topaz dragon lair shown in map 5.14 is situated among the rocky cliffs and beaches of a rugged coastline. The lair is set in a cavern complex near the top of the cliffs, 50 feet above the sandy beaches, outcroppings, and islands below. It has the following features:

- **Outcropping.** A flat outcropping with sheer limestone sides, mostly bare, offers a comfortable spot where the dragon can bask in the sunlight and watch the waves below.  
- **Entry Tunnel.** A long tunnel leads from the outcropping to the heart of the lair.  
- **Decorated Caverns.** The walls of the lair are mostly still in their natural state but are hung with the dragon's collection of nautical paintings, mirrors, and sun-colored tapestries. Numerous gold-and-glass hanging lanterns are suspended from the ceiling, giving the place a warm, cozy glow. (The lanterns might be magical or maintained by minions.) The floors are covered with plush sand-colored carpets.  
- **Hoard Chamber.** A small chamber in the upper left corner of the map contains the dragon's hoard. The area is decorated in a similar fashion to the main chamber, and its collected jewels and gold are painstakingly organized and tucked into chests stacked on gold-chased shelves.  
- **Clifftop Path.** A second exit from the cave allows the dragon quick access to the lair and leads to a narrow path bordered on the right by a sheer 50-foot drop and on the left by a cliff wall just as steep and devoid of hand- or footholds. The dragon has festooned this path with tripwire alarms and minor booby traps.  
- **Islands.** Three small islands jut from the water below the outcropping. The largest features cliffs that rise steeply to a plateau 40 feet above sea level. The dragon sometimes basks here as well and takes many meals atop the plateau.  

> [!note] Astilabor
> 
> Like many greatwyrms, the topaz [Astilabor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/topaz-greatwyrm-ftd.md) is often mistakenly identified as a dragon god—in this case, the god of greed. In many ways, she is an archetype for all dragonkind, embodying the desire to acquire and hoard wealth. Her desire is born not of greed, though, but rather from her study of the Material Plane, its magic, and dragons' interconnection with both. Dragons on many worlds acknowledge Astilabor as they establish new lairs to host their hoards, linking them to the magic of the surrounding region.

### Topaz Dragon Treasures

Topaz dragons despise anything made of bronze but love to hoard gold, as well as yellow and orange gems that coordinate with their scales. They also favor treasures with a nautical theme; images of the sun; and mirrors, which they use to gaze at their own reflections and to redirect sunlight into their caves.

Topaz dragons like to keep their lairs well lit and can spend endless hours watching the play of light upon their treasures. They sometimes obsessively arrange their hoards by minute gradations in color and set up mirrors around a hoard chamber to make the mass of treasure appear bigger. But whatever pride topaz dragons take in their hoard, they have little desire to show it off, so even those rare creatures who maintain cordial relationships with a topaz dragon are unlikely to ever see the dragon's treasures.

#### Connected Creatures

Savage and territorial by nature, white dragons seldom set out to make alliances, though some come to understand the utility of doing so as they age. More often, white dragons encountered in the company of other creatures have been forced into an uneasy accommodation or a resentful servitude because they lack the power to dominate those companions outright.

### White Dragon Lairs

A white dragon's lair is a place of freezing temperatures and profound solitude. Forgotten mountain holds, inaccessible chasms, and frozen caverns buried deep beneath glacial ice are typical of the places white dragons seek out to make their homes.

White dragons enjoy the mournful sound of the wind and frequently choose lairs with long, winding tunnels down which icy gusts can travel. They seldom work to improve their lairs, but when they do, it is often to channel wind currents to create effects the dragon finds pleasing. The labyrinthine tunnels and the mirror-like icy surfaces in a white dragon's lair confound would-be thieves and might foil their escape.

#### White Dragon Lair Features

The white dragon lair shown in map 5.15 is a natural stone grotto set in a cliff side capped by a glacial ice sheet. It has the following features:

- **Cave Entrance.** The entrance is a cave that opens into the cliff's rocky base. When the dragon goes out hunting, a wall of ice blocks the cave's entrance. But while in residence, the dragon leaves the cave mouth open to let the lair "breathe."  
- **Frozen Stream.** The cave's interior is a twisting stone tunnel carved out by a subterranean stream, now frozen over by the dragon's presence. The stream spills down in stages over low, frozen cascades, creating an icy stairway.  
- **Dining Hall.** A small chamber adjoining the stream just inside the cave's entrance is the dragon's dining hall; it contains the horrid remnants of recent meals.  

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/fizbans-treasury-of-dragons/img/085-05-009.webp#center)

- **Rocky Grotto.** Past the topmost cascade is the grotto floor, a rocky cavern dimly lit by blue light filtering through the icy vault high above. The largest of the dragon's frozen trophies are scattered about the grotto.  
- **Low Cavern.** Beyond the grotto, the stream leads to a low-ceilinged cavern the dragon used as a sleeping place when smaller; it might now serve as a home for the dragon's minions.  
- **Upper Cavern.** High above the grotto floor is a large cave where the dragon rests and stores the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The cave opens onto a narrow stone shelf that juts out from the grotto's walls and nearly encircles it. The shelf is stable but icy, and there is no obvious means of reaching it except for flying or scaling the sheer rock walls.  
- **Icy Dome.** Above the shelf is a frozen dome riddled with icicles. The ice here is just thin enough for the dragon to burst through to the open air if a quick escape is necessary.  

#### Additional Lair Actions

At your discretion, a legendary ([adult](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon.md) or [ancient](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md)) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Blinding Sleet.** Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Whirling Wind.** A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for rules on "strong wind"). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.  

#### Regional Effects

Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the "Monster Manual":

- **Biting Chill.** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for rules on "extreme cold"). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.  
- **Mirror Ice.** The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.  

### White Dragon Treasures

White dragons favor gems and precious metals that mirror the cold sparkle of ice. The floors of their lairs are often scattered with diamonds, moonstones, and quartz, as well as with silver and platinum coins, creating the impression of a river of stars when light spills across it. Though white dragons still value gold and copper, they usually bury such metals in pits filled with rock or snow to keep their yellow gleam from spoiling the look of their lair.

> [!note] Rime
> 
> Rime is a prisoner to her past. This now- [ancient white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) was raised in captivity, bred as a mount for an ancient knightly order. Mithral plates were magically fused to her skull and breastbone, bearing an enchantment binding her to the service of her rider. And though that rider and their order have been dead for centuries, the magic of the mithral plates still binds Rime to the place of her rider's demise. Only in the winter, when her powers are at their peak, can she range out from the ruined citadel that has become her lair to terrorize surrounding lands.
> 
> Rime's past experience makes her suspicious of all Humanoids, and she frequently vents her wrath on them without provocation. However, she suffers the presence of the cultists who have taken up residence in her lair, since they bring her food during the long months when she cannot hunt. Rime also seeks a way to rid herself of her mithral shackles and will warily engage in conversation with spellcasters who might help her. Failing that, her plan is to continue to amass treasure during her winter raids until she is powerful enough to break her bonds completely.
^rime

The greater part of a white dragon's hoard consists of trophies taken from defeated foes. Although these trophies include items such as mighty weapons or ornate regalia that are valuable treasures in their own right, they can just as easily be worthless junk. A white dragon hoards trophies not for their material value, but as testaments to the dragon's dominance. An [ancient white dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) lair is a literal memory palace and a maze of rime-encrusted treasures that recount the story of the dragon's many victories.

# Chapter 2: Growing Your Franchise
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated, p. 9* 

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/002-02-01.webp#center)

As a run-of-the-dungeon adventurer, your character might kick through countless locked doors, lay down ancient magics, or send any number of monsters to the afterlife in the pursuit of fame and treasure. But when you take your place as part of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you become something more than a mere hero. As a member of an elite group standing on the cutting edge of the adventuring business, the brand precedes you. And sure, sometimes the blades on the cutting edge are kind of sharp. But with Head Office at your back, you know you have the best tools in the industry at your disposal. And maybe the basic funeral packages Acq Inc offers aren't that great, but there are some tasteful upgrades you might consider.

This chapter introduces the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise and the rules for running it. Franchise benefits are organized by level tier, and include an ever-expanding business territory, wide ranges of options and upgrades for a franchise headquarters, and more. This chapter also introduces company positions—a new set of rules for franchise characters granting access to unique, tier-based abilities that can help a party stand out in a crowded marketplace. And because taking a vacation is no excuse for diminished returns, an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise can make use of expanded rules for downtime and franchise activities, allowing players to help shape the business and the narrative of the campaign even when they aren't in the field.

## Franchise Advancement

A license to operate an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise comes with nearly limitless benefits! When your party starts a franchise, you receive a region in which to operate, a franchise headquarters, and a majordomo to assist with basic headquarters needs. As your characters become accomplished adventurers (and continue to contribute to Head Office coffers), Acquisitions Incorporated helps your franchise gain even greater benefits! See the following "Franchise Advancement table" for a summary of what you get at each rank.

### Franchise Rank

By default, a franchise rank is gained at each tier of play (beginning at level 1 and advancing when the average party level reaches level 5, 11, and 17). The DM might choose to increase or decrease the level of play at which franchise tiers are gained, or tie advancement to story or campaign goals. Each franchise rank provides characters the opportunity to operate in a larger geographic area, hire staff and direct them to execute franchise tasks, and customize the franchise headquarters.

### Licensed Region

When a franchise first starts out, it is licensed to operate in a small region focused on a settlement or similar mercantile point. You might think this means Head Office doesn't trust its new franchisees. Not at all! No! It's just so much easier to support a group when they start in a focused area. Don't worry at all that a rival Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will outmaneuver you. It seldom happens. Keep growing your business, and the Acq Inc license will expand to help you find more customers and increase your brand presence.

Within your licensed region, you have the right to use the full power of Acquisitions Incorporated branding. No other Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will operate in your region, and all the region's customers are exclusively yours. Of course, non-Acquisitions Incorporated rival organizations might be present. You are expected to drive them out of business. (Or give them untimely deaths. You do you.) A franchise can build or operate any number of locations, such as warehouses and trade shops, within its region. You may not maintain property or establish formal operations in a settlement outside your region, even if you ship goods to that location.

You may not use the Acquisitions Incorporated brand outside your licensed region without written, documancer-generated permission, since those areas might belong to other licensees. You can adventure outside your territory, of course, and can assist or work for other organizations. However, you are expected to prioritize missions given to you by Head Office.

#### Rank 1: Settlement

Acquisitions Incorporated grants your franchise a license to operate in a settlement, and in a territory around the settlement approximately 10 miles across. If your region includes a coastline, you are granted the rights to engage in sea trade within that region. You can ship goods (over land, water, or air) to one city or other settlement outside your region. (The DM approves this location, and might wish to establish your franchise's relationship with it through play as part of the campaign.)

#### Rank 2: Small Territory

Your license now expands to include a region similar in size to a province or a small kingdom—typically up to 50 miles across, with your starting settlement somewhere within. (For mapping purposes, this area is roughly the same scale as a province-scale map. See ""Mapping Your Campaign"" in chapter 1 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide".) You are expected to expand your trade and branding throughout the region. You'll seize new markets, develop new offerings, increase your network of contacts, and safeguard the king and queen's spoiled kids so the monarchs think of you positively. You can ship goods to two cities or other settlements outside your region.

> [!note] Group Dynamic
> 
> An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is a group effort. Many decisions must be made in the course of running a franchise and playing in an Acq Inc campaign, and it is assumed that all players will be involved in making those decisions. Whenever this book talks about a franchise collectively—and in particular, when it talks about decisions being made by a franchise—the understanding is that all characters (in the game) and all players (at the table) have an equal say in determining a franchise's fortunes and fate. Sure, arguments will crop up from time to time. But that kind of roleplaying is a big part of what makes an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.
^group-dynamic

#### Rank 3: Large Territory

Your license grows to include a broad expanse of provinces, a few small kingdoms, or a large kingdom or federation, covering a territory the size of half the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. A large territory might overlap with other Acquisitions Incorporated regions, though you are theoretically working with (and perhaps overseeing) smaller franchises rather than working against them. You can ship your goods to any destination, and can assign staff to a city to which you ship goods—solely to oversee the distribution of those goods, and certainly not to compete with rivals. Don't cause too much trouble and Head Office will stay happy.

#### Rank 4: Limited Extraplanar

Your franchise now includes specific locations located on other planes of existence. These could include such fabled trading locations as Sigil, the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or a githyanki outpost in the Astral Plane. Your license to operate in these regions is not exclusive. Your region on the Material Plane might or might not expand, depending on both your performance and the goals of the campaign. The DM might establish extraplanar locations through play. Failing—or succeeding—in securing an extraplanar location could create interesting and deadly rivalries!

![Franchise Advancement](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/franchise-advancement-ai.md)

### Staff

"Chapter 5" of the "Player's Handbook" details the costs for characters to hire skilled and untrained hirelings. As is true of characters in any campaign, Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees are free to hire any NPCs they want, within whatever limitations the DM wants to set on such employment. But the franchise itself comes with a number of staff whose wages are part of the franchise's cost, providing not only labor but story potential.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/003-02-02.webp#center)

Each franchise rank grants a number of new staff members who live in the franchise headquarters or within its geographic scope. The cost of maintaining staff is included in a franchise's costs. Each staff member has a proficiency bonus equal to 2 + the franchise's rank. For skilled hirelings or crew, the DM might substitute NPC statistics when that seems appropriate. Each time a franchise gains a rank, existing staff members can be gifted with early retirement (that is, fired), and replaced alongside new hires that fit the franchise's needs.

A franchise might engage all kinds of hirelings and agents over the course of a campaign, but specialized franchise staff fall into four different categories.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Omin Dran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md)  
> 
> An employee is like a friend you pay.

#### Majordomo

A majordomo administers a franchise headquarters. They typically reside within the headquarters and seldom leave it, sending out communications through a dedicated messenger (at no extra cost, and traveling on foot or by means the franchise provides). A majordomo is proficient in Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) and two skills of the DM's choice.

The DM is encouraged to use the rules for creating nonplayer characters in "chapter 4" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to detail the majordomo, giving this individual a vibrant personality and backstory. The majordomo's goals should be aligned with the franchise and with Acquisitions Incorporated as a whole, allowing them to properly act as an ally and steward for the party.

It can be helpful to a campaign to provide the majordomo with a backstory that complements a franchise's evolution over time. A sage might research how the franchise gains new capabilities. Or perhaps the majordomo was the pilot of a vessel capable of planar travel, who slowly applies those features to the headquarters. A majordomo of a franchise modeling itself after a spy organization might constantly invent devices for the franchise, making continuing progress as the party returns with gold, lore, and resources.

> [!note] Filling Positions
> 
> A franchise's majordomo can take a company position (see the next section) in addition to the positions taken by the characters. Especially with a small party, it can be good to have a majordomo fill a useful position that no character wants to take. No other NPCs can take company positions.
^filling-positions

#### Untrained Hirelings

As described in the ""Services"" section in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook", untrained hirelings provide general labor, and can function as builders, cleaners, porters, and other workers. Untrained hirelings can work for a franchise or its allies, perhaps tending a garden for a noble family or helping a merchant unload cargo from ships. They will not engage in combat and do not leave the headquarters to join the party on adventures.

The DM should name at least one hireling who acts as a leader for any interactions with groups of untrained laborers. Providing hirelings with a similar background (such as a band of ex-soldiers or reformed criminals) can add personality to the group. Consider using the rules in "chapter 4" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide", applying the results of a single set of rolls to the entire group. Those hirelings could all shave their heads zealously, be brawny but absentminded, play various musical instruments, use colorful oaths and exclamations, and so on.

Group ideals, bonds, and flaws, along with a shared history, can all add depth to a group of untrained hirelings. Those musicians might be connected by the ideal of tradition, and bound to the franchise to protect a cultural heirloom they value above all else. Their flaw and secret could be that they stole the heirloom from their former employer, a rival merchant organization. Over time, the same hirelings might show up as part of the characters' adventures time and time again, revealing aspects of their past and creating story continuity.

> [!note] Job Title and Benefits
> 
> What the "Player's Handbook" calls untrained hirelings are often referred to as "subemployees" within an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, while skilled hirelings typically gain the more prestigious title of "intern." It's entirely up to individual franchisees what awesome titles they bestow upon their staff members in addition to (or, indeed, in lieu of) perks such as an occasional wage.
^job-title-and-benefits

#### Skilled Hirelings

![Happy Franchise Staff](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/004-02-03.webp#center)

A skilled hireling has one or more skill, weapon, or tool proficiencies. A franchise can request skilled hirelings when needed (up to the maximum allowed by franchise rank), with the players describing the concept behind the hirelings and selecting one proficiency for each. The DM can then customize the hirelings as desired, perhaps by adding additional proficiencies or adjusting their combat statistics.

Skilled hirelings can be fired and hired as needed. A franchise might bring on a couple of thugs to act as distraction during a street fair, then release those NPCs to hire a different set of skilled hirelings to conduct franchise tasks and downtime activities.

Hirelings cannot perform more than one task at a time. A full complement of skilled hirelings assisting the party on a mission precludes other skilled hirelings from helping with franchise tasks and downtime activities until the mission is completed. As with untrained hirelings, detailing a group background and assigning personality characteristics to a group leader can make for a fun play experience.

##### Adventuring

Characters can adventure with up to one skilled hireling at a time. An NPC with a challenge rating of roughly half the franchise rank works well for most adventures, providing utility without disrupting balance. The loyalty system described in "chapter 4" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" can be used to determine whether the hireling remains dedicated to the party's goals, or the DM can make that decision on the basis of how the adventure plays out and the characters' attitude toward the adventuring NPC.

##### Tasks and Downtime

Skilled hirelings can also be assigned to franchise tasks, as described in the "Franchise Tasks and Downtime" section later in this chapter.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Jim Darkmagic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jim-darkmagic-ai.md)  
> 
> Hirelings are kindling in the fire of opportunity!

#### Crew

Crew are skilled hirelings trained in tasks pertaining to the physical maintenance of a franchise (for example, servers or gardeners) or the navigation of a mobile headquarters (sailors for a seagoing franchise, engineers for a giant hollow statue, and so on). Crew do not leave a franchise and cannot perform franchise tasks. They typically run rather than fight back when attacked, though the DM can decide otherwise. If a mobile franchise headquarters requires more crew than is granted by the franchise's rank, the characters must hire the remainder (typically at the skilled hireling cost of 2 gp per day).

Hiring crew can become a cooperative roleplaying activity. Potential crew might hear of Acquisitions Incorporated or the party's exploits and come to interview with the franchisees. Choices might be offered by the DM, as between a team of ex-militia who lost their last battle and a crew of recently released criminals who swear they were wrongly imprisoned. Names, personalities, and roles can be assigned to crew by the DM and the players. Rather than simply interacting with the cook and the first mate, the characters can instead deal with Pepper, the chef who loves spicy foods, and Brazen, the veteran sailor who always talks back, creating the potential for entertaining interactions as the franchise grows.

### Headquarters Features

Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office provides the members of each franchise with a place to call their own. It might not be initially impressive (cleaning any old blood stains is the franchisees' responsibility). But over time, characters in an Acq Inc campaign are granted resources to help construct the headquarters of their dreams! Each franchise rank affords the characters a number of choices, allowing customization and creativity. Sample features are provided as guidelines, but a franchise's features can include literally anything decided on and agreed to by the players and the DM.

#### Group Design

When selecting a feature, the characters must make decisions together—meaning the players must do the same. Deciding on the features of a headquarters should be a team effort, both in game and around the table. What should a headquarters look like initially? Do the characters prefer to travel by land or by sea, or to operate from a fixed location? Is a ruined keep more interesting than an old vine-covered wizard's tower in the woods? Is the headquarters remote or within a settlement—perhaps an old tavern or caravansary the characters can restore?

It can be helpful to think ahead as well. Acquisitions Incorporated is known for mobile franchises, helping to bring goods and adventuring services to distant locations. When a franchise headquarters becomes mobile, will it fly or sail? Will it gain the power to teleport across the land? Will it sprout legs and walk?

Everything depends on the type of headquarters. The top of a wizard's tower might detach and shoot skyward like a missile. Or a franchise's headquarters might be contained within a giant statue, which over time gains the power to move farther and faster. A castle or other stationary structure could contain a portal or teleportation circle, allowing the characters to travel to distant locations while the stronghold remains behind.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Viari](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/viari-ai.md)  
> 
> There are a lot of perks to being an intern that people overlook. The hours are very flexible, you get a 20 percent discount in the gift shop, you get a bathroom break every four hours as long as you ask your supervisor first. And sometimes if you go into the conference room after a meeting, there will be a bunch of soda and leftover subs. You can just take as much as you want! As long as nobody sees you.

#### Incorporating Benefits

The characters' collective skill proficiencies, tool proficiencies, backgrounds, and positions within their franchise could all impact the design and construction of a headquarters. A glassblower might make beautiful stained-glass windows, while a herbalist fills the headquarters with pleasing or mysterious scents. An acolyte could outfit a small area of the headquarters as a chapel, while a sage sources a unique desk at which to work. Such features are cosmetic or limited in impact, but enable players to feel more interested and invested in their headquarters.

#### Starter Headquarters

Each franchise's starter headquarters is a mundane site, which has often been selected or handed down by Acquisitions Incorporated. The characters' initial base of operations could be a ruined tower, a worn horse-drawn carriage, a beat-up fishing boat, a dilapidated store or farm, or any similar structure or site. The DM might direct the characters toward a single ideal location, or might provide a range of options for players and characters to choose from. And of course, many potential franchise locations will have an interesting past—a haunted mansion, a mysterious lighthouse, an old wizard's tower filled with malfunctioning magic, and so forth.

The DM approves the headquarters concept and decides how large or small the initial structure can be, as well as any useful features. DMs and players can work together to create a map of the headquarters and its surroundings. "Chapter 5" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" can help detail both wilderness and urban locations.

> [!note] Lifestyle Expenses
> 
> Whenever characters are in residence at their franchise headquarters, they can automatically benefit from a minimum lifestyle—poor at rank 1, modest at rank 2, comfortable at rank 3, and wealthy at rank 4. The normal costs associated with that lifestyle for franchisees and select staff are subsumed within the overall cost of running the franchise. Outside the franchise headquarters, normal lifestyle expenses apply.
^lifestyle-expenses

Many franchisees will use their starter headquarters as a point for expansion, adding new features, new rooms, new levels—and, of course, new magic as the franchise grows in rank. Other campaigns might be better served by having the franchise change headquarters at different stages. Characters might start out in a ship, then move to a castle, then take possession of a unique magical headquarters in the end. Any potential headquarters site might be discovered by the characters as part of the campaign, or sites might be suggested or allocated by Head Office.

Any of the following suggestions can make a great starter headquarters, or can provide inspiration for other headquarters features.

##### Abandoned Lighthouse

Raided by orcs who left no one alive? Those are probably just stories. And even if true, the orcs won't come back (probably). This abandoned lighthouse headquarters is strong enough to stand against any storm (probably), and many of the leaks have been fixed already. And just look at that cool light up top, and the oversized storage cellar. Docks close by are perfect for a starter franchise that comes into possession of a boat, and are also a sign of the lighthouse's importance to coastal trade. Commandeering it will likely win over the locals and maybe even the region's royalty!

##### Beat-Up Keelboat

Any franchise can take to the seas in this new (okay, very used) [keelboat](/3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/keelboat.md)! Pirates killed the previous owners, and Head Office picked it up for an excellent price. Most of the holes in the hull are repaired, and the sails are only a little bit moldy. Even better, there's a small covered area in the rear protected from the elements that makes a perfect living space! The keelboat holds a half-ton of cargo, and might even come with reduced docking fees at some ports of call.

Statistics for a standard [keelboat](/3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/keelboat.md) are found in [chapter 5](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/owning-a-ship-airborne-and-waterborne-vehicles.md) of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". The DM might adjust the number of people the boat can comfortably carry, but having such a headquarters typically implies that most franchise staff are itinerant or live elsewhere in whatever settlement is the boat's primary port of call.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Omin Dran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md)  
> 
> I don't have rivals. I have partners who simply don't know it yet.

##### Old Tavern

With just a little work and some better furniture, this place could be the talk of the town. The tavern is certainly not haunted. Seriously, no one listens to those rumors. But if it were, and if the story was spun the right way, the marketing potential could be huge. Some even say that the ghosts (which totally don't exist) like to sing, so that's a plus! The kitchen is already stocked with plates, mugs, and lots of knives, and a few rooms upstairs are ready to rent out to travelers.

##### Worn Carriage and Horses

This humble, worn carriage, previously owned by a now-defunct trading company, makes a perfect starter headquarters. The carriage's exterior is weathered wood, and the interior seats and cushions have seen better days. Still, it offers all the perks of home plus the ability to change the neighbors every time you take to the road.

The rear of the carriage features a generous cargo space for up to 500 pounds of goods, and is protected from the weather. The horses are hardworking and love apples. The carriage has AC 11 and 75 hit points, and moves at the speed of its [draft horses](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/draft-horse.md) (40 feet). Four passengers can ride inside, two up front with one steering, and two atop the rear cargo area. Up to three people can also sit on the roof of the cabin, for an especially exciting perch when the cart is moving quickly!

Because this sort of franchise typically can't hold the characters and all their staff (at least not comfortably), such staff are often itinerant or based in whatever settlement the carriage returns to most often.

![The &quot;C&quot; Team's Wagon Headquarters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/005-02-04.webp#center)

#### Cosmetic Features

A cosmetic improvement, gained at franchise rank 2, allows a franchise to radically alter the look and feel of its headquarters. A beat-up wagon could become a gilded carriage, with luxurious interiors and servants dressed in matching finery. A tavern could proudly display the party's kills in the drinking hall, feature mugs gathered from dwarven holds around Faerûn, and have decor matching a particular theme.

Improvements can also be of a fantastic or magical nature, such as flickering magical torches or portraits that watch and interact with observers. The DM has final approval over such improvements, and is the arbiter as to whether cosmetic improvements might provide any actual benefits during play. When allowed, such benefits should be situational and limited. A foe might become distracted the first time a ghostly figure appears in a haunted tavern, but the quality of the illusion is such that it doesn't stand up to continued scrutiny.

Cosmetic effects can also be focused on selling and branding a franchise, such as adding manufacturing capabilities, a light-up sign, a customer showroom or service center, and other commercial features. At the DM's discretion, such features might generate additional income or lower the costs of certain franchise tasks.

##### Draconic Ship

This once-innocuous seagoing vessel has been detailed to appear as a brass dragon. The ship's interior is decorated in draconic art, and platforms among the rigging are linked by silk ropes attached to pulleys. These might provide benefits to crew trained in their use if the ship is ever attacked.

##### Enchanted Wizard's Tower

In the entrance hall of a former-wizard's-tower headquarters, enchanted portraits display visages of the franchise's recently vanquished foes. Smaller portraits throughout the tower display important moments in the franchise's adventuring history, and the whole interior is set with magical lighting, decorated with candelabra, and features drapes and carpets matching the franchise's chosen motif.

#### Expansion Features

At rank 2, an expansion feature allows a franchise to double the size of its headquarters. When doing so, players and characters can define the changes to the current configuration. Perhaps the headquarters expands in size laterally, or gains an extra floor. Perhaps a new basement is excavated—or poking around the existing basement reveals a secret level of dungeons heretofore unknown.

Franchise members can decide on what features are involved in the expansion, including new windows, doors, and furniture. Adding certain types of space might also call for extra supporting features. If storage is on an upper floor, a winch might be installed to lift goods. A cellar could add another exit and an area for storing wine or alchemical supplies. Or a carriage headquarters could gain a second cart to become a wagon train.

All construction is low cost but functional, as in the following examples.

##### Expanded Lighthouse

The lighthouse is now taller, with two additional levels, an upgraded beacon, and a stronger exterior. A stairway leads down into a network of old caverns, including some used as storage space, and finally onto a small beach with a dock.

##### Expanded Tavern

The building adjacent to the tavern has been bought out and connected to it, allowing for more guest chambers, a larger common room, a larger kitchen, and staff quarters. A large fireplace fills the common room with light and warmth, while new tables and chairs create a welcome environment. Guest chambers might feature a patio or balcony.

#### Transportation Features

Also at rank 2, every franchise gains some form of mobility, with players and DM working together to determine how a headquarters facilitates travel (or expands on its normal travel modes) from one location to another. A ship might gain a magic sail, or could add a balloon to become a battle balloon airship. A hollow statue could gain the ability to stride across the landscape. A wizard's tower might teleport from place to place. Or doors within a tavern could be revealed as a magical portal connected to various locations in far-flung lands.

The DM has final approval over the method of locomotion, and can put in place any reasonable limitations or constraints on that movement. Additionally, any method of movement should have a weakness or drawback determined by the DM. As a rule of thumb, a mobile headquarters can travel a distance of 30 miles per day (equivalent to a fast travel pace) per franchise rank. This rate of travel can vary depending on weather, visibility, availability of maps, or other conditions.

##### Giant Stone Statue

A 100-foot-tall stone statue has stairs and rooms carved within its interior. When a character sits at the helm located in a room within the statue's head, the statue can be directed to walk across the land. The statue ignores difficult terrain, usually by simply crashing through it. However, the navigator has a limited sight line while peering out through the statue's large eyes. When the terrain is cluttered or subject to combat conditions, it can be hard to avoid creatures or objects smaller than a large building.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Donaar Blit'zen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/donaar-blitzen-ai.md)  
> 
> A good idea is to swim in the wake of an existing business. Somebody else did the market research and decided this was a good location? Awesome! Now use that decision against them. Set up direct competition. Then spread rumors about them until they're forced to leave the area in shame. Now the market is yours. That's how you business.

##### Battle Balloon

A hot air balloon is lit by a magic furnace channeling elemental power. A galleon suspended below the balloon features a helm that controls the ship. The vessel can fly virtually anywhere, ignoring difficult terrain, but it is at risk from storms and strong winds. If the balloon takes significant damage, the ship could be forced to descend—or might even crash.

("Appendix C" features vehicle statistics for a typical battle balloon. For characters who choose this highly coveted feature for their headquarters, the DM can impose limitations on the ship's attacks and make changes to its statistics.)

##### Self-Contained Train

This mobile franchise headquarters features a magical-mechanical locomotive that lays down its own track. Mechanical arms at the front of the locomotive set down crossbars and rails in front of the headquarters at ridiculous speed, while arms at the back of the headquarters pick up the track as it passes. The train moves at quarter speed over difficult terrain (instead of half speed). It can pass over rivers, but cannot cross lakes or large bodies of water.

##### Extradimensional Wagon

A seemingly simple wagon drawn by an old horse channels powerful magic. The wagon's driver can cause the wagon to teleport the distance of a day's journey, targeting a known location over the course of one or more extradimensional jumps. Such teleportation is usually done when no one is looking, to avoid arousing suspicion or frightening the locals. Though the wagon eventually arrives at the intended destination, the intervening stop-off points are unknown—and quite possibly perilous.

> [!note] Acquisitions Incorporated Is Magic!
> 
> Dungeons & Dragons offers a wide range of play styles, and works with many different types of campaign story. The "Dungeon Master's Guide" talks about some of the most common types of fantasy that can shape a D&D campaign, including a general sense of campaigns being high magic, low magic, or the D&D standard in between.
> 
> An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has its own distinct feel, as talked about in "chapter 1" of this book. Part of that feel comes from the substantial benefits that characters gain from franchise features and company positions—mechanical boons, magic items, access to powerful spell effects, and more. These benefits are gained automatically, as a general reward for the characters' adventuring success driving franchise advancement. So it's important that everyone is aware how adding those built-in campaign benefits to the regular magic gained during adventuring will give the characters a boost in power.
> 
> For an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign meant to feel and play like standard D&D, the DM should consider creating a low-magic campaign, and letting the benefits of company positions and franchise features fill in the magical gaps. A standard campaign played with the rules in this book should be treated as a high magic campaign, with the DM and the players understanding that the difficulty of encounters and other tasks might need to be ramped up to offer a real challenge to the characters. Of course, nothing prevents anyone from playing a high magic campaign with the Acquisitions Incorporated rules. But DMs and players should all be aware that doing so will create extremely powerful characters—who will no doubt attract extremely powerful enemies and threats as a matter of course.
^acquisitions-incorporated-is-magic

#### Weapon Features

At rank 2, the members of a franchise can add a weapon to their headquarters, choosing from the options in the ""Siege Equipment"" section of chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". The DM can limit those options or change the details of specific choices, and players can also design unique offensive features, subject to approval by the DM. For example, a walking statue that strikes with a fist could be treated as a ram—or the DM and the players might agree that it would be fun to use some of the effects of [Bigby's hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bigbys-hand.md) for such an attack.

Most siege weapons (whether mechanical or magical) require two characters, crew, or skilled hirelings to operate, and such weapons might be slow to reload or recharge. Headquarters weapons are not particularly effective against small bands of creatures (such as a group of goblins), but they can be useful against a single large threat (such as a dragon). If siege weapons are abused by franchisees, they might be targeted by enemies, break down, or require costly maintenance each time they are employed in battle.

##### Giant Statue's Fists

A giant hollow metal statue acting as a franchise headquarters features a control center from which the statue's arms can be manipulated. One fist can be used per round to strike at foes, using statistics similar to a ram (AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).

##### Giant Fist

*Melee Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one object or creature. *Hit*: 16 (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage.

##### Lighthouse Energy Blast

Magical power can be focused through a lighthouse beacon, requiring 1 round to gather energy and aim. The following round, the energy can be released. The beacon has AC 12, 75 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to cold. The explosion of energy can be treated as a [scorching ray](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scorching-ray.md), [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md), or [lightning bolt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lightning-bolt.md) spell, as the DM determines. More powerful features might require more time to recharge, or could be usable only a certain number of times per day. Such attacks might function at longer range but be unable to target creatures or objects within 60 feet of the lighthouse.

#### Arcane Features

At rank 3, an arcane feature provides a unique magical capability to a headquarters. A haunted headquarters might gain a permanent cohort of friendly undead servants, while a giant statue headquarters could gain the ability to allow the characters to see at great distances and through darkness or fog. A more generic arcane feature could instead grant any franchisee the ability to cast a specific spell of 6th level or lower, with a limitation of one casting per day.

An arcane feature should be something that doesn't fit within another category (specifically, a transportation or weapon feature), though the DM is the final judge of what arcane features are acceptable.

> 
> Money is an attempt to discretize the ephemeral—an impossible task. When Head Office comes knocking, tell them that money is an attempt to discretize the ephemeral.

##### Ever-Changing Ship

Whether an oceangoing vessel or an airship, this headquarters can alter its appearance with illusion magic. Additionally, the appearance of some or all creatures aboard can be changed as if they were affected by a [seeming](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/seeming.md) spell. Franchisees can alter the appearance of the ship and its occupants a number of times per day, or can drop the illusory effects as needs be. The nature of the illusion magic means that the ship's size and features do not change, and individuals interacting with the ship or investigating its appearance have a chance to see the true form of the ship and its crew.

##### Spectral Wait Staff

A tavern headquarters (which already has a cosmetic feature to make it appear haunted) now gains spectral wait staff. The spectral staff serve customers expertly, and speak and understand speech as if intelligent. However, they are magical creations similar to those conjured by the [unseen servant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/unseen-servant.md) spell, able to perform all the functions of such a creation and any other functions agreed to by the DM. Spectral staff can momentarily become insubstantial, along with anything they carry, allowing them to serve food and drink through walls. Any member of the franchise can spend an action to telepathically command one or more spectral staff members.

#### Defensive Features

Also at rank 3, the headquarters gains one defensive feature, planned out by the players in collaboration with the DM. Ships and other vessels with statistics can gain an increase to hit points or AC. Or a general defensive feature could include the choice of any two effects noted in the [guards and wards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guards-and-wards.md) spell, which can be enabled or disabled by any franchise member.

Players are encouraged to be creative in thinking about defensive features. An airship might have a deck that can channel lightning to repel boarders. A wagon might have transparent windows as strong as steel, and the ability to retract any rails or platforms upon which attacking foes could stand. Defensive features might impose conditions on enemies, or even deal damage. The DM should limit damaging effects to dealing 10 damage to a single target (5 damage for a multitarget or area effect) per franchise rank. When a saving throw is required, a good DC is 12 + franchise rank.

##### Carriage Ejector Platforms

A carriage gains potent defensive capabilities in the form of sections of its roof and walls set with powerful concealed springs. This defensive feature can be activated as a bonus action by the driver or any creature within 5 feet of them. When a creature steps or grabs onto a protected section, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be flung from the wagon to a distance of 10 feet per franchise rank. The creature takes falling damage as if it had fallen that distance.

##### Electrified Floors and Rails

Specific areas of a ship or airship's floor and railings are warded with elemental lightning, up to an area the size of half the ship's upper deck. A character at the helm can activate this magic as a bonus action. Any creature making contact with a warded area takes 13 (`3d8`) lightning damage, and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

##### Grease Compartment

Whether a building, a vessel, or some other structure, a franchise is equipped with a compartment holding grease. When activated, nozzles release the grease either in a 30-foot cone or into a specific area no larger than 20 by 20 feet—typically focusing on an area through which attacking creatures are likely to move. Any creature entering the greased area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and end its movement that turn. A creature driving a vehicle that enters the greased area must make an appropriate ability check against the save DC. On a failure, the vehicle veers `3d10 + 10` feet in a random direction, then ends its movement for the round.

#### Franchise Choice Features

At ranks 3 and 4, a franchise can outfit its headquarters with any one feature from among the lower-tier features (cosmetic, expansion, transportation, or weapon features). In consultation with the DM, this might cover additional features to augment the headquarters' existing look or combat capability, or a plan to instead make an existing feature even stronger. A method of transportation might double its speed and remove an existing drawback, or an offensive feature could deal more damage or target more than one creature per round.

#### Secret Features

A secret feature, gained at rank 4, is one that remains unnoticed to most inspection, typically requiring a successful DC 25 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check or Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice. A headquarters might have a secret exit that guarantees escape and allows franchise members or staff to leave and enter without detection. A secret feature should usually add in-game benefits, such as a potion-brewing laboratory in a secret level of a castle, or a secret cargo hold within a ship that can keep perishables fresh and provide endless stocks of food and water to crew and passengers.

##### Escape Pod

A walking statue's head can also serve as an escape pod. If the headquarters is ever destroyed, or if the character controlling the statue activates the escape mode as an action, the head detaches from the body and takes to the air with a flying speed of 80 feet. The flight lasts for up to 5 rounds, and is directed by the same controls that originally controlled the statue. If the head is not on the ground when the flight ends, it falls and any creatures within take falling damage.

##### Extradimensional Tavern

Several of the doors in a franchise's tavern are inscribed with runes. Anyone who traces a rune while speaking a passphrase can access their choice of ten extradimensional rooms, 20 feet on a side. These rooms can function as libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, kitchens, prisons, private quarters, and more, with each room's setup and contents chosen when the rooms are first installed. Each room's initial furnishing and equipment are included, though characters can later add to these features as they wish.

##### Glider Launcher

A hidden compartment within an airship holds ten gliders. A secret door leads to the compartment, which features an exterior escape hatch activated from within any glider. Each glider accommodates one Medium or smaller creature and up to 50 pounds of gear, has a flying speed of 60 feet, and must descend at least 20 feet each round. A glider can be piloted as an action by any character with proficiency with flying vehicles. Characters without such proficiency might need to make ability checks of the DM's choosing to pilot a glider successfully. A glider weighs 100 pounds, has AC 14, 50 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage.

### Franchise Costs

Running an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise offers countless benefits to an adventuring party—but those benefits aren't cheap. Operating the franchise, installing and maintaining franchise features, paying staff, creating merchandise with proper branding, settling legal issues, and more are all encompassed by the baseline cost for a franchise's headquarters, a multiplier from the franchise's rank, and the franchise party's business performance for the month.

If a franchise's costs leave a party low on cash, that's a sign that it's time to go adventuring. Alternatively, characters might use downtime to structure a leaner business or engage in non-adventuring activities to bring in more gold (see ""Franchise Tasks and Downtime"" later in this chapter for more information). A franchise's majordomo handles these finances and makes all necessary payments to Head Office, suppliers, and other agents—as long as sufficient funds are available.

#### Baseline Costs

The baseline monthly cost of a franchise is calculated based on the franchise's headquarters, as noted on the Baseline Costs table on the next page. The costs on this table differ from the costs found in the ""Recurring Expenses"" section of chapter 6 in the "Dungeon Master's Guide". (That section details the costs characters might expect to pay to own an inn, a keep, or other types of properties.) This is because franchise costs include a tithe to Head Office, repayment to Acquisitions Incorporated for funding the initial construction or purchase of the headquarters, the use of approved contractors for construction and maintenance, and other subtle fees.

Baseline costs are for representative dwellings, and can be adjusted by the DM as needs be. A noble estate that is the envy of other nobles might demand expenditures of double or triple the baseline cost. A franchise's baseline costs might also change during the course of the campaign. A party might initially start out headquartered in an abandoned lighthouse with monthly expenses of 250 gp. But as time passes and headquarters features are added, that lighthouse might grow in size, weapon features, and magic to resemble a fortified tower. The DM will modify baseline costs as needed to fit the headquarters and the campaign style.

![Baseline Costs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/baseline-costs-ai.md)

Some characters might decide to maintain more than one headquarters for their franchise, or to control additional sites as part of the franchise's overall operation. A franchise might use a ship as its headquarters, while also owning a number of remote trading posts run by franchise staff. The costs for all such "virtual headquarters" should be added together to derive one monthly baseline cost.

#### Franchise Rank Multiplier

The multiplier on the Franchise Advancement table is applied to a franchise's baseline cost. This represents the increased costs a franchise faces as it expands into larger markets.

#### Monthly Business Performance

Each month, a franchise performs the running a franchise task, which can be found in the ""Franchise Tasks and Downtime"" section later in this chapter. The result of this task is used to calculate the final monthly cost, and is deducted from the franchise's coffers.

#### Defaulting

No self-respecting franchise would ever run out of money and fail to make its monthly payments. Right? Were that to happen, the amount owed—plus a modest 15 percent penalty—would be due to Head Office the following month. Failing to make payments—and especially defaulting on two or more payments in a row—is likely to trigger campaign consequences. Head Office might send inspectors to a troubled franchise, or assign the franchisees a difficult (and hopefully profitable) mission. Rival groups and entrepreneurs might smell blood and attempt to attack the franchise or take over its markets. Nefarious NPCs will most certainly come calling.

Defaulting on franchise payments can also strain relationships with nobles, merchants, and others who value a franchise more for its assets than for the characters. Such relationships typically turn frosty until the characters are able to prove that the franchise is back on its feet.

## Company Positions

A franchise is a complex affair, requiring its participants to fulfill a myriad of important duties necessary for its proper growth (and the enrichment of Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office). A company position establishes a character's role within a franchise, as well as a relationship with the larger Acq Inc organization.

When you choose a company position for your character, that choice is independent of and in addition to your character's background, class, and other options. Though Head Office might tell would-be Acq Inc franchisees to play to their strengths, you should choose the position that speaks to you—and that feels like it'll be the most fun. All characters who take on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise must take a company position. A character can take only one position within a franchise.

Each company position has its own distinct flavor—and comes with a range of preternatural benefits. Some of these benefits take the form of material boons granted by Head Office, including specialized magic items available only to Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees. Others are shaped by the subtle power of your position and the franchise's rank.

### Joint Effort

Players—and especially new players—should keep in mind the amount of creativity and collaboration a company position requires when determining which position is the best fit for their character. In addition to their various mechanical benefits, the features of each company position are intended to offer players and DMs the opportunity to collaborate on crafting campaign narrative. Sometimes this is straightforward, as when a feature allows a character to learn useful information about enemies or allies, as with the obviator's Read the Opposition feature. Sometimes this calls for a focused collaborative effort between player and DM, as with the cartographer's Tale of Safe Travel. Where the narrative options in a position's features lend themselves to interpretation, the DM works with the players to determine how those options play out, as is the baseline model of every Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.

### Position Proficiencies

Accepting a company position with Acquisitions Incorporated means more than just a title and hopes of a paycheck. With it comes access to trade secrets, best practices, and corporate shortcuts central to fulfilling one's role within a franchise. When a character takes a specific company position, they gain proficiency in the tools and skills associated with that position. Such proficiency also extends to a variety of business practices, day-to-day tasks, and hazard mitigations that are all part of the job. Professional functions that characters can add their proficiency bonus to are detailed in the "Position Proficiency" section of each of the following company positions.

> [!note] Company Tools
> 
> The tools and items that are granted to a character as part of a company position are unique objects created and bestowed by Head Office on trusted franchisees. A set of Acquisitions Incorporated tools might resemble mundane tools, but they are never the same. Countless mundane cartographers in the world have proficiency with cartographer's tools. But only an Acquisitions Incorporated cartographer has access to a [cartographer's map case](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-map-case-ai.md) and the ability to use it.
> 
> Magic items gained as part of a company position always require attunement, but they do not count against the number of magic items a character can normally attune to. Each item can be attuned to only by the character to whom it has been granted by Head Office. If the tools of other Acq Inc franchisees are ever found, they cannot be attuned even by characters with the applicable position. (It goes without saying that such tools found at large are expected to be returned to Head Office immediately.)
> 
> Each position magic item is representative of the significant mystic expertise of Acquisitions Incorporated—and no matter who might use them, position items always belong to the franchise proper. The use of such items is typically revoked upon leaving the company, and Head Office is known for the diligence with which it retrieves items that are "accidentally" held onto.

### Gaining Ranks

You choose your character's position when the character first joins an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Your character's position rank is equal to your franchise's rank. Starting from rank 1, you gain specialized training (including new proficiencies), special equipment, and your rank 1 position feature. Then, as the franchise grows, the scope of your position grows with it. Each time the franchise gains a rank (normally at levels 5, 11, and 17), your character is promoted to that new rank in their position and gains the appropriate benefits.

### Cartographer

> [!quote]- A quote from Cartographer's boast  
> 
> *I've seen a million places, and I've mapped them all*!

Acquisitions Incorporated missions can lead across vast tracts of wilderness, into ancient ruins, deep underground, or to even more dangerous and remote places. The cartographer selects the method and route of travel for a franchise, and creates and maintains maps of the journey. As the characters travel, the cartographer maps important locations and resources, later providing finished maps to Head Office. The franchise's cartographer is also often responsible for the selection and care of vehicles and mounts.

As a cartographer, you have a sharp eye for detail and take an interest in people, history, and natural features. You help advance your franchise by discovering and mapping new locations or hidden features, acquiring rare maps, and using different modes of transportation in secure and clever ways.

**Noteworthy Cartographers**: [Rosie Beestinger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rosie-beestinger-ai.md) ("C" Team), [Brahma Lutier](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/brahma-lutier-ai.md) ("B" Team, retired), [Pendragon Beestinger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/pendragon-beestinger-ai.md) ("B" Team), Purnagh Grost

**Essential Functions**: Create and maintain maps of a franchise's journeys; dictate directions

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus when you make an ability check to create or examine maps, search for new paths in the wild, or assess a route for possible dangers.

![The Cartographer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-cartographer-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 cartographer, you gain proficiency with [cartographer's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-tools.md), and your choice of vehicles (land) or vehicles (water).

Head Office also grants you the use of cartographer's supplies (quill, ink, parchment, a pair of compasses, calipers, and a ruler), a waterproof leather map case, a spyglass, and a supply of colored inks.

#### It's a Rental

At rank 1, at the start of any mission, you can requisition a second-hand [draft horse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/draft-horse.md) and [cart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cart.md) (barely functional), [riding horses](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md) and [ponies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/pony.md) (typically well aged, one for each party member), passage on a ship or ferry (might require minor labor as part of the fare), and similar transportation. Any damage or losses to requisitioned equipment is expected to be repaid to Head Office.

#### Spyglass of Clairvoyance

At rank 2, your Head Office-supplied spyglass becomes a common magic item. As an action, you can look through the [spyglass of clairvoyance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spyglass-of-clairvoyance-ai.md) at a location within 1 mile of you that is obstructing your view, such as a mountain, castle, or forest. You must then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom check using [cartographer's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-tools.md) to map the natural terrain found within three miles of that chosen point. You do not gain any knowledge of creatures, structures, or anything other than natural terrain. This property of the spyglass cannot be used again until the next dawn.

#### Tale of Safe Travel

Starting at rank 2, you gain the ability to perform a 45-minute ritual using your [cartographer's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-tools.md), maps, and 50 gp in consumed material components. By doing so, you ensure safe travel for you and other creatures, from your current location to another location you could normally reach within one day. The destination must be one to which you have traveled previously, or for which you have an accurate route and map.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/006-02-05.webp#center)

If your tale is told with reverence and precision, you and up to six other creatures plus their gear (including vehicles or mounts) become encircled in a magical bubble and are pulled into the "Border Ethereal" (see chapter 2 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). During the ritual, you tell a story of your future journey, relating details of what will be seen en route. The DM can choose to add to the story, imparting additional details or planting seeds for future adventures. If you wish, the ritual can be ended early, allowing the party to encounter what's being described by the DM.

Whenever the ritual is ended or interrupted by you, all the travelers arrive safely at the destination. At the DM's discretion, all the travelers affected by the ritual can gain the benefit of either a short rest or a long rest during the voyage.

#### Map of Shortcuts

At rank 3, your map case becomes a common magic item. In addition to storing normal maps, your [cartographer's map case](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-map-case-ai.md) can be used to generate a special map identifying a shortcut. You can use your action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, with a success revealing a map buried in your *cartographer's map case* noting a relevant shortcut . Your travel time is reduced by half while you follow that route. If you succeed at the check by 5 or more, the map includes notes on the terrain, granting you advantage on the next ability check you make to travel through the mapped area in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

Determined to avoid this in future, he began leaving trails of things behind him—trails he would often find again later, or intersect with at odd angles. Imagine his relief when he discovered maps. Grost was not born a cartographer, but that hasn't kept him from reaching the apex of the profession.

^half-orc-cartographer-fighter

#### Map of the Moment

Starting at rank 3, you can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check and search your [cartographer's map case](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-map-case-ai.md) to find a map either related to your current mission or inspiring a new one. On a success, you find a map with a prominent landmark. The map has information on the natural terrain within one mile of the landmark. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later.

![Map of the Moment; Possible Map Mission Landmarks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/map-of-the-moment-possible-map-mission-landmarks-ai.md)

#### Elder Cartographer's Glossography

When you attain rank 4, you gain a small tome that is an uncommon magic item. The [elder cartographer's glossography](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/elder-cartographers-glossography-ai.md) grants advantage on Intelligence or Wisdom checks related to geographical features or locations.

![Cartographer's Map Case](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/007-02-06.webp#center)

#### Greater Tale of Safe Travel

Also at rank 4, your Tale of Safe Travel feature can now span up to three days of travel. If your franchise headquarters is mobile, you can include it in your Tale of Safe Travel, and can also include items or goods weighing up to 2,000 pounds.

![Why Be a Cartographer?](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/why-be-a-cartographer-ai.md)

### Decisionist

> [!quote]- A quote from Decisionist sales pitch  
> 
> *I'm not saying there aren't other perspectives. Just that my perspective is the only one that's on-brand*.

A decisionist brings decisive leadership to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. They settle disputes and ensure that the team moves forward toward its goals, often serving as a leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call for a vote. The results of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office. Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the franchise work together effectively.

All decisionists vary in their approach to the task. You might primarily attempt to convince others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who've done the things you haven't quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the best-selling *Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties* and *I Don't Care If the Rogue Stole Your Coins, We Have a Job to Do*. You help advance the franchise by calling for votes, making sure you're always on the side with the most votes, and resolving disputes within the franchise party.

**Noteworthy Decisionists**: [Donaar Blit'zen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/donaar-blitzen-ai.md) ("C" Team), Kelshi Annab

**Essential Functions**: Receive one extra vote on franchise matters; resolve interparty conflicts

**Position Proficiencies**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to influence a decision being made by a group, assess the popularity of certain customs or individuals, or boost the morale of franchise hirelings.

> [!quote]-  
> 
> There are decisionists of all stripes. Domineering narcissists gravitate toward the role, to be sure, and occasionally that unyielding demeanor has its purpose. Decisionist Annab approaches the role in another way, considering herself in many ways outside the party she travels with, even though she has served in this capacity for years. When she leverages her *coin of decisionry*, glinting with its final, unswerving resolve, it is because she has heard all.

![Decisionist; The Decisonist](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/decisionist-the-decisonist-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 decisionist, you gain proficiency with a musical instrument (horn).

Head office also grants you the use of a musical instrument (your choice of [horn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/horn.md)), a voting kit (ballots, a ballot box, an "I Voted" sticker set), and a [coin of decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md). This large gold coin is emblazoned with the sigil of Acquisitions Incorporated as "heads," and has a "tails" image that varies.

![Proficiencies and Starting Equipment; Coin of Decisionry "Tails" Image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/proficiencies-and-starting-equipment-coin-of-decisionry-tails-image-ai.md)

#### Tiebreaker

Starting at rank 1, whenever the members of your franchise take a vote, you can present your [coin of decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md) and cast two votes.

#### Absentee Ballot

Starting at rank 2, if a member of your franchise party is absent, you gain their vote and can decide quite confidently how they would have voted. In addition, if a vote is ever taken while you are absent, you can call for a recount and add your two votes to the final voting result.

#### Coin of Decisionry

Starting at rank 2, your [coin of decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md) becomes a common magic item. When you flip the coin, it always lands with the Acquisitions Incorporated sigil face down, and a message appears on the "tails" face. Roll a `d4` on the following table to determine the message.

![Coin of Decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md)

The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can detect your manipulation with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

#### Better Odds

When you reach rank 3, your [coin of decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md) gains a measure of actual divination power and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal function, you can use an action to flip the [coin of decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md) twice while pondering a specific plan or objective, noting both random results. If you succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, you learn which of the two results is more applicable to the course of action. This property of the coin can't be used again until the next dawn.

![Coin Of Decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/009-02-08.webp#center)

#### Inspired Decision

Starting at rank 3, whenever a serious franchise vote is taken and the result goes the way you voted, you can inspire the rest of the franchise team with a brief speech. Make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a success, each franchise member of your choice who can hear you gains advantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Charming Misdemeanor

As a rank 4 decisionist, you can present your [coin of decisionry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/coin-of-decisionry-ai.md) to grant yourself an extra vote when your franchise votes, for a total of three votes. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until dawn seven days later.

#### Clandestine Kit

At rank 4, your [voting kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/voting-kit-ai.md) becomes a common magic item that conceals an extradimensional space. As a bonus action, you can place one tool kit that you are proficient with into the *voting kit*, or can remove it. No other type of object can be placed into the extradimensional space. A creature searching the *voting kit* finds and extracts the tool kit with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

Additionally, you can use the [voting kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/voting-kit-ai.md) to cast [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md) (save DC 15). This property of the kit can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Documancer

> [!quote]- A quote from Documancer's warning  
> 
> *Contracts have mystical power. Break my contract and I'll use your bones for my next quill*.

Every great Acquisitions Incorporated quest begins with a contract from Head Office—and a franchise's documancer is most likely the one who controls and channels the power of that contract. A documancer bears the responsibility of managing each of a franchise's quests, of ensuring that every condition of the quest is fulfilled, and of recording and sending on information vital to Head Office when the mission is complete. When creating contracts with other organizations, a documancer makes sure that the language benefits both the franchise and Acquisitions Incorporated.

As a documancer, you are respected for having the commitment and mental fortitude required to work with Head Office. You advance your franchise by using documancy for communication, insisting on recording all deals in writing, retaining records, destroying other records, and recalling vital information.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Walnut Dankgrass](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/walnut-dankgrass-ai.md)

**Essential Functions**: Record information; track job and quest details within the franchise

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to organize lore, analyze official or arcane documents, or convey a legally binding point of view.

In time, this hunger to define and make official the rhythm of daily life found its expression in documancy, a kind of mystic bureaucratic art founded by [Omin Dran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md). Anything you put a signature to has power. And Brynshal wields that power with ease.

![The Documancer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-documancer-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 documancer, you gain proficiency with [calligrapher's supplies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/calligraphers-supplies.md).

Head office also grants you the use of [calligrapher's supplies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/calligraphers-supplies.md) (ink, a dozen sheets of parchment, and three quills), a [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md) for your calligrapher's supplies, a ledger, [sealing wax](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sealing-wax.md), copper and silver leaf, a documancer's seal of limited authority, and a [scroll case](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/map-or-scroll-case.md).

#### Gift of Words

At rank 1, you are fluent in the semi-arcane language of documancy. This knowledge grants you advantage on Intelligence checks to decipher codes or similar scripts. The DM might also provide you with hints whenever you try to solve a puzzle or decipher clues involving writing.

#### Documancy Satchel

At rank 2, your [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md) becomes a common magic item, allowing you to magically send and receive documents to and from Head Office through a special pouch. Your [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md) magically produces prewritten and signature-ready contracts at your request, covering most common contractual needs. It also occasionally produces sticky notes printed with useful information and inspirational quotes from Head Office.

#### Fluent in Boss

Also at rank 2, your documancer training allows you to better process Head Office communications, as well as to understand what pleases your superiors. You can cast the [augury](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md) spell, with the spell's omens of weal or woe based solely on the perspective of Head Office. (It should be noted that Head Office at times has a surprisingly high disregard for potential woe to its employees.) Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later.

#### Satchel of Holding

At rank 3, your [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md) gains additional features and becomes an uncommon magic item. One of the satchel's pouches now functions as a [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md).

Additionally, you can use an action to draw forth from the [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md) a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md). The scroll vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it appears. This property of the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Document Flexibility

Also at rank 3, you gain proficiency with a [forgery kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/forgery-kit.md). One such kit (containing several different types of ink, a variety of parchments and papers, several quills, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and small tools to sculpt melted wax to mimic a seal) is always contained within the extradimensional space of your [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md).

![Documancy Satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/011-02-10.webp#center)

#### Scroll Humidor

At rank 4, your [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md) gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. Within the satchel, a dedicated extradimensional space can hold up to thirty documents or [spell scrolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md). Placing a single document into the scroll humidor is an action. Drawing forth a desired scroll is a bonus action.

#### Scroll Service

Also at rank 4, you can use an action to request one [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) containing a spell of up to 3rd level from Head Office. If you succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, the scroll instantly appears within your [documancy satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/documancy-satchel-ai.md). Only you can use this scroll. The scroll vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it has been summoned. After a successful use, this property of the satchel can't be used again until dawn seven days later. If you failed the check, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

![Why Be a Documancer?](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/why-be-a-documancer-ai.md)

### Hoardsperson

> [!quote]- A quote from Hoardsperson joke (not joking)  
> 
> *Disbursement of coin is at my discretion. Be really nice to me*.

As the name suggests, Acquisitions Incorporated is all about the acquiring, and the hoardsperson's job is all about storing that hard-earned loot. Each hoardsperson plays the vital role of managing a franchise's resources—including the inventory of all supplies used and treasure gained during an adventure. Hoardspersons pay particular attention to making sure that supplies are requisitioned through Acquisitions Incorporated-approved sources whenever possible, and ensuring that the proper selection of loot is sent to Head Office at the end of a mission.

As a hoardsperson, you are known as a trustworthy and responsible individual. You support your franchise by demonstrating accuracy, avoiding shortfalls, and anticipating resource needs.

**Noteworthy Hoardspersons**: [K'thriss Drow'b](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kthriss-drowb-ai.md) ("C" Team), [Phoenix Anvil](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/phoenix-anvil-ai.md) ("B" Team), Two Dry Cloaks

**Essential Functions**: Manage stores and items; track resources

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to negotiate a price for goods and services, assess the quality of equipment and treasure, or analyze resources in a local area.

![The Hoardsperson](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-hoardsperson-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 hoardsperson, you gain proficiency with jeweler's tools.

Head office also grants you the use of [jeweler's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewelers-tools.md) (a small saw and hammer, files, pliers, and tweezers) and an account ledger, as well as up to 5 gp worth of equipment from the following options: [barrel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/barrel.md), [basket](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/basket.md), [block and tackle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/block-and-tackle.md), [bucket](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bucket.md), [chest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chest.md), [flask or tankard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tankard.md), [jug or pitcher](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jug.md), [iron pot](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iron-pot.md), [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md), [sack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sack.md), [saddlebags](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/saddlebags.md), [vial](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/vial.md), and [waterskin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/waterskin.md).

#### What a Deal

Also at rank 1, you can use your extensive supply network to buy one item found on any table in the ""Mounts and Vehicles"" or ""Trade Goods"" sections in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook" and have it delivered to your franchise headquarters within one day. With a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, you also negotiate a 50 percent discount on the item.

If you fail the check, you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest. When you use this feature successfully twice, you cannot use it again until your franchise attains the next rank.

^tabaxi-hoardsperson-rogue

#### Living Loot Satchel

As a rank 2 hoardsperson, you are granted the use of a [living loot satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/living-loot-satchel-ai.md), which is an uncommon magic item. It functions as a [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) and is available in a variety of colors and styles.

![Class-Based Living Loot Satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/class-based-living-loot-satchel-ai.md)

![Living Loot Satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/013-02-12.webp#center)

The [living loot satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/living-loot-satchel-ai.md) is a kind of magical being that safeguards the franchise's funds and valuables. Its innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office's vault in Waterdeep, to which the satchel periodically transfers the franchise's wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back to your satchel with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

#### Living the Good Life

Also at rank 2, Head Office trusts that as long as your needs are met, you have no reason to skim any profits. You maintain a wealthy lifestyle at no cost to you.

#### Secret Satchel

As a rank 3 hoardsperson, your [living loot satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/living-loot-satchel-ai.md) gets an upgrade to function as the replica chest used for the [Leomund's secret chest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/leomunds-secret-chest.md) spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can open the secret chest through your [living loot satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/living-loot-satchel-ai.md) to deposit or withdraw items—even items that wouldn't normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head Office striking deals you don't want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don't want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end.

#### That Thing You Need

At rank 3, you can use a bonus action to reach into your [living loot satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/living-loot-satchel-ai.md) and make a DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on the "Adventuring Gear" table in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook". The item must be of a size that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15 gp. Once you attempt to draw five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn.

#### Portable Hole Satchel

At rank 4, your [living loot satchel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/living-loot-satchel-ai.md) receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic item. The secret chest accessed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a [portable hole](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portable-hole.md)—6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized object into the *portable-hole*-sized chest, even if it wouldn't normally fit into your satchel.

> [!quote]- A quote from [K'thriss Drow'b](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kthriss-drowb-ai.md)  
> 
> The key to the hoardsperson's job is cataloging all goods that enter the party's possession. You may also catalog goods that do not belong to the party. Sometimes it works.

#### That Expensive Thing You Need

Also at rank 4, when you use your That Thing You Need feature, you can requisition any item of up to 250 gp in value, as long as it would fit into the confines of your satchel's [portable hole](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portable-hole.md).

![Why Be a Hoardsperson?](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/why-be-a-hoardsperson-ai.md)

### Loremonger

> [!quote]- A quote from Loremonger mantra  
> 
> *I never forget a detail... though many wish I would*.

Information has value, and the loremonger is that information's keeper. A franchise's loremonger studies and records all lore relevant to its operation, including tracking the economic, technical, and arcane methods by which the franchise can be improved. A loremonger records the deeds and history of the franchise, including the names of places visited and people met during missions. Those records are then sent to Head Office (often through a franchise's documancer) to ensure brand integrity.

As a loremonger, you are a studious individual, usually with an interest in history or technical subjects. You might revel in your role, working as a central figure in your franchise as you use your knowledge to promote it. Or you might operate from the shadows, resembling a clever spymaster and allowing others to be the franchise's public face. You help advance your franchise by discovering secrets, tracking important lore gained during the characters' travels, and reporting on competitors' goals and methods.

**Noteworthy Loremongers**: Mabannok Kovri

**Essential Functions**: Record names, dates, and vital information

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to analyze the operation of a franchise, assess historical records, or decipher codes.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Omin Dran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md)  
> 
> Loremongers talk a lot. It's best to let them.

![The Loremonger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-loremonger-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 loremonger, you gain one of the following proficiencies of your choice: artisan's tools (choose type), [navigator's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/navigators-tools.md), vehicles (land), or vehicles (water).

Head office also grants you the use of an appropriate tool kit if you chose a tool proficiency, as well as ink and an ink pen.

#### Whisper Jar

Also at rank 1, you are the beneficiary of a [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md)—a common magic item resembling an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others' stories and your own observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The *whisper jar* records as fast as a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded. Activating the playback of a particular recording is an action.

![Things Recorded in Your Whisper Jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/things-recorded-in-your-whisper-jar-ai.md)

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/014-02-13.webp#center)

#### Need to Know

At rank 2, your insight grants you preternatural knowledge of the creatures around you. As an action, select one humanoid you can see and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a success, you learn the following information: the creature's name, up to three aliases it has used within the past month, its primary profession, and its skill proficiencies. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once on any creature.

#### Whispered Encyclopedia

At rank 2, your [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md) becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check. On a success, the jar plays back a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This property of the [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md) can't be used again until the next dawn.

> [!quote]-  
> 
> Even without a *whisper jar*, Mabannok Kovri is an incomparable trove of lore. With the jar—that misty, transparent urn that all loremongers use as a tool of their station—they can scoot close to omniscience. "Mab" decants their *whisper jar* to share and protect any information vital to the franchise. But they have a particular sideline hobby of greedily trapping ribald dwarven poetry and recipes that "honor the noble turnip."

^gnome-loremonger-druid

![Whisper Jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/015-02-14.webp#center)

#### Construction Permits

At rank 3, your knowledge of best practices for improving an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise results in a 20 percent reduction in your franchise's monthly costs (see ""Franchise Costs"" earlier in this chapter, and ""Franchise Tasks and Downtime"" later in this chapter).

In addition, choose one room in your franchise headquarters that belongs to you alone. That room gains one cosmetic feature, and the headquarters as a whole gains one secret feature over and above those gained normally through franchise advancement. See ""Headquarters Features"" earlier in this chapter for more information.

#### Whispered Warnings

Also at rank 3, your [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md) gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As an action, you can cause the jar to function as a [wand of enemy detection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-enemy-detection.md), whereupon it whispers the direction to foes within range. This property of the [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md) can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Efficient Upgrades

At rank 4, your knowledge of franchise lore and development yields further dividends. Your franchise headquarters gains one weapon feature and one cosmetic feature over and above those gained normally through franchise advancement. See ""Headquarters Features"" earlier in this chapter.

#### Whispered Arcana

Also at rank 4, your [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md) gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name of one of the following spells into the jar as an action, you can cast that spell from the jar: [detect evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect poison and disease](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md), [find traps](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-traps.md), [identify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md), or [locate animals or plants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-animals-or-plants.md). This property of the [whisper jar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whisper-jar-ai.md) can't be used again until the next dawn.

![Why Be a Loremonger?](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/why-be-a-loremonger-ai.md)

### Obviator

> [!quote]- A quote from Obviator creed  
> 
> *I adjust the odds and remove obstacles to create maximum convenience for our franchise*.

Obstacles abound along the path to riches. A franchise's mission success might require combating a rival organization's disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle's defenses the next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter what the type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise's obviator determines the optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It's just business.)

As an obviator, you hatch convoluted plots to fight the overwhelming odds presented by each mission—by whatever means are necessary. Sometimes, you might prefer brute strength and improvisation. Other times, you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases, though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating problems, and learning about your foes—ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to their own success.

**Noteworthy Obviators**: Lok

**Essential Functions**: Destroy targets (people and information); study conflicts

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to make sense of an enemy's tactics, discern a hidden threat, or intimidate a foe whose weaknesses you have previously assessed (see "Read the Opposition" below).

![The Obviator](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-obviator-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 obviator, you gain proficiency with [alchemist's supplies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies.md).

Head office also grants you the use of [alchemist's supplies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies.md) (two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients including salt, powdered iron, and purified water); your choice of a [vial of acid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/acid-vial.md), a [flask of alchemist's fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md), or a [vial of antitoxin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/antitoxin-vial.md); and a [hunting trap](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hunting-trap.md).

#### Read the Opposition

Also at rank 1, you can attempt to get a reading on one creature you can see, trying to learn useful information about it. As a bonus action, make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. On a success, you learn three details of your choice about the creature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once on any creature.

> [!quote]- A quote from [Omin Dran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md)  
> 
> Obviation is as much a philosophy as it is a practice. It's not a good fit for those who want to remain... you know, fully alive.

Possible details you might learn include the creature's goals or motivation, bonds or ideals, personality traits, flaws, combat strategy (including common attack methods or tactics), financial information, lair location, allies or foes, romantic entanglements, sense of humor, or favorite songs.

#### Alchemist's Insight

At rank 2, you can use an action to use your alchemist's supplies to identify any unknown substance (including alchemical items, potions, and other magical substances). Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

![Alchemist's Insight; Where You First Dabbled in Alchemy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/alchemists-insight-where-you-first-dabbled-in-alchemy-ai.md)

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/016-02-15.webp#center)

#### Obviator's Lenses

Also at rank 2, you gain the use of an uncommon magic item taking the form of a pair of spectacles, a spyglass, a monocle, or any other device with one or two lenses. When you look through the [obviator's lenses](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/obviators-lenses-ai.md), you use a bonus action to make them function as [eyes of minute seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/eyes-of-minute-seeing.md) or [eyes of the eagle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/eyes-of-the-eagle.md). Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed until the next dawn.

> [!quote]-  
> 
> Like many Obviators, "Lok" chooses to use a working name rather than her actual name out of an abundance of caution. Obviators are cautious because they know precisely how dangerous any moment can be—and they are dangerous for the same reason. An obviator is like a lethal walking library. And if you were to face some kind of walking library at some point, Lok would know exactly what to do about it.

^dwarf-obviator-cleric

#### Advanced Preparations

At rank 3, you gain the ability to declare that you're totally prepared. This preparedness takes the from of asking yourself one question, then making a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check. On a success, you recall information you could have uncovered through earlier research about your mission. The information can be a discreet revelation, a vague hint, or even a riddle. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

![Travel Alchemical Kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/017-02-16.webp#center)

#### Travel Alchemical Kit

Also at rank 3, Head Office provides you with a [travel alchemical kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/travel-alchemical-kit-ai.md)—an uncommon magic item containing miniaturized versions of both [alchemist's supplies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies.md) and a [poisoner's kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/poisoners-kit.md) (glass vials, a mortar and pestle, chemicals, and a glass stirring rod). You gain proficiency with a [poisoner's kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/poisoners-kit.md) as part of this upgrade.

You can use this magical kit as long as it is on your person, with no need to draw or stow it. If you are ever searched, finding your [travel alchemical kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/travel-alchemical-kit-ai.md) requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

#### Enhanced Lenses

At rank 4, your [obviator's lenses](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/obviators-lenses-ai.md) gain additional power and become a rare magic item. The lenses now function as both [eyes of the eagle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/eyes-of-the-eagle.md) and [eyes of minute seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/eyes-of-minute-seeing.md).

Additionally, you can focus the power of the lenses to gain accuracy in combat, gaining advantage on a weapon attack roll (no action required). If that attack hits, roll one additional weapon damage die. This property of the lenses can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Obviate the Opposition

Also at rank 4, when you use your Read the Opposition feature and fail the check, you still learn one detail about the target creature, as chosen by the DM. Additionally, you can use Read the Opposition more than once on the same creature, but if you do so, you cannot use that feature again on the same creature until you finish a long rest.

![Why Be an Obviator?](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/why-be-an-obviator-ai.md)

### Occultant

> [!quote]- A quote from Occultant divination  
> 
> *Our next kill changes everything*.

An occultant tracks the creatures and foes that a franchise has bested or killed, weighing them against the deeds the franchise has achieved. Using the eldritch abacus for which this position is named, an occultant measures the karmic coordinates of their franchise, hoping to gain portents of that which is yet to come.

Like all occultants, you are a grim and enigmatic figure. Even your closest companions might be wary of the power you channel—and nobody wears that aura of dark mystery like you do. You help advance your franchise by determining whether foes should live or die, prognosticating correctly (or at least authoritatively), keeping the rest of the party attuned to the importance of karma, and making the right calls on how best to "clean up" any incorrect readings or misunderstandings.

**Noteworthy Occultants**: Talanatha Three-Coins

**Essential Functions**: Track kills; assess the value to the franchise of the living and the dead

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to intimidate a creature close to death, assess what disease or poison killed a creature, or explain what that dead body is doing under your bed at the inn.

![The Occultant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-occultant-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 occultant, you gain proficiency with one of the following of your choice: [cook's utensils](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cooks-utensils.md), [leatherworker's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/leatherworkers-tools.md), or [weaver's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/weavers-tools.md).

Head office also grants you the use of a tool kit for your chosen proficiency, a merchant's scale, five waterproof belt pouches in which to store creature parts or other tools, and a unique item known as an [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) (sometimes just referred to as an occultant), whose beads resemble tiny skulls.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/018-02-17.webp#center)

#### Read the Kill

Also at rank 1, your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) not only tracks your franchise's kills, it helps you determine the impact of those kills on the franchise's fate. Over a period of 1 minute, you can study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the character who slew it a `d10`. Once within the next hour, that character can add the `d10` to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it's not clear who administered the killing blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

![Ways to Read the Kill](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/ways-to-read-the-kill-ai.md)

#### Eldritch Occultant

Starting at rank 2, your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) becomes an uncommon magic item that can track lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your *occultant abacus* within 5 feet of a creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the [augury](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md) spell. The course of action you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This property of the [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Bring Out Your Dead

Also at rank 2, you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short or long rest.

![Occultant Abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/019-02-18.webp#center)

#### Bead of Instant Karma

At rank 3, one of the beads on your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md)  channels the power of instant karma, turning the *occultant abacus* into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) at the next dawn.

#### Death's Omen

Also at rank 3, you gain the ability to read the grim portents of a creature's demise. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is below its hit point maximum and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. On a success, you determine whether this creature's immediate death would have neutral, negative, or positive ramifications for you and your franchise. If the ramifications are different for you and the franchise, you learn this as well.

#### Bead of Diverted Karma

At rank 4, one of the beads on your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md)  allows you to divert karma to where it's needed, turning the [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) into a very rare magic item. While the bead is unused, you know automatically when any creature you can see is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a `d10` to a different creature you can see. That creature can add the `d10` to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) at the next dawn.

#### Correct the Balance

As a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature's death, you can use your [occultant abacus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/occultant-abacus-ai.md) to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the nature of the creature and its place in the world.

If you fail the check, this property of the *occultant abacus* can't be used again until the next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can't be used again until dawn seven days later.

### Secretarian

> [!quote]- A quote from Secretarian's boast  
> 
> *I've sold ice in Icewind Dale*.

A secretarian's focus is on people—and all the potential value that might be wrung out of them. Every person met outside a franchise is a potential customer to a secretarian, who does whatever they can to bring that relationship to fulfillment. A secretarian seeks always to promote their franchise and gain greater value than they give. They have the skills to negotiate with subemployees, temporary hirelings, seasonal staff, and other humanoid (usually) resources. When staff members have problems, the secretarian is the one who patiently listens (or at least pretends to) until everything calms down.

As a secretarian, you are respected for having the fortitude to listen to both customers and coworkers without going insane. You help advance your franchise by keeping staff happy (enough), hiring competent (enough) workers, coming up with slogans and catchphrases, launching marketing schemes, and getting jingles and slogans stuck in customer's heads. And while your superiors don't officially condone undermining the branding efforts of other organizations, no one can argue with the effectiveness of that approach.

**Noteworthy Secretarians**: Certainty Dran, Dunbar of Spreck

**Essential Functions**: Extract information; assess the strengths and weaknesses of others

**Position Proficiency**: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to convince a suspicious crowd of your good (or at least non-evil) intentions, encourage franchise hirelings to work faster, or improvise a jingle extolling the virtues of your franchise.

![The Secretarian](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-secretarian-ai.md)

#### Proficiencies and Starting Equipment

As a rank 1 secretarian, you gain proficiency with one of the following of your choice: gaming set, musical instrument, or [disguise kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/disguise-kit.md).

Head office also grants you the use of a tool kit for your chosen proficiency, a collection of sales brochures, a set of business cards, a metal bell, and a [set of fine clothes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/fine-clothes.md).

> [!quote]- A quote from [Omin Dran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md)  
> 
> My daughter Certainty created the secretarian role. Proved it out as a concept. I told her we didn't need them. I was wrong.

#### Sending Stone

Also at rank 1, you are given use of an Acquisitions Incorporated [sending stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stone-ai.md), an uncommon magic item that resembles a gemstone in a bold setting. It functions like a normal [sending stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stones.md), except that it has no matching stone and allows communication with Head Office, specific secretarians you know, and the secretarian nearest your location. You must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to establish contact. Once the stone is successfully used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Making contact with another secretarian assumes that they are in possession of their own [sending stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stone-ai.md).

![Quirks of Your Sending Stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/quirks-of-your-sending-stone-ai.md)

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/020-02-19.webp#center)

#### Portfolio Keeper

At rank 2, you gain the use of a weathered leather pouch that is an uncommon magic item. The [portfolio keeper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portfolio-keeper-ai.md) holds and organizes notes, brochures, and business cards bearing your contact information. It also has an inexhaustible supply of brochures related to your franchise's current branding scheme.

When you meet someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored on a small parchment card in the [portfolio keeper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portfolio-keeper-ai.md). You can access the details of any such stored card as a bonus action.

> [!quote]-

> Spreck isn't a real place, but Dunbar knows most people won't check. They'll see the "of" in there and think, "Spreck, you say! Sounds fancy." Maintaining a protective patina of efficiency around himself, the franchise, and the larger organization is his specialty. Secretarians talk to each other more than they talk to their own party members. But that works out in the end, because the secretarian network's limitless perspectives mean that the network often knows more about franchisees than they do themselves.

^sun-elf-secretarian-barbarian

#### Rumor Mill

Also at rank 2, whenever your franchise begins a major quest or mission, make a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check. On a success, you can learn up to three rumors related to creatures or organizations involved in the mission, which come to you through your [sending stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stone-ai.md). These rumors reflect current or historical knowledge possessed by Acquisitions Incorporated or the organization's many contacts.

![Sending Stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/acquisitions-incorporated/img/021-02-20.webp#center)

#### Cards of Sending

At rank 3, the power of your *portfolio keeper* becomes more potent, making it a rare magic item. When you give out a business card stored in your [portfolio keeper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portfolio-keeper-ai.md), you can choose to have the card allow its recipient to contact you through your [sending stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stone-ai.md) as if they had cast a [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell. A business card loses this power seven days after it has been given out, and no more than five cards can have this power at one time.

You can also use your [sending stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stone-ai.md) to cast [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) and contact anyone who has one of your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later.

#### Improved Rumor Mill

At rank 3, when you use your Rumor Mill feature, the DM provides you with a sense of which parts of a particular rumor are inaccurate, if any. You do not necessarily learn the truth behind those false rumors.

#### Always Hiring

At rank 4, you have little trouble finding the right people for the job. As an action, while in a populated area, you can make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to locate an NPC who can provide a service immediately, no questions asked, for the standard fee (see ""Services"" in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook"). On a successful check, information regarding the potential hire comes to you as supernatural insight, word of mouth, an advertisement blowing into your face, or a similarly convenient method. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

Hirelings acquired through this feature are in addition to any franchise staff. They can be invited to bolster existing staff or fill a sudden need, but they are not part of the baseline staff gained through a franchise's rank. Their pay is not covered by the franchise's normal costs.

#### Charming Introduction

Also at rank 4, you are able to make a focused effort to keep a potential customer's attention. When you provide a humanoid with a business card from your [portfolio keeper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portfolio-keeper-ai.md), you can cast [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md) on them (save DC 15). The spell ends prematurely if the character loses the business card.

## Franchise Tasks and Downtime

As talked about in the "Player's Handbook" and the "Dungeon Master's Guide", downtime activities allow players and DMs to make the breaks between adventures into a compelling part of the campaign. In between the highlights of slogging through dungeons, infiltrating death cults, and being generally heroic, characters can practice professions, engage in research, create special items, and indulge other activities beyond adventuring.

Because an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is focused on the franchise, downtime is typically a big part of the game. (The adventure that makes up chapter 4 of this book, "The Orrery of the Wanderer," sets up downtime options between adventure episodes as a key component of the campaign.) But an Acq Inc campaign offers even more robust options for characters who want to get things done outside adventuring time, because the heroes of an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign have something that most adventurers don't—a well-paid (okay, an occasionally paid) staff.

In addition to the downtime activities characters undertake on their own, the hard-working subemployees and interns of a franchise can carry out orders and further the characters' goals through research, crafting, social encounters, and so forth. This lets the players direct behind-the-scenes activities even as the characters focus on the more rarefied pursuits of killing monsters and taking their stuff. Before your party sets out for the Fortress of Eternal Peril, an intern can be sent to research that magic book found in a previous adventure. Your majordomo might spend time currying favor with nobles as a means of expanding the franchise's reputation. And what could be more fun (for you) than to have the staff engage in a bit of dangerous criminal activity? If they're successful, the franchise gets the profits! And if they get caught, who are these people you barely know?

### Franchise Tasks in the Campaign

By allowing franchise tasks to take place not just during downtime but while the characters are adventuring, it's possible for players in an Acquisitions Incorporated game to try to push the pace of the campaign. Characters might try to avoid taking downtime of their own in favor of having franchise employees take care of all that boring not-adventuring stuff. But because an Acq Inc campaign makes great use of social encounters, research, and intrigue, players should be encouraged to not treat downtime as optional. Moreover, DMs can and will make use of rivalries and complications during franchise tasks to drag characters into that part of the game.

#### Between Adventures

Using the traditional approach to downtime, franchise tasks can be run at set break points during the campaign. When the characters return from adventuring, they take on some of the responsibility for bookkeeping, maintenance, long-term planning, and the like, making franchise staff available for other activities under the characters' guidance. In this model, characters and staff run downtime simultaneously between sessions of adventuring. This follows the standard approach of using downtime to advance the timeline of the campaign.

#### Ongoing Activities

A more wide-open approach to franchise tasks sees the characters direct those activities at any point during the campaign, alongside traditional adventuring. During any game session, the players can decide to focus on what the franchise staff are up to by setting assignments, giving orders, and making checks to determine the success of franchise tasks. If those tasks tie strongly into the adventure, franchise tasks can effectively become a fourth pillar of an Acquisitions Incorporated game, alongside exploration, social interaction, and combat.

### Selecting Franchise Tasks

Whether franchise tasks are undertaken during regular downtime or alongside other adventuring activities, a franchise's rank puts a hard limit on the number of tasks the franchise's staff can undertake. See the ""Franchise Advancement"" section earlier in this chapter. (This limit is only for franchise tasks undertaken by staff. The characters are free to undertake whatever downtime activities the DM allows, as normal.)

For each available franchise task slot, players can allocate one or more staff members to a chosen franchise task. Those tasks can include any of the downtime activities in the "Player's Handbook" or the "Dungeon Master's Guide", the new and revised downtime activities in "Xanathar's Guide to Everything", and the new activities in this section. When all of a franchise's task slots are filled, one of those tasks must be completed before staff can be allocated to a new franchise task. (The one exception to this rule is the running a franchise activity, presented later in this section. That activity must be performed by a franchise, but does not require that specific characters or staff members be allocated to it.)

Staff allocated to a franchise task are no longer available for other needs, including other franchise tasks. Any costs or resources associated with a franchise task must be provided by the franchise (which is to say, by the characters).

For example, a rank 2 franchise can undertake two concurrent franchise tasks. If the characters are setting out to explore the Swamp of Lingering Malaise, they might order their majordomo to send messages to various noble families while they're away, carrying out the sowing rumors activity from the "Dungeon Master's Guide". The task follows the regular rules for that downtime activity, but is carried out by the majordomo. At the same time, the characters might send out another staff member to engage in the explore territory activity (a new activity detailed below).

> 
> You can't expect to get everything done yourself. Delegation is key. And the consequences for fumbling a simple task should be real, immediate, and serve as a lesson to others who serve you. No dessert for a tenday! That'll teach 'em.

### Making Task Checks

When a franchise task requires an ability check, a staff member can use their own ability check modifier to determine success. (This modifier might depend on the staff member's statistics, if an NPC, or it might be based on the franchise's rank. See the ""Franchise Advancement"" section.) Alternatively, the staff member can use the check modifier of a character overseeing the task and giving the staff member direction. This can encourage the characters to develop closer relationships with franchise staff through roleplaying, and keeps the players involved in staff-focused franchise tasks.

### Franchise Tasks as Narrative

Franchise tasks can be an exciting, story-rich part of a gaming session. Over time, franchise tasks and character downtime activities can expand the story of a franchise and add depth to the characterizations of its NPC staff members. The successes, failures, and complications of franchise tasks might even become pivotal moments in the campaign.

As with all aspects of an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, franchise tasks are about creating narrative. As such, to make those tasks a part of the campaign story, the DM and the players can work together to break tasks down into distinct scenes using the following guidelines.

#### Establish Goals

When the characters select a franchise task, the players share their goals for that task with the DM. Having clear motives helps establish the stakes and provides ideas that the DM can weave into the campaign story. The DM might work up a narrative based on the players' initial discussions, and might ask additional questions to help narrow down options.

As an example, consider a group of characters whose franchise headquarters is a submersible ship, and whose staff are largely former pirates. While the characters head out for a mission on the mainland, they direct the ship's staff-member captain to surprise other vessels and liberate goods from them. The DM decides that such acts of piracy fit the shady business practice activity (introduced later in this section), and quickly sketches out a few ideas for the task.

#### Opening Scene

The DM describes the beginning of the task activity, setting the stage for the NPCs' actions. For the submersible headquarters discussed above, the DM might begin to describe how the ship leaves port in search of easy prey. The captain and crew are in a good mood. There's a storm in the area, but it doesn't threaten the submersible. The DM might ask the players to describe a few undertakings the crew can engage in to pass the time, or might even ask players to temporarily take on the roles of one or more staff members, helping to bring those NPCs to life through roleplaying.

#### Ability Check Scenes

For each ability check required by a franchise task, the DM describes what's happening, determines the applicable ability, and decides whether a skill or tool proficiency is appropriate (usually as suggested in the activity write-up). Whether the check is made by a staff member or the character who directed or set up the franchise task, a player makes the roll. The DM can encourage roleplaying by asking about what kind of guidance a character provided to the staff member, or what part of the staff member's background makes them good at the task at hand. The DM then describes successive scenes based on checks and roleplaying as the crew members locate a likely target ship and commence their attack.

#### Concluding Scene

The DM determines the overall outcome for the franchise task, then narrates the outcome to wrap up that small part of the overall story. If the check for the activity indicates any degree of success, the DM describes how the franchise's pirates manage to grab some valuable cargo, in addition to other benefits as noted in the write-up for the shady business practice activity. With treasure aboard, the ship is ready for the characters' eventual return.

#### Ongoing Story

Rather than treating franchise tasks as isolated episodes, the DM can weave the story of one task into the next, and can tie franchise tasks into the overarching campaign. Doing so assigns importance to franchise tasks, and lets the players understand how the success or failure of those tasks might drive the campaign. Even after a specific franchise task has concluded, the DM can make notes for how that task might tie to future tasks. For the characters running the submersible franchise, the ship that fought off the franchise's pirates might remember a few details about the franchise crew. Or perhaps the plundered vessel belongs to a franchise rival, or even a foreign dignitary the characters will eventually meet, setting up a future plot twist.

^downtime-activities

### Complications and Rivals

The franchise and downtime activities introduced in this section all incorporate the idea that such activities can introduce ongoing complications to the campaign, and that anything a franchise's characters or employees do might bring the franchise into conflict with rivals.

If you use "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" in your games, you're probably already familiar with complications and rivals as part of downtime, but you don't need to own that book to make use of these ideas. Rather, just remember that an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always about story. Each time the characters engage in downtime or direct their staff in a franchise task, the players and the DM can think about how those tasks and activities might complicate the ongoing campaign narrative, and how the franchise's enemies—or potential enemies—might get caught up in those complications.

When a complication or a rival comes into play during downtime or franchise activities, the DM determines the particulars. The activities presented at the end of this section all come with tables of possible complications, but the DM is free to come up with even more dastardly complications to suit the campaign.

#### Who's Watching?

An easy way to focus on complications and rivals in a campaign is to think about who might be paying attention to a franchise's activities. For example, a successful philanthropic enterprise (one of the new activities in this section) could draw the attention of a noble who begins to question the reputation and honesty of the characters running the franchise. Or the party might launch a marketeering campaign (another new activity), only to discover that their branding has an accidental resemblance to the logo of an assassins' guild. Complications are an excellent way to develop rich interactions between the setting and the characters. In an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, even the smallest actions can have unexpected (and, ideally, hilarious) consequences.

Rivals represent any of the factions and organizations that can come into play during an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Rivals don't have to be villains or mortal enemies of the characters, though. Other Acq Inc franchises all compete with the characters' franchise, seeking to expand their own reach and impress Head Office. Governments, merchants, guilds, religious institutions, and noble families can all take notice as a franchise grows in power. And outside the characters' immediate sphere of influence, factions such as Dran Enterprises and the Six work dark plots that might make the characters targets for assimilation or destruction. (The plots of the Six and the operations of Dran Enterprises both play a part in the adventure "The Orrery of the Wanderer," chapter 4 of this book.)

When a complication occurs during a downtime or franchise activity, the DM determines whether and how that complication connects to a rival. Certain complications might be caused by rivals, as when the orc army camping in the characters' territory is revealed to have been invited there by a competing franchise. Other complications might draw a rival in, as when a greedy noble decides they want a piece of the franchise's action.

Rival NPCs can be worked up using the rules in chapter 4, ""Creating Nonplayer Characters"" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide", incorporating schemes, methods, and weaknesses. If you use "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" in your game, that book provides example rivals and talks about establishing a rival's goals, assets, and plans. See also the ""Factions and Rivals"" section in chapter 3 of this book for an introduction to some of the rival organizations that might appear in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.

#### Complications as Story

Complications and rivals make excellent adventure seeds. Whenever a complication or rival draws the interest of the players, the DM can make a note of that for future development. As the campaign progresses, the agendas of rivals change over time, just as the characters' goals and agendas change as a result of their franchise's success (or their efforts to stave off failure).

The DM can decide how to invoke complications as the campaign story unfolds. Perhaps the characters were forced to slay an evil guard in a raid gone bad. Later, their majordomo engages in a little gambling as part of a franchise task... and finds the suspicious husband of the guard at their gaming table! Likewise, if a franchise has recently tangled with Dran Enterprises or opposed another Acq Inc franchise, the chance of a complication with either group likely goes up.

### Downtime and Franchise Activities

In addition to the downtime activities found in other books, characters and their franchise staff can undertake the new activities presented in this section, either as regular downtime activities or as franchise tasks that can be undertaken at any time. These activities reflect the central role of the franchise in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.

The length of time required for these new downtime or franchise activities varies, from a number of days to one workweek (5 days) or more. All the normal rules for downtime must be followed by the character or NPC undertaking the downtime or franchise activity, including spending 8 hours each day engaged in that activity for the day to count toward the activity's completion. The one exception to this rule is that any costs for a franchise activity are paid for by the characters, even if franchise staff are executing the task.

Some downtime and franchise activities alter a franchise's monthly costs. See the ""Franchise Advancement"" section earlier in this chapter for how to determine a franchise's base monthly costs, and see the ""Running a Franchise"" section below for more information on how that activity modifies the base cost.

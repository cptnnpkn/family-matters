# Chapter 4: The Orrery of the Wanderer
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated, p. 79* 

> [!note] No Players Allowed

> This part of the book is for the DM only. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now! Unless you want to keep going, that is. Because seriously, it's not like anyone's going to stop you. After all, information is powerâ€”in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, and in life. Maybe you having a bit of an inside track is just what this adventure needs to make it really pop, and to keep the DM from getting all, "Ooh, look at me! I'm the one with the secrets!" I mean, can you believe how smug they are? It's like they're just begging you to turn the page...

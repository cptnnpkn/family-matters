# About Eldraine
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures* 

Eldraine is a storybook world of quests and castles, knights and wizards, wicked warlocks and fantastical creatures. Once, valiant knights would venture from five royal courts to fulfill noble quests—but the invasion of the horrific Phyrexians from another world changed all that and left the kingdom in ruins.

The realm and the wilds of Eldraine were introduced to players of Magic: The Gathering with 2019's *Throne of Eldraine* set. The new *Wilds of Eldraine* set presents the world in the wake of the Phyrexian invasion, leaving behind the knights and castles and delving deep into the strange and mysterious wilds. Here, giants lumber through the clouds, faeries make mischief, and witches cackle over bubbling cauldrons.

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block, which appears in the "Monster Manual" unless noted otherwise.

## The Wilds

Past the courts, across the stream, into the woods—there lie the wilds, the most magical, strange, and dangerous lands in all Eldraine. In contrast to the order and structure of the realm, the wilds are unpredictable and not united under any one system of government.

The lands of the wilds are just as untamed and diverse as the creatures that live there. Magic runs rampant, manifesting in strange and often beautiful ways. It can be alluring, empowering, and restorative. It can also be repellent, enervating, and destructive.

Countless species of sapient creatures dwell in the wilds, including humans. In addition to those described in this collection, many creatures from the "Monster Manual" and other sources live in the wilds of Eldraine:

- **Humans.** Whether driven by desperation or a desire to live outside the courts, humans have always existed in the wilds. These humans include resilient and resourceful hunters, foresters, and artisans, and they often pick up some of the eccentricities of their more fantastical neighbors. In addition to the nonplayer character stat blocks found in the "Monster Manual" and other sources, see the [Knight of Eldraine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight-of-eldraine-mcv4ec.md) in this collection.  
- **Elves.** Scions of a once-mighty empire, the elves of Eldraine have found new purpose in their role as guardians of nature. Most elves move through the woods in small bands of hunters, gatherers, and druids, though some still reside within crumbling forts and overgrown castles that dot the wilds. In addition to the nonplayer character stat blocks found in the "Monster Manual" and other sources, see the [Redtooth werefox](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/redtooth-werefox-mcv4ec.md) in this collection.  
- **Dwarves.** The dwarves of Eldraine include miners, blacksmiths, and other artisans who value hard work and independence. These artisans take pride in creating intricate jewelry and sturdy weapons from the minerals they mine, and they value the dignity of work.  
- **Merfolk.** In the wilds, [merfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/merfolk.md) are known as covetous keepers of arcane magic, knowledge, and artifacts. They are said to hoard precious magic items, tomes, and other secrets in lochs, ponds, and wishing wells across Eldraine.  
- **Fauns.** Prior to the Phyrexian invasion, fauns (use the [satyr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) stat block) were reclusive creatures living in tight family units deep in the forest. Seeing their homeland under attack inspired them to leave the woods and join the rest of Eldraine in its defense. Since the end of the invasion, the fauns have taken charge of the Tanglespan, a great chasm between the realm and the wilds. They map out the crisscrossing pathways spanning the chasm, fight off the [trolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/troll.md) who lurk beneath the bridges in hope of feasting on travelers, and guide travelers across the chasm in exchange for a modest toll.  
- **Giants.** Giants are the rare creatures equally at home in the realm or the wilds. In Garenbrig and Embereth, [fire giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) and [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) served as mighty knights and strong laborers. In the wilds, [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) have always been hostile to the rulers of the realm, even when elves governed the land. [Cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md) and [storm giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) live far above the wilds on islands made of magical cloud. (See the [tempest hart](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/tempest-hart-mcv4ec.md) entry in this collection for more on Stormkeld and its giant inhabitants.) "Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants" includes many additional giant stat blocks as well as descriptions of other creatures that might be found in Stormkeld, such as [giant geese](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/giant-goose-bgg.md) and [giant oxen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/giant-ox-bgg.md).  
- **Redcaps.** Redcaps (use the [redcap](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md) stat block in "Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse" or the [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) stat block) are mischievous agents of chaos. They fight without any sense of honor or fair play; they specialize in sneak attacks and ambushes and often raid villages across the Boundary Lands before retreating deeper into the wilds.  
- **Ogres.** Ogres are smaller and meaner than other giants, with vicious tempers and a propensity for violence. In addition to the ogre stat blocks in the "Monster Manual" and "Monsters of the Multiverse", see the [ogre chitterlord](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-chitterlord-mcv4ec.md) in this collection.

# Introduction
*Source: One Grung Above, p. 2* 

Ever since I joined the D&D team in 2010, I've thought about a future where the grung were "a thing" again. These long-forgotten amphibians from the 2nd Edition Greyhawk setting had captured my heart and imagination long ago. So, it was with some amount of grit that I entered them into the fray of creatures to be selected as part of Volo's Guide to Monsters. They certainly weren't the favored choice, but in the end when we each received a "golden ticket" to give to one creature. Despite jeers from my coworkers, it was clear to me what my choice would be. Grung for life!!!

Since then, I was given the opportunity to reimagine them, rewrite them, and include them among creatures that can potentially exist in any D&D campaign setting... and then it happened. Someone asked me to DM a table of players during the Stream of Annihilation. With the ALL-STAR cast of celebrities that would be attending, plus superstar DMs like Chris Perkins and Mike Mearls to follow, I had to find something that would set me apart from the rest... or at least confirm to the world that I'm simply an eccentric goofball... either way sounded great to me. At this point I mused out loud... "What if my players were ALL grung?" The rest is history... and the future. You can even watch it on YouTube.

I want to thank these individuals... all fantastic DMs as well, that brought the grung in the Stream of Annihilation game to life. Matt Colville as b'Loop; Mark Hulmes as b'Lip; Adam Koebel as b'Lahp; and Nadja Otikor as c'Ahbülos... And I want to thank those who continue to 'Grung it up!' on Twitch with me... Satine Phoenix as d'Ahten'khan; Ruty Rutenberg as b'Leep; Lauren Urban as b'Ang'r'Ang; and special welcome to my new player... Cig Neutron as the albino dwarf monk Mee'Yah-Ghee.

You've all made me a VERY HOPPY DM!

## d'Ahten'khan

### 5th-level Grung Monk Courtier

*Way of the Open Hand*

As an orange grung, d'Ahten'khan is the highest caste member of the group, and its strategic leader. Not the most studied grung, d'Ahten'khan relied heavily on c'Ahbülos for relevant information and lore, prior to the red grung's untimely demise at the hands of the batiri.

d'Ahten'khan now relies on b'Ang'r'Ang, whom she trusts implicitly with communicating her commands to b'Leep, a green grung scout, and last remaining member of her squad. As b'Leep is well beneath her station d'Ahten'khan will not ever communicate directly with this lower caste grung.

As the leader of a previously successful band of grung, d'Ahten'khan developed aspirations of nobility, and finds it difficult to not overly communicate these to any worthy grung who will listen.

## b'Ang'r'Ang

### 5th-level Grung Rogue Outlander

*Mastermind*

As a higher caste hunter and purple grung, b'Ang'r'Ang is the tactical, courageous leader and devoted mentor of b'Lip, b'Loop, b'Leep, and b'Lahp. The most conscientious of the group, she bears the burden of responsibility for her green cousins, which previously led to conflict with b'Lip, who prefers to act before thinking.

Recognizing her place in the grung hierarchy, b'Ang'r'Ang is responsible for working with the brothers to execute on "plans" developed by d'Ahten'khan, who relies upon b'Ang'r'Ang to communicate instructions to the much-lower caste green grung. After a recent batiri goblin ambush where the band of grung scattered to the four winds, the whereabouts of b'Lip, b'Loop, and b'Lahp remain unknown.

## b'Leep

### 5th-level Grung Rogue Outlander

*Scout*

One of four nearly identical green grung, b'Leep was raised from an egg alongside his siblings. The grung were trained from hatchlings to be the ultimate band of hunters.

Quiet and methodical, b'Leep experiences a greater than average level of anxiety... EVERYWHERE. Constantly on the lookout for the tricks and traps of others, b'Leep has an almost intuitive sense for dealing with strange locks and mechanisms, and is quite knowledgeable about the jungle and its dangers. He is extremely loyal to his siblings and b'Ang'r'Ang.

## Mee'Yah-Ghee

### 6th-level Albino Dwarf Monk Hermit

*Way of the Drunken Master*

A devoted member of the Ytepka Society, Mee'YahGhee spends most of his time occupying various taverns in the Merchant's Ward of Port Nyanzaru, drinking, and generally keeping tabs on goings on in the city in that regard. All manner of folks are willing to talk freely around a drunk albino dwarf that can barely seem to recall his own name.

Years ago, during his hermitage, Mee'Yah-Ghee trained the young grung d'Ahtenkhan. As he's heard of the shake up in the hierarchy within her army, Mee'Yah-Ghee has ventured into the jungle to find his student and help her in any way he can.

> [!note] Whistle-Stick
> 
> The grung of ONE GRUNG ABOVE are trained to use this new musical instrument. This is a hollow tube with holes cut throughout, much like a flute. You can play music with it for entertainment, but the grung also swing it about by a sturdy cord (attached) to create a sound recognizable by other grung, so they know each other's approximate location. Additionally, grung that know Thieves' Cant can use a whistle stick in this manner to communicate over distance.

# Treasures
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War, p. 275* 

Magic plays a vital role in the day-to-day life of Khorvaire. Common magic items are widespread, and the crystals known as dragonshards serve as the fuel of the magical economy and are used in items that amplify the powers of dragonmarks.

## Dragonshards

Dragonshards aren't magic items themselves but are crystals imbued with magical energy. They play a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of certain rituals in Eberron. Dragonshards come in three varieties, each found in a different environment.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/149-5-02.webp#center)

**Eberron dragonshards** are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools—such as the lightning rail and elemental airships—require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.

**Khyber dragonshards** are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.

**Siberys dragonshards** fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.

## Magic Items

The world of Eberron thrums with the power of magic. Artificers, magewrights, wizards, and other spellcasters produce an abundance of magic items, particularly those with the common rarity.

## Magic Item Descriptions

This section presents a selection of magic items in alphabetical order. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for the rules on using magic items.

Some of the magic items in this chapter are symbiotic objects created by the daelkyr. While not fully sentient, these symbiotic items are partially organic. Attuning to such an item reflects physically bonding with it. While these objects aren't evil, some people might be disturbed upon seeing your living armor or tentacle whip!

## Eldritch Machines

In a Cannith enclave, a team of artificers maintain a creation forge that produces warforged. In the Shadow Marches, druids guard the seals that hold the daelkyr at bay. In the sewers below Sharn, a mad necromancer puts the final touches on a device that will turn the city's residents into undead. Such contraptions are categorized as eldritch machines—magical devices of immense power that are too large to be moved easily. Eldritch machines are marvels of magic and engineering that require special components and conditions to function. For example, a particular eldritch machine might function only in a manifest zone where two or more planes are coterminous.

Ultimately, eldritch machines are plot devices that can represent the culmination of a villain's master plan or a last defense against evil.

### Creation Forge

A creation forge is a spherical chamber that contains a floating obelisk. This obelisk creates warforged souls and places them in newly constructed warforged bodies. Only dragonmarked members of House Cannith can create and maintain such devices, and though the Treaty of Thronehold mandated the destruction of all creation forges in Khorvaire after the Last War, at least one creation forge is rumored to exist in the bowels of Sharn.

### Dimensional Seal

A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) field in a 2-mile radius. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches—reminders of the conflict between the Gatekeepers and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be dire consequences for the world.

### Mabaran Resonator

This dread device draws on the power of Mabar, infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night. While it is active, any humanoid that dies within 2 miles of the resonator reanimates 1 minute later as a zombie (see the "Monster Manual" for its stat block) under the control of the creature controlling the device.

![Storm Spire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/151-5-04.webp#center)

### Master's Call

While this looks like a scrap heap assembled from shattered constructs, this eldritch machine possesses great power. A creature in control of it can sense the presence and location of all warforged within 10 miles of the device and can, as an action, send a telepathic message to them laced with enchantment magic. Such a message can be sent no more than once every 24 hours. A warforged who receives the message is compelled to follow one command contained within it, unless the warforged succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. The affected warforged breaks free of the command after 24 hours.

### Spell Sink

This device emanates an antimagic field (same effects as the [antimagic field](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell) in a radius of 1 to 3 miles. The field can be activated or deactivated as an action with a touch by its controller.

The form that the device takes depends on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, so a spell sink created by them might be a living artifact, such as a twisted tree that consumes the magical energy around it. Conversely, a spell sink created by a mad artificer might be a massive vessel composed of dragonshards and exotic metals.

A variant device called the spell siphon not only neutralizes magic but also absorbs all magical energy in the area, storing that power for a cataclysmic effect.

### Storm Spire

This eldritch machine can only be controlled by creatures that bear the Mark of Storm. Storm spires allow House Lyrandar to influence the weather, which can be a boon for the local population or a curse if a Lyrandar baron chooses to demand payment for ideal weather.

## Everyday Magic Items

Thanks to dragonshards, common magic items—including the ones in "Xanathar's Guide to Everything"—are readily available in Khorvaire.

### Buying a Common Magic item

In Eberron, common magic items can be found for sale in most communities. The DM determines the stock that is available, or the DM has the shoppers make a group Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find a shop or peddler that has the desired item in stock. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, at least 24 hours must pass before looking for the same item in that community.

The DM sets the price of a common magic item or determines it randomly: `2d4 × 10` gp, or half as much for a consumable item such as a potion or scroll.

### Creating Common Magic Items

Normally, a magic item in Eberron is created using the crafting rules in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" or "Xanathar's Guide to Everything". But if you have a dragonshard, you can more easily create a common magic item.

To create such an item with a dragonshard, a character must have proficiency in the tools used to create a nonmagical version of the item or proficiency in the [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill. For example, a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) can be created by a character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit. A spellcaster can scribe a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of a spell they know if they have proficiency in the [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill, and they must provide all material components required for the spell. A cantrip scribed onto a scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

The Creating Common Magic Items table states how much time and money you must spend to craft a common magic item with a dragonshard, which is expended in the creation process. The hours of creation can be spread over multiple days, which needn't be consecutive.

![Creating Common Magic Items](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/creating-common-magic-items-erlw.md)

### Crafting Complications

If the DM is using the crafting rules in "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" for items that aren't common, the creation process can involve complications. Assume there's a 10% chance chance of a complication arising for every five workweeks (25 days) spent on crafting the item. "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" presents a number of possible complications, or you can use the Eberron Crafting Complications table.

# Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazetteer
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War, p. 103* 

> [!quote]-  
> 
> Just one century ago, the Kingdom of Galifar spanned most of Khorvaire. Of course, we never tamed the lands beyond the Graywall Mountains or the jungles of the east. Nevertheless, it was impressive, this kingdom of humanity's.

> [!quote]- A quote from Lyrian Das, Morgrave historian  
> 
> Now I look at the map of Khorvaire with a touch of despair. Galifar lies shattered, the Five Nations irreparably divided. So many new realms claim sovereignty—kingdoms of elves and goblins, and what of this nation of monsters called Droaam? Can it last, or will another war fracture us further? Should I dwell on such things when the Mourning might simply consume us all? Gods, how I fear the future.

Most player characters begin their adventures on the continent of Khorvaire, as shown on the poster map included with this book and on "map 2.1". Although humans make up the majority of the population in the nations of Khorvaire, the continent is home to a wide range of peoples and cultures. Once largely unified under the Kingdom of Galifar, today Khorvaire is split into many nations—some old, others newly born from the crucible of war. This chapter provides an overview of Khorvaire, a glimpse of the world that lies beyond it, and the predominant faiths of Eberron.

## Nations of Khorvaire

The following sections focus on what you need to know to create characters and NPCs from Khorvaire. For general information about the Kingdom of Galifar, the Five Nations that arose from the kingdom's ashes, and the Treaty of Thronehold that helps keeps the peace between the nations of Khorvaire, see the introduction of this book.

An excellent system of roads connects the central nations of Khorvaire, and travelers can always make their way by horse or coach. Major cities are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows one to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads. If speed is an issue, one can book passage on a House Lyrandar airship. This is the fastest way to travel, but also the most expensive. This book's introduction has more information about these and other travel options.

## Aundair

**Capital**: Fairhaven

**Hallmarks**: Cheese, education, fashion, grains, wine, wizardry

Fertile farmlands surround the grand cities of Aundair. The floating towers of Arcanix are the finest institute for mystical study in Khorvaire, and magic is deeply ingrained in Aundairian culture. The nation produces more magewrights and wandslingers than any other in Khorvaire.

From the nobles lounging in the towers of Fairhaven to the common folk working the vast vineyards of Bluevine, Aundairians value wit and wisdom. Aundairians prefer finesse to brute force and appreciate cunning wordplay and fine fashions. The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of Aundair, with a particular devotion to Aureon. However, the Silver Flame also maintains a devoted following—some might say overzealous.

Although Aundair is a small nation, its arcane superiority allowed it retain its dominion during the Last War. The people of Aundair know that knowledge is power, and they take pride in their nation's magical advancements. To ensure her nation's prosperity and dominance, Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn instituted the Arcane Initiative, an aggressive series of programs intended to forward the development of mystical infrastructure and battle magic.

### Interesting Things About Aundair

- Arcanix is the most prestigious academy of magic in Khorvaire. Most of its sages specialize in ritual magic and abstract theory, and don't have the full powers of wizards.  
- Magic permeates many aspects of Aundairian life—more so than other nations. A [cleansing stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cleansing-stone-erlw.md) (see "chapter 5") graces every village, and you might encounter animated farming equipment in the fields. The Knights Arcane are an elite unit of eldritch knights, and the spies of the Royal Eyes of Aundair specialize in divination magic.  
- Some Aundairian nobles are bound by arcane pacts handed down through generations. Only remarkable heirs—such as player characters—develop into warlocks. Most such lines have an Archfey patron.  

### Aundairian Characters

Regardless of your Intelligence score, as an Aundairian you're sure you're the smartest person in the room. Consider the following characteristics for your Aundairian:

**Arcane Talent**. If you're not going to play a magic-using class, consider creating a high elf or a human with the Magic Initiate feat. Whether you favor damage-dealing cantrips or more utilitarian ones, every Aundairian should know a little magic.

**Magic Beats Mundane**. Why use your hand when you could use [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md)? Why strain your muscles tugging on a bowstring when you could use a wand?

**Show Some Style**. Don't settle for common clothes and a squalid meal when you could wear [glamerweave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/glamerweave-erlw.md) (see "chapter 5") and drink the finest wine. If you're a fighter, focus on finesse instead of crude strength. And never miss an opportunity for a clever quip.

### Cities and Sites

Aundair intersperses pastoral farmlands between densely populated cities.

![Arcanix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/070-2-02.webp#center)

#### Arcanix

This farming village on Lake Galifar provides food for the nearby floating towers of wizardry that serve as home to Aundair's Arcane Congress—a cutting-edge research facility and the finest school of magic in Khorvaire. The members of the congress oversee the magical research conducted in these towers, advise Aundair's queen on all things magical, and confer with colleagues visiting from other nations.

Apprentices come from all over Khorvaire to train at Arcanix. If you're a wizard, sage, or artificer, you might have learned your craft here.

#### Fairhaven

The capital of Aundair is one of the most beautiful cities in Eberron. Stunning displays of magical light and other arcane wonders enhance the exquisite architecture. This is the seat of the University of Wynarn, a prestigious institution that draws students from across Khorvaire. As a noble, entertainer, or sage, you might have your roots in the City of Lights.

> [!readaloud] The Korranberg Chronicle—wizard war brewing at arcanix?
> 
> Before the war, the Arcane Congress served all Galifar. The most promising students from across Khorvaire came to study at Arcanix, and students from Khorvaire, Cyre, and Aundair worked together to win honor in the Trials of the Ninefold Path. Known to students simply as the Nine, this contest pits students of the eight traditions against one another in a series of arcane challenges, along with a ninth bracket for those who have yet to select a tradition. Teamwork, independence, memorization, innovation—the Nine challenges competitors on many levels, and the finest wizards of Galifar were invariably champions of the Nine.
> 
> Thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, students of all nations once again study side by side in the towers of Arcanix. But no treaty or ritual can easily dispel the tensions of a century of war. Over the last year we've reported on a number of hate crimes in the towers fueled by nationalist passions. Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the diversity that has evolved over the course of the past century—highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, Cyran illusions, and more. But privately, professors fear that the competitive aspect of the Nine will inflame nationalist tension. Some even believe that the lives of foreign students could be endangered should they defeat Aundairian champions.
> 
> Only time will tell if the Nine can bring us together as it once did, or if it will drive us further apart.
^the-korranberg-chroniclewizard-war-brewing-at-arcanix

#### Passage

Located on the shores of Lake Galifar, the city of Passage is the heart of the dragonmarked House Orien. Resources include production and maintenance facilities for the lightning rail and the Orien caravans. If you have the Mark of Passage, odds are good you've spent time here.

#### Stormhome

This island city is the seat of House Lyrandar, and Queen Aurala allows the house a free rein in governing the isle. It is the finest resort and vacation spot in Khorvaire. Spies, charlatans, sailors, and house agents all have a place in Stormhome. Even though the island escaped the devastation wrought during the Last War, it remains a hotbed for clandestine activities.

Lyrandar wizards use magic to continuously alter Stormhome's weather, turning the otherwise bleak and storm-blasted location into a temperate island getaway.

### Aftermath of the Last War

Aundair and Thrane were bitter rivals during the Last War. Thrane seized the ancient city of Thaliost during the war and holds it to this day. Most of the people of Aundair remain furious about the occupation of Thaliost, but the city has become a haven for Aundairians who revere the Silver Flame.

The Eldeen Reaches seceded from Aundair halfway through the Last War. The western farmers rebelled over high taxes and neglect, allying with the druids of the Towering Wood. Aundair was forced to accept the sovereignty of the Reaches under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, but many Aundairians view it as a renegade nation.

Extensive use of magic has repaired most of the damage to the cities of Aundair, but the countryside remains scarred by the war, especially along the border with Thrane. The Crying Fields are a region of farmlands permanently scarred by magic and haunted by restless spirits. Aundairians claim their nation is stronger than ever, but some worry about the long-term impact of the loss of the Eldeen farmlands and the Crying Fields.

Now, Aundairians debate over differing views of their nation's future. Some believe the first focus should be reuniting Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force. Others consider Thaliost to be the pressing issue. And still others support Queen Aurala's claim to the throne of Galifar. When creating an Aundairian, consider whether you have ties to any of the affected regions and if this influences your opinion of Thranes or druids.

## Breland

**Capital**: Wroat

**Hallmarks**: Espionage, industry, metalwork, organized crime, subterfuge

In the wake of the Last War, Breland is one of the most powerful nations in Khorvaire. Possessing a large population and abundant resources, Breland leads the continent in industry.

The Brelish are known for their pragmatism and independence. They lack the discipline of Karrns and the faith of the Thranes, but they excel at finding innovative solutions to problems. The Brelish also have a talent for intrigue and subterfuge. The King's Dark Lanterns is one of the finest intelligence agencies in Khorvaire, rivaled only by House Phiarlan and the Trust of Zilargo. The dark side of these aptitudes is a strong streak of cynicism, which allows crime and corruption to flourish in Brelish cities and temples. The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, but in general the Brelish aren't as devout as citizens of other nations.

King Boranel ir'Wynarn rules Breland in conjunction with an elected parliament. Boranel is a popular leader celebrated for his exploits during the Last War, but his children have yet to prove themselves, and a growing movement advocates for abandoning royal rule when Boranel passes.

### Interesting Things About Breland

- Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire. Almost a nation in its own right, the City of Towers is a hub for commerce and intrigue. Chapter 3 provides more information on Sharn.  
- The Boromar Clan is the oldest and most powerful criminal organization in Breland. The Boromar halfling leadership maintains ties to the Talenta Plains. Other notable criminal organizations include the monsters of Daask and House Tarkanan, an alliance of assassins and thieves with aberrant dragonmarks (see "chapter 4" for more about these crime syndicates).  
- Breland's major cities are highly cosmopolitan. Due to its proximity to Droaam, Breland's cities include more monsters—ogres, orcs, goblins, and even sahuagin, harpies, and gargoyles—than elsewhere in the Five Nations.  

### Brelish Characters

As you develop a Brelish character or NPC, consider the following qualities:

**Slightly Shady**. Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places. Backgrounds such as criminal, spy, or charlatan can reflect this tendency, regardless of your class. You could also be a folk hero who challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an entertainer who plays in every dive in Sharn.

**Innovative and Independent**. Find your own path in the world; don't simply follow established traditions. As a cleric, you might challenge your church and follow your own divine revelations. As a wizard, you could search for new techniques or attempt to unravel forgotten secrets.

**Practical**. Whether it's about fashion, food, or conversation, the Brelish tend to be pragmatic. Why spend a fortune on a fancy meal when a simple one will do? You use whatever tool gets the job done, and you don't see a need for unnecessary flair.

### Cities and Sites

Beyond the magnificence of Sharn, Breland hosts a vast spectrum of other wonders.

#### Argonth

The floating fortress of Breland, Argonth is one of the marvels of the Last War. The product of House Cannith ingenuity and Brelish industrial might, Argonth is the largest engine of war ever built. This moving city is home to thousands of soldiers. Currently Argonth patrols the edge of the Mournland, but if tensions rise with Droaam or Darguun, the fortress can be deployed to reinforce a threatened border.

As a Brelish soldier or spy, you might have served aboard Argonth for a time before some incident led you to become an adventurer.

#### Black Pit

A massive chasm in the Blackcap Mountains, the Black Pit is over a mile across and descends beyond the limits of sight. It's said to be an entrance to the abyss of Khyber, and foul creatures live among the caves that honeycomb its walls. A nearby village—also called Black Pit—provides a haven for deserters and other criminals as well as a thriving black market.

If you have shady friends, you've likely heard of Black Pit's reputation as a place to quietly "disappear." Similarly, if you have ties to the King's Dark Lanterns, you know where to find some of Breland's worst criminals.

#### New Cyre

What began as a refugee camp has evolved into a struggling town hosting thousands of Cyran refugees. Prince Oargev holds court in New Cyre, considering himself a king in exile. Though resources are scarce, New Cyre remains a symbol of hope for many refugees. It's also a last stop for those determined to explore the Mournland.

#### Sharn

The City of Towers is described in chapter 3. Law and chaos dance on a knife's edge here, one never truly gaining advantage over the other.

#### Vathirond

Throughout the Last War, this town was beset by armies from Thrane, Cyre, and Karrnath. Vathirond's residents still hold grudges against these close foreign neighbors. However, their attention of late has been focused on the Mournland. Nameless horrors have begun to slip into Breland from the east at an alarming rate, and Brelish soldiers and adventurers stationed in Vathirond are usually the first to contend with these threats.

#### Wroat

Built on both sides of the Howling River at a point where the river widens, the ancestral seat of the rulers of Breland seduces visitors with its tree-lined avenues, elegant drawbridges, cleanliness, and laid-back atmosphere. Perched on a rocky island in the middle of the river, surrounded by military docks and barracks, is Brokenblade Castle, the king's stern fortress.

In contrast to its welcoming countenance, Wroat casts dark shadows, and much goes on quietly behind closed doors. The absence of beggars and riffraff in the streets might also raise suspicion that Wroat is putting on appearances. The King's Dark Lanterns are ever vigilant here, and newcomers who aim to misbehave tend to disappear quickly and without so much as a whisper.

### Aftermath of the Last War

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—Winter Palace under siege
> 
> Although untouched by a century of war, the Winter Palace suffered an attack from an unexpected quarter: the people of Breland. The so-called Swords of Liberty have taken credit for a daring raid that left the east wing of the palace in flames. No members of the Brelish royal family were in attendance during the attack.
> 
> The Swords of Liberty call for the violent overthrow of the Wynarn monarchy, demanding that all power be invested in the Brelish parliament. Their manifesto draws on the speeches of Lord Ruken ir'Clarn, but Lord Ruken has condemned their action. "No victory is possible when Brelish fight Brelish," he said in Wroat. "But I hope King Boranel can see that the time for change is upon us and help us navigate a peaceful transition of power before any more innocents are hurt."
^the-sharn-inquisitivewinter-palace-under-siege

For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and alliances. Breland fought Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane at various points of the war, as well as clashing with Darguun and Droaam. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.

The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including Wroat and Sharn—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of Vathirond is still repairing the damage from Thrane attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.

Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.

## Cyre (The Mournland)

**Capital**: Metrol (destroyed)

**Previous Hallmarks**: Art, artifice, jewelry, music, oratory, philosophy

**Current Hallmarks**: Destruction, ruins

Destroyed at the end of the Last War, Cyre now exists only in the hearts of the refugees scattered across Khorvaire.

Before the war, Cyre was the seat of the kings and queens of Galifar. The wealth of the kingdom flowed through Cyre, and it was a nexus for commerce and culture. By tradition, Cyre's Princess Mishann had the rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Cyrans take pride that they alone were in the right in the Last War, but they unquestionably lost more to the war than any other nation. As a Cyran, you stand on the moral high ground, but that may offer little comfort.

Cyrans like to say that their culture represented the best that Galifar had to offer, which is to say a little bit of everything. Cyrans value diversity and versatility, both in talents and thought. Cyre couldn't match Karrnath in martial discipline or Aundair in the arcane arts, but the flexibility of its forces reflected the nation's ideals.

Although the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of Cyre, the Silver Flame had a significant following. Many survivors question their faith in the wake of the Mourning, but some believe that their anguish at the loss of their homeland is a divine trial, prompting them to cling to their faith more than ever.

Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning and is presumed dead. Her son, Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, holds court in New Cyre, a massive refugee camp set up in Breland. Some refugees support Oargev and the dream of a restored Cyre, while others prefer to focus on the future instead of trying to reclaim the past. As a Cyran, you should decide whether you hold tight to your national identity, or instead consider yourself to be an expatriate without a nation.

### Interesting Things About Cyre (The Mournland)

- Cyre was the ancestral seat of the dragonmarked House Cannith, the house of Making. The house maintained arcane workshops across Cyre. Who knows what treasures wait in Cannith vaults for those who brave the dangers of the Mournland?  
- While not as flamboyant as Aundairians, Cyran fashions involved bright colors and [glamerweave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/glamerweave-erlw.md) (see "chapter 5"). Some Cyrans have made a point of continuing this custom. Others wear clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black; this has become known as Mourning wear.  
- Stories say communities of warforged live in the Mournland, including the insurgent called [the Lord of Blades](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/the-lord-of-blades-erlw.md).  

### Cyran Characters

When creating a character from Cyre, consider the following questions:

**What Have You Lost?** Did you lose wealth or status? Did you have family or loved ones killed in the Mourning? Did you lose something you could one day recover from the Mournland—arcane research, an heirloom artifact, or a precious family relic? Consider the impact the disaster has on your background. As a Cyran noble or soldier, your estates have been lost and your army scattered, but you still have the respect of your comrades or peers.

**What Do You Hold Onto?** Do you have a trinket that embodies Cyre for you? Is your wand or weapon an heirloom of your family? As an entertainer or guild artisan, do you preserve a particular Cyran tradition?

**What Drives You**? Are you determined to solve the mystery of the Mourning? Do you want to help other refugees, or are you concerned only with your personal survival? Is there something you want to recover from the Mournland, or would you prefer to never set foot in Cyre again? Do you hold a grudge against the nations that fought against Cyre in the war, or are you solely concerned with the future?

### Cities and Sites

Cyre was devastated by the Mourning. Its ruins have become grim reminders of the folly of war. Unknown threats both magical and monstrous haunt the Mournland. For more about the Mournland as it stands now, see "chapter 4".

#### Eston

Once the seat of House Cannith, this was a place of wonders—a city where "magic comes to life." Marvels of the city included the Clockwork Menagerie, showcasing the golems and homunculi made by generations of artificers; production facilities that housed three creation forges (see "chapter 5"), and the miraculous Steel Gardens, an early breakthrough that paved the way for the living warforged. If you're an artificer or have ties to House Cannith, you might have roots in Eston.

#### Metrol

Once the capital of Galifar, Metrol was known as the Rising City, for many of its buildings stood atop soaring columns of rock that dared to scrape the heavens. The Cathedral of the Sovereign Host was the center for followers of that faith. The Vault served as the mint and treasury of Galifar, containing cultural treasures deemed too valuable to be displayed; salvagers dream of finding this "golden palace." Floating gardens orbited the towering Royal Vermishard. Now lost, the beauty of Metrol lives only in Cyran memory.

#### Seaside

A coastal town in southern Cyre, Seaside was a popular vacation spot even during the war. While not as celebrated a destination as Stormhome in Aundair, the memory of Seaside has become an iconic image of peace and tranquility for the people of Cyre.

### Aftermath of the Last War

No nation won the Last War, but Cyre unquestionably lost it. Other nations are recovering from the conflict, but Cyre is gone. The lands not destroyed in the Mourning were lost decades earlier to Darguun and Valenar. Cyrans who survived the war must now carve out a new destiny in the lands of their enemies or in foreign nations beyond what was once the Kingdom of Galifar.

In creating a Cyran character, first determine how you survived the Mourning. Were you outside Cyre when it occurred, or did you somehow escape the destruction? Where did you take shelter? Breland has taken in refugees and created refugee camps. Thrane also accepted refugees but has worked to disperse and integrate them into the general population. Are you grateful or bitter? Do you have family or friends in refugee camps, or are you a lone survivor? Other Cyrans sought opportunities on the frontiers, settling in the jungles of Q'barra or seeking a new life in the distant land of Xen'drik.

Many Cyran survivors are soldiers, veterans stationed on the front lines when the Mourning occurred. If multiple members of your party are Cyrans, you might have served together during the Last War. Because Cyrans are so widely dispersed, you can encounter former comrades or friends anywhere in Khorvaire.

Since Cyrans lost their lands, the distinctions between peasant and aristocrat have become moot. Even with a criminal background, you might have been a viscount in Cyre; your background reflects your current standing and the resources you can call upon in the present.

## Darguun

**Capital**: Rhukaan Draal

**Hallmarks**: Dungeons, goblinoid mercenaries, ruins

Goblins and their kin have always been part of Khorvaire. Their ancient empire spread across the lands now held by other nations, and goblin foundations still stand underneath many human cities. This empire collapsed into savagery, and when humans arrived from Sarlona, they drove the goblins from their ancestral lands. Thus, goblins have long been a disenfranchised people, living in the shadows of newer nations or in wild lands shunned by humans.

The land now called Darguun was once part of Cyre. The hobgoblin clans known as the Ghaal'dar were based in the Seawall Mountains, but during the war, the demand for mercenaries drew an ever-increasing number of goblins out of the mountains to fight for Cyre and Breland. Late in the war, a brilliant hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor recognized that the goblins had become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal'dar under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to protect. The Five Nations were unprepared, and Breland quickly negotiated an alliance with Haruuc to secure the border. Cyre fought the goblins until the Day of Mourning, but the majority of delegates involved in forging the Treaty of Thronehold chose to recognize the new nation of Darguun to ensure peace.

Darguun is a young and volatile nation, ruled by Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. Haruuc remains a brilliant strategist and tactician, but many wonder whether he can maintain the web of alliances that hold the Ghaal'dar together, and whether he and his people will be content to abide by the terms of the treaty. Other goblins still hidden in the mountains—the enigmatic Heirs of Dhakaan (see "chapter 4")—could pose a threat both to the goblins and the rest of Khorvaire.

Traditionally, the Ghaal'dar worshiped a form of the Dark Six. House Deneith introduced the Sovereign Host to the region, and some goblins have embraced this faith, especially the gods Dol Dorn, Dol Arrah, and Balinor.

### Interesting Things About Darguun

- House Deneith has a strong presence in Darguun. No one will employ goblin armies in the wake of Haruuc's betrayal, but security forces value smaller units of goblinoid mercenaries for their ferocity and skills.  
- Darguun is a frontier nation. Although recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, it doesn't abide by the common laws of the treaty nations. Law enforcement is unpredictable, and acts considered criminal in other nations are part of life in Darguun.  
- A number of bugbear-dominated clans known as the Marguul inhabit southern Darguun. Some of the Marguul refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins; these clans are especially dangerous and violent.  
- Lhesh Haruuc united the Ghaal'dar clans and seized control of Darguun nearly three decades ago. If you are a non-goblin from this land, you may have been born in captivity. Were you forced into bondage, or did you adopt Darguul customs and earn a place in their society?  

### Darguul Characters

Darguun is a logical point of origin for goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear characters. When creating a Ghaal'dar character from Darguun, consider the following:

**Constant Struggle**. Among the Ghaal'dar, you must constantly prove your strength and skill to gain and hold the respect of your kin. Ghaal'dar rarely kill in a casual battle; you might fight to prove a point but kill only when you must.

**Loyal to Your Clan.** Challenge your peers as you like in times of peace, but when blades unsheathe for war, you stand by your clan—or those allies you have bonded with—until death. This loyalty doesn't extend to warriors of other Ghaal'dar clans.

**Muut and Atcha**. Your ancestors once forged an empire even greater than Galifar. Perhaps you believe that your people can reclaim this lost glory. The Dhakaani were renowned for their martial skill and their discipline. *Muut* roughly translates to "duty"—your duty to your empire, your clan, and your commander. Muut is expected; if you have no muut, you have no place in battle. *Atcha* corresponds to "honor," especially your personal honor gained by virtuous deeds that transcend the expectations of muut.

### Cities and Sites

Thirty years ago, this region was part of Cyre. The goblins converted towns and villages and raised new settlements, but many ruins and abandoned farms remain. The region is also peppered with dungeons dating back to the ancient goblin empire; these can be found in the vast Torlaac Moor or beneath the Khraal rainforest.

#### The Gathering Stone

This fortress enclave of House Deneith serves as a staging area for goblin mercenaries who wish to work for the house. It provides a stable and secure haven for travelers passing through the region, provided you're on good terms with House Deneith.

#### Gorgonhorn

This fortified village lies close to the Mournland. Once it maintained the front line against Cyre. Now, the hobgoblins stationed here protect their people from the horrors that crawl out of the warped realm. If you're a goblin soldier, you might have served in Gorgonhorn. It's also a base for the scavengers and salvagers who venture into the Mournland.

#### Lyrenton

Once a thriving Cyran town, Lyrenton is a ruin on the very edge of the Mournland. It's shunned by the Ghaal'dar, who believe it to be cursed. At night, a terrible wailing that echoes among the ruins can be heard for miles across the plains.

#### Rhukaan Draal

The largest city in Darguun serves as the seat of Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. As the hub for trade, travel, and diplomacy, it also a provides a haven for fugitives and smugglers. Lhesh Haruuc dwells in a fortress known as Khaar Mbar'ost, the Red House.

#### Wyvernskull

If you're a Ghaal'dar sailor or guild artisan, this small city—Darguun's primary seaport—could be your home. The goblinoids who live here are a sociable, rowdy lot who are also, by and large, friendly toward strangers.

![Dhakaani Ruins in the Seawall Mountains](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/072-2-04.webp#center)

### Aftermath of the Last War

Darguun was born in the Last War, and the scars of its birth are still raw. Most of the Cyran population fled the goblin uprising, and those who remained were killed or enslaved. As a result, many burnt-out farms and abandoned villages have stood empty for decades. The broken paths of the lightning rail make travel into the interior difficult, and only the largest cities offer the basic services common elsewhere in the treaty nations.

Any significant settlement is likely the domain of a single Ghaal'dar clan. While these clans give their fealty to Lhesh Haruuc, every clan lord holds absolute power in their town. Some clans are friendly to outsiders and welcome commerce. Others despise non-goblins. Lhesh Haruuc has abolished slavery in Rhukaan Draal, but some of clan lords continue this practice.

Overall, Darguun is a nation that is still finding its identity—a kingdom that seeks to be more than a seized territory. The goblins carry the legacy of a mighty empire and stand in the shadow of the nations around them. Haruuc wants to draw out the best in his people, to harness their strengths and achieve their potential. The rest of Khorvaire waits to see if the Ghaal'dar have the will to remain a nation, and if Darguun can survive when Haruuc passes away.

## Demon Wastes

**Capital**: None

**Hallmarks**: Fiends, pestilence

Rivers of lava cut across plains of black sand and volcanic glass. The only vegetation consists of blood-red moss and a thick layer of shimmering slime. A jagged rock formation might be a piece of an ancient wall, if you stretch your imagination.

Tens of thousands of years ago, fiends ruled Khorvaire. The Demon Wastes held the seat of power for some of the mightiest archfiends, home to cities of rakshasas and demons. Most of these foul entities perished or fled long ago, but a few still linger in this place even as new ones crawl up from the depths of Khyber. A handful of primordial ruins sustained by dark magic dot the bleak landscape—ruins that may still be home to fiends and their treasures.

The Stone Cage, Shadowcrags, and Icehorn Mountains separate the Demon Wastes from the Eldeen Reaches. A series of canyons known as the Labyrinth further separate the Demon Wastes from the rest of Khorvaire. Due to ancient warding magic, any creature that wishes to leave must do so through the Labyrinth. These passes are guarded by the Ghaash'kala, tribes of orcs sworn to contain the evils of the Wastes. Beyond the Labyrinth, the mortal inhabitants of the Demon Wastes include a brutal people known as the Carrion Tribes. Each tribe is devoted to an archfiend, and they engage in endless battles against the Ghaash'kala and the other Carrion Tribes.

If you're creating a character from the Demon Wastes, you're likely associated with either the Ghaash'kala or one of the Carrion Tribes.

### Interesting Things About the Demon Wastes

- A variety of fiends inhabit the Wastes, including devils, rakshasas, and demons. These creatures are spawned by Khyber, not the Outer Planes.  
- The Demon Wastes are riddled with portals to abyssal demiplanes, unearthly realms populated by fiends and other horrors. These inner realms include vast and twisted forests, living oceans, realms of rusted iron, and stranger places.  

### Ghaash'kala Characters

The Ghaash'kala are primarily orcs, but their numbers include a few half-orcs and members of other races. They devote their lives to guarding the Labyrinth and containing the evils of the Wastes. When creating a Ghaash'kala character, consider the following:

**The Binding Flame**. The Ghaash'kala worship Kalok Shash, the "Binding Flame." Fundamentally the same religion as the Silver Flame, Kalok Shash is a harsh faith that requires all able-bodied folk to fight in the endless war against the forces of darkness.

**Sacred Champions**. As a Ghaash'kala, you are a champion of the Binding Flame. A paladin sworn to the Oath of Vengeance, a barbarian on the Path of the Zealot (found in "Xanathar's Guide to Everything"), and a cleric of the Light or War domain all represent a logical path for a Ghaash'kala character. Outlander and hermit are appropriate backgrounds, reflecting your harsh upbringing or religious devotion.

### Carrion Tribes

The Carrion Tribes descend from explorers and refugees twisted by the evil in this realm. Explorers usually encounter these savage folk as enemies, but occasionally a hero emerges from the shadows. When creating a character from the Carrion Tribes, consider the following:

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/073-2-05.webp#center)

**Sworn to an Overlord.** Your tribe is devoted to an archfiend. This can serve as the roots of a warlock's pact or the inspiration for a barbarian's rage. Are you still loyal to your dark lord, or did you break free from its influence? Either way, work with the DM to develop the details of your overlord.

**Child of a Savage Land.** You were born into a lawless realm where violence was the only constant. How have you adapted to life on the other side of the Labyrinth? Are you superstitious, refusing to adapt to this new world, or are you doing your best to learn the ways of this strange realm?

**Why Did You Leave?** You began your life as a servant of darkness. Have you embraced the light? Are you fighting the servants of your former master? Or are you a pawn in a conflict between overlords? You might serve an evil force, but the cultists you fight serve even darker powers.

### Cities and Sites

Settlements are few and far between in the Demon Wastes. The Carrion Tribes are semi-nomadic, assembling camps in the crumbling ruins of long-forgotten cities built by demons in the first days of the world.

#### Ashtakala

Legends say that a single city of fiends remains intact. Stories describe Ashtakala as a city of basalt and brass, filled with rakshasas and demons. If it exists, it is shielded by powerful wards. Who knows what ancient artifacts and treasures it might contain?

#### Blood Crescent

House Tharashk established this tiny port at the end of the Last War. The house hopes to gain access to the dragonshard deposits buried in the Wastes. To date, it has survived the Carrion Tribes and the malefic horrors of the Wastes, but few believe it will last.

#### Desolate

Known at various times as Greenholt, Newholt, or Kymar's Folly, this outpost has served as an Aundairian settlement, a Thrane hermitage, and an outpost of House Lyrandar. It's fallen three times, and no one knows exactly how. Each time, its inhabitants have vanished in a single night, leaving all their possessions behind. Today it's known as Desolate, and it awaits the next band of settlers willing to stake their claim.

## Droaam

> [!readaloud] The Korranberg Chronicle—Descent into Droaam: my trail to terror
> 
> *We're all going to die.* That thought echoed through my mind as the wagon carried us toward the Great Crag. The diplomats around me intended to speak with the Daughters of Sora Kell. All I could think about was the stories my grandmother used to tell me. *Sora Maenya can crush a giant with her bare hands. She can eat the whole creature and still be hungry. If you're bad, she'll come in the night and carry you away. She'll make a lantern of your skull and torment you until the end of time.* And she's the *least* frightening member of the Daughters of Sora Kell!
> 
> When I could set aside my sheer terror, I was learning a great deal about this strange nation. The Daughters invested power in warlords, each of whom rules a territory in their name. It's sort of like Karrnath, except each of the warlords of Droaam is a horrifying monster. We were traveling through the territory of the Prince of Bones, an ancient troll said to be too evil to die. We'd already passed through the domain of Queen Sheska the medusa, where even the trees are turning to stone. Harpies. Gargoyles. There's even a king of the kobolds. Our caravan was being protected by gnolls. Not protected *from* gnolls, protected *by* gnolls. I thought things couldn't get any stranger. I couldn't have been more wrong....
^the-korranberg-chronicledescent-into-droaam-my-trail-to-terror

**Capital**: The Great Crag

**Hallmarks**: Byeshk ore, monstrous mercenaries

Droaam is a nation of monsters ruled by the Daughters of Sora Kell. Each of these three hags is a legend in her own right, the subjects of tales used to frighten children. Eleven years ago, they seized the lands west of the Graywall Mountains and founded the nation of Droaam.

Although Breland laid claim to these barren lands, Galifar had never tamed this wild region. Gnolls, orcs, and goblins commonly sought haven here, as well as ogres, trolls, harpies, minotaurs, medusas, tieflings, changelings, lycanthropes, and other races unwelcome in civilized lands. In the past, these creatures fought one another more often than they raided human settlements. Under the leadership of the Daughters of Sora Kell, they have new purpose. The Daughters use an army of ogres and war trolls to maintain order.

To date, the other nations of Khorvaire have refused to recognize Droaam, and the region was not acknowledged in the Treaty of Thronehold. Most people believe that the monstrous nation can't last—that even the Daughters can't hold the disparate alliance together—but Droaam is currently thriving and stronger than ever.

Droaam works closely with House Tharashk, selling the services of monstrous soldiers and laborers and byeshk ore, a form of metal with magical properties. Beyond that, it's a still-expanding frontier nation. The cities of Graywall and Great Crag grow larger and more organized every day, and the rest of Khorvaire is uneasy with the potential power of a fully realized Droaam.

The monsters that inhabit Droaam retain their racial subcultures. Most worship the Dark Six, but other religious traditions flourish as well.

### Interesting Things About Droaam

- Droaam uses the supernatural abilities of its citizens as tools, just as other nations of Khorvaire use magic. The Daughters of Sora Kell keep their people fed with troll sausage and use harpy's song to quell brawls. When dealing with monsters in Droaam, consider the practical applications of their abilities.  
- When the Church of the Silver Flame purged lycanthropy from the Five Nations, a number of lycanthropes escaped into the region that later become Droaam. The Dark Pack alliance of lycanthropes, worgs, and other supernatural predators hunts southern Droaam.  

### Droaamite Characters

Minotaurs, orcs, gnolls, tieflings, changelings, and other monstrous species all have a place in Droaam. Consider these questions when making a Droaamite character:

**What Makes You Different?** The people of Droaam aren't just humans with horns or green skin. Think about the unique aspects of your people and what makes you different from humanity, both physically and culturally.

**What Are Your Ambitions?** Citizens of Droaam are proud of their nation. You know that the rest of Khorvaire considers you a monster. Do you intend to prove that you and your kind are capable of deeds humanity can't imagine? Or are you driven solely by your personal desires, or the goals of your family or warlord?

**How Does Your Background Shape You?** The diverse creatures of Droaam could include a kobold city-savvy rogue urchin, an orc outlander barbarian with little knowledge of the outside world, or a tiefling warlock sage versed in [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) and [History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History).

### Cities and Sites

In the past, particular creatures dominated the communities of Droaam. The harpy flights lived in mountain peaks, while the medusas remained isolated in the citadel of Cazhaak Draal. Under the rule of the Daughters of Sora Kell, the Droaamites are creating cities where all manner of creatures live and work together.

#### Graywall

Known as the Gateway to Droaam, this city sits on the border to Breland. Though dominated by monsters and ruled by a mind flayer, Graywall is both a center for trade and a haven for deserters and fugitives. The dragonmarked houses maintain outposts in Graywall, and House Tharashk governs the Calabas, the foreign quarter inhabited by humans and other people from elsewhere in Khorvaire.

#### The Great Crag

Built atop ancient goblin ruins, the Crag is the seat of the Daughters of Sora Kell. Few outsiders have seen this thriving city of monsters. Of the dragonmarked houses, only House Tharashk has a presence in the city.

#### The Venomous Demesne

This hidden city is ruled by families of tiefling warlocks who wield powerful magic and craft dark wonders. If you're playing a tiefling or a warlock, you could have ties to the Venomous Demesne.

### Aftermath of the Last War

Droaam is barely a decade old. The treaty nations refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty; according to the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, it's a rebellious territory of Breland. As a renegade nation, it is a haven for war criminals and deserters, as well as brigands and mages pursuing forbidden paths of magic. The monsters of Droaam have no particular love for these bandits and fugitives, and outlanders have to watch their step.

Tensions remain high on the border with Breland, resulting in constant skirmishes and raids. Deeper within the nation, the Daughters of Sora Kell build their power. Graywall and the Great Crag are constantly expanding, with goblins and ogres laboring through the night. Warlords drill their troops, forcing all manner of monsters to work together. A predatory aspect permeates life in Droaam but also a sense of excitement, the belief that the Daughters will lead Droaam to greatness. For centuries the people of Droaam have hidden in the shadows; now they stand in the light, and they are proud.

## Eldeen Reaches

**Capital**: Greenheart

**Hallmarks**: Agriculture, animal husbandry, druidic magic

A stretch of fertile farmlands borders a vast, untamed forest. Farmers tend the fields, while tribes of shifters and circles of druids and rangers roam through the woods. These are the Eldeen Reaches.

Druids and shifters dwelled in the Towering Wood for thousands of years, but the eastern farmlands of the Reaches were part of Aundair until the Last War. The lords of Aundair focused their resources on the war effort, ignoring banditry and other problems faced by the farmers of the east. The Wardens of the Wood—largest of the druid sects—came to the aid of these farmers. Fifty years ago, the people of eastern Aundair seceded and formed the Eldeen Reaches. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized the Reaches as a nation, but its citizens fear Aundair will try to reclaim the region.

Druidic magic is central to life in the Eldeen Reaches. Its people seek to live in harmony with the natural world, and each community has a druidic advisor who helps with planning and planting. The Towering Wood is also home to tribes of shifters, who maintain a nomadic existence. The Wardens of the Wood uphold order and settle disputes, and the Great Druid Oalian—an awakened greatpine—is the spiritual leader of the Reaches.

### Interesting Things About the Eldeen Reaches

- The Towering Wood is vast and untamed. The Wardens of the Wood seek to protect travelers, but swathes of forest remain entirely untouched by human or shifter. Such areas could hold giant beasts never seen in the outside world, or relics from a previous age—artifacts or ruins created by demons or the terrifying daelkyr.  
- The fey have a strong presence in the Towering Wood. Even outside the fey stronghold of the Twilight Demesne, manifest zones tied to Thelanis (see "chapter 4") allow passage between worlds. The Eldeen Reaches are a logical origin for a character with ties to the fey.  
- Druidic magic is a vital tool in the Eldeen Reaches. Residents use animal messengers to carry communications between villages, and beasts perform vital services. [Goodberry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/goodberry.md) wine takes the place of House Vadalis healing. Communities include awakened animals and plants as members.  

### Eldeen Characters

When creating an Eldeen character or NPC, consider the following:

**Farm or Forest**? Did you grow up on one of the farms of the eastern Reaches, or did you spend your childhood in the Towering Wood? Are you comfortable in buildings, or do you prefer the open air? As a child of the forest, you might take the outlander background, or perhaps you became a folk hero by defending farmers from bandits and beasts.

**Natural Magic**. Druidic traditions play an important role in Eldeen society. If you're a druid or ranger, are you a stoic Warden of the Wood or a grim Child of Winter? Even if you're not a spellcaster, the Magic Initiate feat can provide you with a few spells to reflect a basic initiation into the druidic mysteries.

**A Land with No Lords.** The Reachers are fiercely independent. They broke with Aundair, and they bow to no monarch. The folk of the Reaches value talent over titles. The Eldeen people respect the guidance of the druids, but they all work together to solve their problems; no one gives orders to a Reacher.

### Cities and Sites

Most people of the Eldeen Reaches live in villages and on farms. Some folk in the Towering Wood make their homes in the vast trees, while others are wanderers.

#### The Gloaming

This region of the Towering Wood has strong ties to the sinister Plane of Mabar (see "chapter 4"). It's charged with negative energy, and undead and other malevolent creatures lurk in its shadows.

#### Greenheart

The grove of the Archdruid Oalian, the awakened greatpine, is a place of great primal power. The Wardens of the Wood are based around Greenheart, but all the druid circles of the Eldeen Reaches send emissaries to Greenheart when they have important matters to discuss.

#### The Twilight Demesne

Located within the Towering Wood, the Twilight Demesne has close ties to the Faerie Court of Thelanis (see "chapter 4"). Fey abound in this forest, and those who wander within may stumble upon the City of Rose and Thorn, the domain of a powerful archfey called the King of Summer. If you're playing a character with ties to the fey, the Twilight Demesne could be your home.

#### Varna

The largest city in the Reaches serves as the gateway for commerce with the world beyond. Reacher merchants come from far and wide to sell their goods in the markets of Varna. All the dragonmarked houses have outposts in Varna, but as the ancestral seat of House Vadalis it houses their largest enclave.

![Planar Observatory in the Eldeen Reaches](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/074-2-06.webp#center)

### Aftermath of the Last War

The farmers of the eastern Eldeen seceded from Aundair during the Last War, and tensions between the two nations remain high. Most Reachers believe it's only a matter of time until Aundair tries to reclaim the region, and every village has a militia ready to serve.

The people of the Reaches value hospitality and regard all people as equals, but the fear of Aundairian aggression can cause Reachers to treat foreigners with suspicion or hostility.

## Karrnath

**Capital**: Korth

**Hallmarks**: Ale, dairy, glass, livestock, lumber, martial discipline, paper, textiles, undead

In a nation of storms and long winters, the grim and stoic Karrns are accustomed to enduring hardship without complaint.

First and foremost, Karrnath is known for its military tradition. Strength, strategy, and discipline are the core values of Karrnath. Karrnath's soldiers might be the finest in Khorvaire, but they lack the magical support of Aundair or Thrane, which evened the odds during the Last War. Nonetheless, Karrns are proud of their martial history, and most are convinced that they would have eventually won the Last War.

Karrnath suffered a series of severe food shortages and plagues early in the Last War. As a result, the king embraced the Blood of Vol as the national religion. The priests of this faith bolstered Karrnath's forces with undead. The current king, Kaius ir'Wynarn III, broke ties with the Blood of Vol and has stopped creating new undead, but Karrnath still has a significant number of skeletons and zombies in service. Many Karrns still believe in the Blood of Vol and approve of the use of undead, but just as many feel that this practice disgraces Karrnath's proud military history and that the necromancers might have been responsible for the famines and plagues.

### Interesting Things About Karrnath

> [!readaloud] The Korranberg Chronicle—In the Thrall of the Vampire King
> 
> Kaius ir'Wynarn III emerged from the shadows like a villain in one of Kessler's plays. His guardians kept him hidden during his youth while his aunt Moranna served as the regent of Karrnath. So it was a surprise to many when he burst forth to claim his crown and his power, all the more so because of his uncanny resemblance to Kaius I, the ruler who plunged Karrnath into the Last War and instituted the brutal system of laws that bears his name.
> 
> Given the circumstances of Kaius III's ascension, it's hardly surprising that the new king would face challenges from the proud warlords of Karrnath. Some questioned his lineage and his ability to command. But the most unusual challenge came from the warlord Drago Thul: was Kaius III actually alive? Kaius I had elevated the Blood of Vol in Karrnath and instituted the use of undead as weapons of war. Drago Thul asserted that Kaius III was actually Kaius I, a vampiric monster "seeking to drain the lifeblood of Karrnath itself." This was a serious accusation; the undead have no rights under the Code of Galifar and cannot inherit titles or lands. Thul's challenge spread like wildfire, only to be crushed when Kaius III met the warlords under the midday sun and cut his palm to show his freely flowing blood.
> 
> This should have been the end of it, but the tale of the Vampire King has proven surprisingly resilient. Some say that the king developed special enchantments to avoid the effects of sunlight; others say that he has relies on changeling impersonators to take his place in the daylight. As for Drago Thul, he refused to stand down when Kaius III pushed for peace and the Treaty of Thronehold. He fled to the city of Stormreach in Xen'drik with a small band of followers, and he continues to rally support against "the monster that sits on our throne."
^the-korranberg-chroniclein-the-thrall-of-the-vampire-king

- Rekkenmark Academy is the premier military institute in Khorvaire; prior to the Last War, all of Galifar's officers trained at Rekkenmark.  
- The Sovereign Host has regained its place as the dominant religion of Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol retains a strong following. Communities that practice the faith still use skeletons and zombies as guards or laborers.  
- The laws of Karrnath are harsher than those in other treaty nations, approaching a state of martial law.  

### Karrnathi Characters

Karrns are somber folk and disapprove of extravagance or excessive shows of emotion. As you develop a Karrnathi character or NPC, consider the following:

**Military Service**. Karrns have a strong tradition of military service, making soldier or sailor appropriate backgrounds for any character. Criminals and charlatans have a difficult time evading the harsh laws of Karrnath. The [Martial Adept](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/martial-adept.md) feat can give a character a strong sense of military experience.

**Martial Tradition**. Karrnathi tradition emphasizes teamwork, focus, and force, and melee warriors prefer heavy armor and weapons. Fighters favor the Champion and Battle Master martial archetypes, and Karrnathi wizards choose the School of Evocation or Necromancy as their arcane tradition.

**The Dead**. Undead soldiers have served in Karrnath's armies for decades. How do you feel about the undead? Are you a follower of the Blood of Vol who considers the undead to be a practical tool? Do you have a relative or friend currently serving? Or do you despise the Blood of Vol and the use of necromancy?

### Cities and Sites

Sturdy walls surround Karrnathi communities, and even the smallest village maintains a capable militia.

#### Atur

Known as the City of Night, Atur is the stronghold of the Blood of Vol in Karrnath. During the war, this was the center for the production of undead, and massive catacombs below the city hold legions of Karrnath's undead soldiers in case they are needed again.

#### Fort Bones

Fortresses such as this one dot the hilltops of Karrnath, watching for signs of enemy encroachment even since the Last War has ended. Fort Bones' garrison consists primarily of Karrnathi undead soldiers. No lights glow here, as these undead rely on [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) to see.

#### Karrlakton

The turbulent Cyre River separates this city from the deathly Mournland. Karrlakton is the birthplace of kings (both Karrn the Conqueror and Galifar I were born here) and is the center of power for House Deneith. The house's headquarters, Sentinel Tower, dominates the city's skyline. A stern edifice of angular stone, Sentinel Tower radiates martial authority and is one of the most heavily defended fortresses in Khorvaire. Surrounding the tower are training grounds, barracks, and smithies to accommodate all of House Deneith's needs. Sentinel Tower serves as the headquarters of the famed Sentinel Marshals, though most of them are abroad.

#### Korth

The capital of Karrnath is a city-fortress on the edge of the Nightwood and the seat of King Kaius III. Its walls and towers bristle with the weapons of war, and military marches through the city help bolster the spirits of the Karrns as well as intimidate foreign diplomats. The forges of Korth produce some of the finest armor and weapons in Khorvaire.

#### The Nightwood

This massive forest has close ties to the Plane of Mabar. Monsters sometimes slip out of the Nightwood to threaten the surrounding regions. Criminals and fugitives who flee into the Nightwood find the dangers within deadlier than any Karrnathi executioner.

![Fort Bones](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/075-2-07.webp#center)

### Aftermath of the Last War

Karrnath has always been a martial nation, and its people remain vigilant. Early in the war, King Kaius I instituted the Code of Kaius, a strict set of laws and limits. Karrnath weathered a number of famines during the war, and this privation led to an ongoing program of rationing to ensure that the nation is prepared for whatever lies ahead. The war is over, but the Code of Kaius and the rationing remains in place; the people of Karrnath willingly endure ongoing hardship to ensure that their future is secure. The populace frowns on excess of any sort, accepts limits on luxury items, and approves of swift and harsh punishments for crime.

King Kaius III was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold and remains committed to peace. However, many of the nation's warlords believe that Karrnath would have won the Last War and that Kaius denied the Karrnathi people their rightful destiny. Should these warlords gain sufficient support, they could push for a military coup.

A second destabilizing factor is the tension between the followers of the Blood of Vol and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead troops. The traditionalists claim that the dark magic of the Seekers caused famines and plagues, crippling Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the undead. The Blood of Vol could back an uprising in Karrnath, or those who wish to drive out the Seekers could trigger a civil war.

## Lhazaar Principalities

**Capital**: Regalport

**Hallmarks**: Fish, mercenaries, merchants, pirates, ships

This loose confederacy of pirate lords, merchant princes, and sea barons holds the northeastern coastline of Khorvaire and the many mist-shrouded islands scattered across it. Recognized as a single allied nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, the principalities are more of a loose alliance. Each island domain has its own values, goals, and feuds with other domains. The Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During the Last War, they served all nations as privateers and engaged in piracy on the side. When the war ended, they returned to the merchant trade, but pirates still hunt on the open seas.

The Lhazaar value their independence. Here, anyone can rise to captain a ship or even seize a principality. Leadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn of Regalport seeks to forge the principalities into a unified force. He has the finest fleet, and his efforts ensured that the principalities gained recognition at Thronehold, after which he awarded himself the title of High Prince. So far, the other princes have rejected his proposals for a stronger union.

Some principalities are devoted to the Blood of Vol and a few favor the Sovereign Host. Beyond these, the Lhazaar show little enthusiasm for religion, though many curse the Devourer when a storm comes.

### Interesting Things About the Lhazaar Principalities

- Rulership of the principalities is so fluid that it's possible for someone to start the day as a sailor and end it as a prince. A campaign could easily be based around a party of adventurers gaining a principality.  
- The Wind Whisperer principality includes a number of half-elves with the Mark of Storm—foundlings with no tie to House Lyrandar. The Wind Whisperers want to obtain airships by any means necessary.  
- The Lhazaar Principalities have the largest changeling population in Khorvaire. Many of them congregate in the Gray Tide, a domain founded by changelings.  

### Lhazaar Characters

As you develop a Lhazaar character or NPC, consider the following:

**Seafarers and Swashbucklers**. Most Lhazaar spend more time at sea than they do on land. Sailor is an appropriate background for any Lhazaar, but you can ask your DM if you can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.

**Local Customs**. Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with your DM to develop one that fits your character.

**Big Dreams**. Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always look to the future. What do you want? To find a forgotten treasure hoard? To command your own ship? To take your place as a prince? Think big and chase your dreams.

### Cities and Sites

Among the myriad ports and pirate redoubts of the Lhazaar Principalities are ancient ruins from forgotten civilizations that predate even the Dhakaani Empire, as well as tombs built by wealthy pirates and sea lords to house their treasures and earthly remains.

Presented below are a handful of the most widely known—if hard to find—places in the principalities.

#### Dreadhold

This island prison is said to be inescapable. Maintained by House Kundarak, Dreadhold houses a host of infamous criminals and political prisoners. Its vaults also hold some of the greatest treasures of House Kundarak.

#### Port Verge

Port Verge is the royal port of the Direshark Principality. Prince Kolberkon yearns to expand Verge and overshadow Regalport, and he is always looking for capable adventurers and allies. The Blood of Vol has a strong presence in Port Verge, and Kolberkon recently allowed House Lyrandar to establish an enclave there. But Kolberkon's thirst for glory may lead him to foolish bargains.

#### Regalport

The seat of the High Prince Ryger and the Seadragon Principality, Regalport is the grandest city in the principalities. The patriarch of House Thuranni resides in Regalport, and House Ghallanda has a significant outpost here. The Pirate Exchange is the largest market east of the Ironroot Mountains.

#### Trebaz Sinara

It's said that the legendary pirate queen Lhazaar made her home on Trebaz Sinara, and that this island holds the treasures and tombs of generations of sea lords. However, the island hasn't been seen in over five hundred years. Many Lhazaar sailors have devoted their lives to finding the legendary lost isle.

### Aftermath of the Last War

During the Last War, the Lhazaar served as privateers and pirates. Outsiders wonder if the principalities can adapt to peace, or if their thirst for gold and adventure will lead their subjects to ruin.

Most of the princes are content with their domains, but ambitious rulers such as Prince Ryger of Regalport and Prince Kolberkon of Port Verge could shatter the status quo. Kolberkon seeks to expand his personal power, while Ryger wants to forge a stronger unified nation. Both pursue dangerous alliances in their campaigns. In addition to agreements with the dragonmarked houses, rumors abound of bargains with dragons, fiends, and the distant Empire of Riedra. Will the dreams of these princes lead to a new war?

## Mror Holds

**Capital**: Krona Peak

**Hallmarks**: Banking, dwarves, metalwork, mining (precious and non-precious metals)

When humanity first came to Khorvaire, they found the dwarven clans of the Mror Holds locked in endless feuds. This division kept the clans from uniting against the new arrivals, and the dwarves were forced to swear fealty to Karrnath and Galifar. Over the centuries, they turned their energies to harnessing the astonishing natural resources of their mountain home. The dwarves were then reborn as merchant lords.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/076-2-08.webp#center)

In the early days of the Last War, Mror miners made an astonishing discovery: the ruins of an ancient dwarven empire, vast halls deep within the Ironroot Mountains. Explorers uncovered mines still brimming with jewels and precious ores and vaults filled with riches and powerful artifacts. The Mror restored these ancient fortresses and worked to reclaim the secrets of their ancestors. Seeing the untapped potential of the Realm Below and the broken Kingdom of Galifar, the clan lords joined together to form the Iron Council and to declare the independence and sovereignty of the Mror Holds.

One question remained: What had become of the ancient dwarves? The answer soon became apparent. As the Mror delved deeper into the Realm Below, they woke an ancient evil: [Dyrrn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/dyrrn-erlw.md) the Corruptor, a daelkyr lord of madness. Hordes of aberrations and derro rose from the depths to challenge the explorers. For decades, the Mror lords have been fighting a battle in the depths, struggling to drive the darkness from their ancestral halls. Many dwarves revile anything to do with the daelkyr. Others believe that the daelkyr can grant the Mror dwarves the power to overcome any enemy. Some clans have taken up symbionts and living weapons recovered from the depths, and cabals of warlocks draw on the power of the Plane of Xoriat (see "chapter 4").

The Mror Holds consist of a loose confederation. Twelve noble clans each govern a hold and have a representative on the Iron Council, which resolves disputes and issues affecting the entire nation. Each hold includes a number of lesser clans, who owe fealty to the noble line. Those who occupy land above have the right to claim the halls that lie below if they can.

The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the Mror Holds. Kol Korran is the most beloved of the Sovereigns, but the dwarves also revere Boldrei, Dol Dorn, Olladra, and Onatar.

### Interesting Things About the Mror Holds

- The Mror Holds contain deep reserves of gold, silver, and other rare and precious metals, along with iron and other ores. The Mror dwarves are skilled miners and artisans.  
- A clan of orcs called the Jhorash'tar live among the Ironroot Mountains. The Jhorash'tar have been slowly crowded into the least hospitable regions of the mountains. A few dwarven clans seek to incorporate the Jhorash'tar into Mror society, but others wish to drive them out once and for all.  
- The dwarves have recovered artifacts and arcane secrets from the Realm Below. Dwarf artificers are still working to master the techniques of their ancestors, while warlocks strive to harness the powers of the daelkyr. Mror communities are shaped by the artifacts they possess or by their interactions with the daelkyr. A Mror lord might serve guests from a bottomless cauldron of wine, while another studies strangers using a crown of eyes, claiming that this living artifact reveals all evil intent.  

### Mror Characters

As you develop a Mror character or NPC, consider the following:

**Clan Focus**. The dwarf clan is the heart of Mror culture. Is your clan known for mercantile power or martial skill? Are you a noble—even if you're a few steps removed from true power? Or are you a guild artisan or soldier? Most Mror have embraced modern martial techniques, but a few minor clans still cling to barbarian traditions of the past. What caused you to leave your hold? Are you serving your clan and honing your skills, or have you been exiled from your homeland?

**The Realm Below**. How has the Realm Below affected your family and your character? Do you oppose the foul forces that infest your ancestral halls, or do you see them as a source of power? You might be a paladin sworn to oppose the horrors that dwell in the deep, or you could be a warlock who's forged a pact with a Great Old One patron, one of the dark powers in the depths.

**Pride in Possessions**. From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you carry. If you find a magic weapon, you want to know the battles it has seen and the warriors who have wielded it before you. This is especially true of the relics recovered from the Realm Below. Who forged the blade you carry? Do you bear a trinket from a forgotten age?

### Cities and Sites

> [!readaloud] The Voice of Karrnath—Mror Holds: Birthplace of abomination!
> 
> It's been exactly seventy years since the Iron Council declared the Mror Holds' independence from Karrnath. King Kaius II was newly seated on the steel throne and lacked the resolve to bring the dwarf lords to heel. Now we see the harvest we have sown, and it is horrifying. Without the firm hand of Karrnath to keep them on a righteous path, the Mror dwarves have embraced foul powers.
> 
> Witness Lord Malus Soldorak, seen in Korth this week for trade negotiations. His breastplate was forged from chitin and muscle, and it seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. A guard present at the event said that Soldorak's axe moaned when the blade came close to him, as if the weapon hungered for human blood.
> 
> This is what springs from our mercy and forbearance. Who knows what horrors the dwarves are crafting—or breeding—in their mountain halls? We cannot stand by and let this vileness continue. For the good of our nation, we call on all true Karrns to demand that Regent Moranna unleash our full might on the Mror Holds and cleanse this horror!
^the-voice-of-karrnathmror-holds-birthplace-of-abomination

The Mror Holds spread across the Ironroot Mountains. Most Mror communities are at least partially subterranean, extending down into the mountains. The Realm Below is deep beneath the surface, and not every town has a passage to it.

#### Krona Peak

Located in the dwarven realm of Mroranonhold, Krona Peak serves as the seat of the Iron Council and thus is the Mror Holds' equivalent of a capital. This center of commerce provides a major connection to the western nations. Kol Korran's Throne, Khorvaire's largest temple to the Sovereign Lord of World and Wealth, dominates the cityscape.

#### Solangap

The holdfast of Clan Soldorak, Solangap boasts vast gold mines and the largest mint and treasury in Khorvaire. Clan Soldorak has recovered many daelkyr tools and weapons from the Realm Below. Solan lords proudly wear symbionts and make no effort to hide their warlock pacts.

#### Noldrunhold

Four hundred years ago, the dwarves of Clan Noldrun vanished. All expeditions that delved into Noldrunhold ended in disaster, and the region was declared to be cursed and shunned. At the time, the dwarves believed that the Jhorash'tar orcs were responsible, but now it seems more likely that the Noldrun opened a path to the Realm Below. What malevolent powers have claimed the halls of Noldrunhold?

#### The Realm Below

No one knows the extent or depth of the ancient dwarven empire deep beneath the Ironroot Mountains. Great wealth and arcane secrets remain hidden in these halls, along with endless hordes of aberrations. As a Mror adventurer, you could help your family reclaim lands from the Realm Below, or you could lead your allies into the deep in search of wealth and glory.

### Aftermath of the Last War

The Mror Holds declared independence during the Last War. Many nations depend on the resource of the Holds, and the Treaty of Thronehold affirmed its sovereignty.

To the casual observer, the Mror dwarves' star appears to be rising. Their mines seem to offer limitless resources. Mror artificers make amazing strides as they study the relics of their ancestors. The dwarves are proud of their ancient past and optimistic about the future. Most Mror are generous and courageous, eager to show off their wealth and accomplishments.

Those who dig deeper realize that this prosperity is built on an unstable foundation. The Last War may be over, but the war against the daelkyr has barely begun. The clan lords hold their reclaimed halls in the Realm Below, but no one knows the full extent of the power of the daelkyr. A renewed assault could come at any time, whether it's a force of monsters boiling up from below or a creeping madness that infects the weak-willed.

The dwarves are also divided by their attitude toward the aberrations. Some of the clans—notably Soldorak—embrace symbionts and other daelkyr gifts; some even experiment with flesh-warping techniques and create their own monsters. Others—notably Clan Mroranon—avoid contact with the aberrations. Such dwarves treasure the relics of their ancestors but despise those who use symbionts or form pacts with the darkness.

Long ago, the dwarves engaged in vicious feuds that kept them from uniting as a nation. This new divide could reignite those rivalries, leading to a civil war on the surface even as evil gains strength in the depths.

## Q'barra

**Capital**: Newthrone

**Hallmarks**: Eberron dragonshards, rare herbs

Q'barra is a young nation on the edge of Khorvaire, an untamed frontier filled with danger and opportunity. During the golden age of Galifar, few humans bothered to cross the Endworld Mountains to explore the vast jungle beyond. When the Last War broke out, a fleet of settlers came to Q'barra in search of a new home far from the war. As this settlement expanded, the settlers discovered massive deposits of Eberron dragonshards (see "chapter 5"). Over the past decade, a wave of prospectors, wandslingers, refugees, and fortune-seekers have descended on Q'barra, along with brigands, deserters from the war, and all manner of criminals and opportunists.

To their surprise, Q'barra was already home to a number of ancient civilizations humans know nothing about: the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation, the dragonborn of Ka'rhashan, and the confederacy of the Poison Dusk lizardfolk. Most settlers refer to them collectively as "scales." King Sebastes ir'Kesslan of Newthrone has established a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, but communication has been difficult and prospectors rarely abide by the terms of the treaty.

### Interesting Things About Q'barra

- Q'barra is one of the richest sources of Eberron dragonshards in Khorvaire, drawing waves of settlers and prospectors to this young and growing nation on the edge of civilization.  
- Certain ruins in Q'barra appear connected to the Age of Demons. The settlers know little of the history of this region, but the Poison Dusk lizardfolk have ties to fiendish powers.  
- House Tharashk has a strong presence in Q'barra. Tharashk is the primary buyer of Eberron dragonshards and also runs large-scale mining operations here.  

### Q'barran Characters

Q'barra tempts explorers from the west with the prospects of wealth and new lands to conquer—mostly humans but including members of all races found in Khorvaire. Settlers, dragonborn, and lizardfolk characters who originate here should consider the following:

**Settlers**. Q'barra is an excellent place to explore the traditional archetypes of the classic Western. As a paladin, you could be a lone sheriff seeking to protect your newly formed mining village. Your cleric could be the town preacher. As a sorcerer or bard with a criminal background, you could be a dashing wandslinger looking for trouble and gold.

**Renegades and Regrets**. Q'barra promises a land of opportunity and a place where you can leave your past behind. Are you a deserter? Were you convicted of a crime you didn't commit? Are you fleeing from a broken heart? Q'barra has also drawn Cyran refugees and newly freed warforged, both seeking a home in the wild east.

**Lizardfolk**. The lizardfolk's primitive culture blends druidic traditions with the beliefs of the Silver Flame. You might have been sent to study the softskins—to learn about them and potentially serve as an envoy for your people. Alternatively, you could be following a spiritual vision.

**Dragonborn**. The dragonborn live amid the remnants of ancient glory. They have a proud martial tradition, and a number of dragonborn venture west in search of worthy challenges. If you follow this path, you might have served as a mercenary in the Last War.

### Cities and Sites

Q'barra is split into three main regions. New Galifar is the original colony; it has a feudal structure and holds to the laws of the Treaty of Thronehold. To the north, Hope is a collection of small mining towns. In Hope, the law goes only as far as the people willing to enforce it. Beyond these human regions lie the unexplored lands of the scales.

#### Haka'torvhak

Explorers tell stories of a city hidden deep in the jungles of Q'barra—a wondrous citadel of obsidian and brass. According to these tales, the city is filled with treasure and guarded by a dragon fused with an ancient demon.

#### Newthrone

The capital of New Galifar and the seat of King Sebastes, Newthrone is the largest city and port in Q'barra. Myriad people from all over Khorvaire mingle here in crowded streets. Soldiers pay little heed to the rampant crime in these streets, viewing it instead as part of life in the port city.

#### Wyrmwatch

A thriving prospecting town in Hope, Wyrmwatch was established by Cyran refugees. Although far smaller than New Cyre in Breland, its people are proud of what they have built. The independent community is led by Elder Nevillom, a veteran and evangelist of the Silver Flame. Nevillom's courage and passionate sermons help sustain the people of Wyrmwatch in difficult times.

### Aftermath of the Last War

The influx of Cyran refugees promises to reshape Q'barra. Most of the settlers are peaceful people searching for a homes and opportunities, but some among them chose Q'barra over refugee camps because they refused to accept charity from former enemies. These "Mourners" rob and kill settlers from the nations that fought against Cyre. Hope also has its share of brigands and criminals, bandits who prey on House Tharashk convoys and settlers alike.

The relationship between the settlers and the natives is another source of tension. Although King Sebastes forged a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, the prospectors of Hope regularly violate this treaty. The Poison Dusk lizardfolk are hostile to both the settlers and the Cold Sun Federation. Conflicts between settlers and scales have escalated over the last four years, and many fear that worse is yet to come.

## Shadow Marches

**Capital**: Zarash'ak (unofficial)

**Hallmarks**: Eberron dragonshards, herbs

When most people think of the Shadow Marches, they imagine a fetid backwater where illiterate humans mingle with orcs and other foul creatures, practicing strange rites by the light of the moons. While flawed, this vision isn't entirely inaccurate. The Shadow Marches are a desolate land of swamps and moors. The homeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred in the ancient conflict with the daelkyr. The fiends left twisted creatures and aberrations in the swamps, and sowed seeds of madness that linger to this day. There are indeed moonlit rituals in the Marches: some to honor the daelkyr, others to maintain the wards that keep them trapped in Khyber.

Humans came to the Marches long ago, refugees fleeing a war in the distant land of Sarlona. Over time the two cultures merged, forming the Marches as they exist today.

The Marches had little contact with the Kingdom of Galifar or the east until a few hundred years ago, when a House Sivis expedition made two discoveries: the region contained valuable dragonshards, and a number of clans had manifested the Dragonmark of Finding. This led to the foundation of House Tharashk, as these clans joined together to master the economic potential of their mark and leverage their mineral wealth.

The Shadow Marches aren't a nation. No one voice speaks for the clans and tribes, and most of the tribes have no interest in dealing with outsiders. House Tharashk is the largest faction in the region, and their city of Zarash'ak is the center for commerce.

House Tharashk is the main point of contact between the Shadow Marches and the outside world. Tharashk aside, the region remains a collection of tribes and cultists following their ancient traditions in the shadows of the swamps.

### Interesting Things About the Shadow Marches

- The untamed Shadow Marches are filled with mysteries. Relics of the daelkyr rest undisturbed in the depths of the swamps, along with foul monsters and druidic shrines.  
- The Marches are the birthplace of the druidic tradition of the Gatekeepers. Long ago, this sect defeated the vile daelkyr; today, its last champions continue to protect Eberron from aberrations and other extraplanar threats.  
- Even in defeat, the daelkyr sowed seeds of madness in the Marches. Followers of the Cults of the Dragon Below remain scattered across the region. Some of these cults work with mind flayers and other aberrations. Others have no evil intent but are driven by dangerous delusions.  

### Marcher Characters

As you develop a Marcher character or NPC, consider the following:

**The Mark of Finding.** An alliance of Marcher clans formed House Tharashk, but not all those who carried the mark chose to join this house. As a half-orc with the Mark of Finding, you could be a child of the Marches with a strong tie to the house, or you could be a scion of a small tribe of hunters, proud of your independence and suspicious of the houses. Your ties to the Marches might be distant because you were born to a family that left years ago. Do you want to rediscover your ancestral roots?

**Madness and Mysticism**. Most Marchers have a mystical view of the world, beliefs shaped by the traditions of the Gatekeepers and the madness of the daelkyr. Marchers typically feel that the people of the treaty nations are [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by their civilized ways. You have heard the truth in the voices of croaking frogs and seen it in the shadows shifting on the water. Whether you're loyal to the Gatekeepers, the Sovereign Host, or the Dragon Below, superstitions inform your path.

**Clan or Tribe**? The people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The clans blend the traditions of human and orc, building towns and working with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of civilization aren't that strange to you; you've seen the city of Zarash'ak and worked with House Tharashk. By contrast, the Marcher tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic hunter-gatherers, they don't work metals; they make their tools from stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this new world?

### Cities and Sites

The clans of the Shadow Marches primarily live in small towns and villages, their huts raised above the swamps on stilts. The Shadow Marches contain many manifest zones tied to Xoriat and Kythri (see "chapter 4" for descriptions of both), the planes of madness and chaos. Time moves strangely in places in the deep swamps, which twists mundane beasts and plants into strange shapes. Daelkyr ruins linger in these areas, remnants of the ancient war against the goblins and orcs that once dominated Khorvaire.

#### Dragonshard Fields

The Shadow Marches hold deposits of Eberron dragonshards, the source of House Tharashk's wealth. These fields aren't as rich as those in Q'barra, but there's gold to be made by those willing to hunt for shards in the dangerous swamps.

#### Vvaraak's Cave

The green dragon Vvaraak is said to have taught the secrets of druidic magic to the first Gatekeepers thousands of years ago. Though Vvaraak is long dead, rumors say that her hidden lair holds secrets tied to the Draconic Prophecy and the mysteries of druidic magic.

#### Zarash'ak

Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak. Built on stilts and known for its cuisine and music, Zarash'ak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the swamps. House Tharashk oversees the City of Stilts, but Marcher clans and tribes come here to sell crafts and other goods or to celebrate religious rituals.

### Aftermath of the Last War

The Shadow Marches aren't a nation, and the region wasn't recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold. Most Marchers have little interest in the outside world. Marcher tribes don't know the names or number of the nations beyond the swamps, let alone that they were at war. However, as House Tharashk gains power and influence in the world beyond the swamps, it has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has expanded Zarash'ak dramatically over the last decade and is working on transforming other towns into cities. This has caused tension with a number of tribes. And House Tharashk's mining operations and its urban expansion always run the risk of disrupting Gatekeeper seals and unleashing ancient evils bound beneath the Marches.

## Talenta Plains

**Capital**: Gatherhold

**Hallmarks**: Dinosaurs, halflings, livestock

The halflings of the Talenta Plains have no cities and no industrialized magic, but they do have dinosaurs. The halflings domesticated the dinosaurs of the plains and use these creatures as mounts, livestock, and beasts of burden. A sacred bond exists between a hunter and mount, and few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a furious clawfoot raptor.

Talenta religion reveres spirits, both departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a lath—a chieftain who guides the tribe—and shamans who consult the spirits and choose the paths of migration.

In the past, the tribes stood alone, but during the Last War, many halflings came together under Lathon Halpum to defend their land. Halpum won recognition for the Plains as one of the Thronehold nations, though it's still unclear what this means beyond increasing passage between the Plains and the outside world.

### Interesting Things About the Talenta Plains

- House Ghallanda and House Jorasco both originated in the Talenta Plains. The dragonmarked bloodlines appear throughout the tribes, though you can play a dragonmarked halfling from the Plains who doesn't work for the houses.  
- The Talentan reverence for spirits derives from the fact that a variety of spirits haunt the Plains. The region contains an unusual number of manifest zones tied to Dolurrh and Thelanis (see "chapter 4" for descriptions of both). Ghosts are more likely to linger in such places, and minor fey are scattered across the Plains.  
- Stories tell of ancient ruins that date back to the first age of the world and of a vast graveyard holding the bones of dragons.  

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/078-2-10.webp#center)

### Talentan Characters

See chapter 1 for quirks and other features relevant to halfling characters from the Talenta Plains. Also consider the following:

**Wild Warriors and Tricksters.** You were born in the wild, and your wits and your weapons helped you survive. Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on speed and skill. Outlander is a logical background, but you could easily be a folk hero, entertainer, or charlatan. You could even be an urchin who was stranded in a great city and adapted to life there.

**Surrounded by Spirits**. Fey, fiends, and the ghosts of ancestors, these are all part of the spirit world, and they're all around you. Do you believe that the spirits guide your actions? Do you show respect to the spirits of a location? Talentan shamans tend to be druids of the Circle of the Moon or the Circle of the Shepherd (from "Xanathar's Guide to Everything"), often assuming the form of dinosaurs. You could also reflect a strong bond to spirits by playing a warlock with an Archfey patron, a cleric with the Nature domain, a paladin sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, or a barbarian on the Path of the Totem Warrior or Path of the Ancestral Guardian (from "Xanathar's Guide to Everything"). Hermit and outlander are natural backgrounds, but you could be an acolyte or a sage who consults spirits instead of books. Warriors and shamans both wear masks to present a particular face to the spirit world.

**Dinosaurs**. Talenta halflings have a close bond to their dinosaur companions. If you don't begin the campaign with a dinosaur mount or companion, you might acquire one over the course of your adventures. You can also consider whether a fallen dinosaur is part of your backstory; perhaps you lost your faithful mount in the Last War, but you believe its spirit is still with you.

### Cities and Sites

The Talenta Plains have been described as an ocean of grasslands. The nomadic halflings have little interest in building towns; most shelter in the Talenta Plains is temporary. Halflings shun the ruins scattered across the Plains, believing them to be haunted by fiends.

#### Gatherhold

All the halfling tribes come to Gatherhold to trade, hold councils, and settle disputes. House Ghallanda maintains the town, but Gatherhold belongs to the people, not the houses. Other dragonmarked houses offer their services here as well. The town is on the shore of Lake Cyre, and once people came by boat through Cyre; now the Mourning has cut off that passage.

#### The Wandering Inn

This caravan maintained by members of House Ghallanda is a traveling fair, providing entertainment and shelter to any fortunate enough to cross its path. When times are dark and travelers are weary, one can always hope that the Wandering Inn is just beyond the horizon.

### Aftermath of the Last War

The halfling tribes joined together to defend themselves from outsiders, and the Talenta Plains were recognized as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold. Now that the war is over, most of the tribes have returned to their hunting grounds and ancient traditions. They united to defend their way of life, and now they wish to enjoy it.

But the halflings don't yet know if it's possible to return to the previous ways. More foreigners visit the Plains than at any time in the past. Settlers and merchants cross the Plains as they make their way to Q'barra, and they clash with Q'barran bandits. The Valenar elves ride through the Plains in search of adventure. Monsters emerge from the Mournland. Dragonmarked houses seek to expand their role at Gatherhold and to explore the untapped resources of the Plains.

The halflings have no interest in change, but it might be inevitable. Lathon Halpum believes that if the tribes can work together, they could become a nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path. Holy Uldra is a powerful shaman and the leader of her own tribe. She urges halfling warriors to join together for a single purpose: to drive all outsiders from the Plains and to maintain the ancient traditions. The halflings must decide whether the tribes will choose the path of peace or return to war.

## Thrane

**Capital**: Flamekeep

**Hallmarks**: Divine magic, fine crafts, fruit, livestock, the Silver Flame, textiles, wool

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—I was scorched by the Silver Flame!
> 
> Growing up on the streets of the Callestan district in Sharn, I learned not to put my faith in anything I couldn't see or hold. I think that's why my editor sent me to Flamekeep to cover the Ascension; surely I'd see clearly, with eyes untouched by faith. I thought so, too. But then I found myself in the Chamber of Tira's Sacrifice, a pillar of silver fire marking the spot where one woman gave her life to protect countless innocents. I saw people from all nations joined together in song, celebrating both that ancient sacrifice and the end of our current war. And looking into the innocent eyes of the child priestess, I truly heard the words of that song for the first time: a call for all of us to be better than we are, to protect those in need, to remember that we are all one people in the light of the Silver Flame.
^the-sharn-inquisitivei-was-scorched-by-the-silver-flame

The modern Church of the Silver Flame was founded in Thrane, and most of the people of the nation follow this faith. During the Last War, the people of Thrane chose to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to embrace the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years, Thrane has been a theocracy. The head of the state is 11-year-old Jaela Daran, the divinely selected Keeper of the Flame. Jaela depends on the Council of Cardinals to perform the practical work of running the nation.

The primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent from supernatural evil. The church has always had a militant aspect, with battalions of templars and peasant militias prepared to face undead, lycanthropes, or other monstrous threats. But compassion and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.

Not all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.

### Interesting Things About Thrane

- Faith is part of daily life in Thrane, and divine adepts provide important services. Magic is also common in Thrane. *Everbright lanterns* light the streets while magewrights and wizards practice their trades, though there are fewer of them than in other nations.  
- Every town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark forces—necromancers, warlocks, and the like—finds Thrane a dangerous, unwelcoming place.  
- The feudal system of nobility remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the church. Queen Diani ir'Wynarn is the "blood regent," serving as a symbolic advisor to the Keeper of the Flame. A small fraction of the population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power.  

### Thrane Characters

As you develop a Thrane character, consider the following details:

**The Impact of Faith.** If you want to reflect a close bond to the Silver Flame, you could gain a few divine spells by taking the Magic Initiate feat. Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you might focus on archery-related combat styles or take the Sharpshooter feat. Any Thrane could take the acolyte background to reflect a strong connection to the church or the soldier background based on service with the templars.

**Church or Crown**? Do you support the theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it and invites corruption.

**Dealing with Darkness**. The Shadow in the Flame can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush all darkness?

![Cathedral of the Silver Flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/079-2-11.webp#center)

### Cities and Sites

The Church of the Silver Flame is a militant faith, and Thrane communities are built around fortified churches designed to serve as fortresses in times of trouble. Larger towns maintain sturdy walls patrolled by skilled archers. A Flamic architectural style appears throughout the region. Buildings incorporate light and soaring spaces, and icons of the Silver Flame and images of the martyr Tira Miron appear throughout the nation.

#### Flamekeep

The spiritual heart and capital of Thrane, Flamekeep is a massive fortress city. The Keeper of the Flame dwells in the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame, which holds the pillar of fire born when Tira Miron sacrificed herself to bind the demon Bel Shalor. The cathedral is the seat of the Council of Cardinals and the primary garrison of the templar order. Flamekeep is also home to Thalingard, the ancestral palace of the rulers of Thrane and current residence of Queen Diani ir'Wynarn.

#### Shadukar

Shadukar is a grim reminder of the cost of the war. Once known as the Jewel of the Sound, this coastal city was destroyed in a bitter siege against Karrnathi forces. The city has yet to be reclaimed, and it's said to be haunted both by Thrane ghosts and by undead forces left behind by the Karrns.

#### Thaliost

An ancient Aundairian city seized during the Last War, Thaliost was ceded to Thrane under the Treaty of Thronehold. Many of its people bitterly oppose the Thrane occupation, but it's also become a haven for Aundairian followers of the extremist Pure Flame sect; violence often breaks out between these two factions.

### Aftermath of the Last War

The war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane and its neighbors. Aundairian war magic created a blasted wasteland between the two nations. To the east, the conflict with Karrnath left farms and cities such as Shadukar devastated and abandoned, home only to the lingering undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.

For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The Silver Flame urges people to stand together in the face of evil, and across the nation, villagers work together to repair the damage inflicted during the war. People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.

The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath for its use of undead soldiers, and many Thranes are quick to imagine all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise, Thranes have bitter memories of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch knights receive a cold reception.

For most Thranes, the war strengthened their faith and drew them together. However, some question the validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found even among the most devout followers of the faith; such people fear that the merging of temporal and spiritual authority distracts the church from its proper mission. If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore Queen Diani to power.

Thaliost is another open wound. The Council of Cardinals is determined to hold onto this prize, but it is a bitter point of contention with Aundair and a constant source of tension and violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you support Thrane's rule?

## Thronehold

**Capital**: Throneport

**Hallmarks**: Entertainers, international intrigue, spies

After forging a united kingdom, Galifar I realized early on that the crown could not rule from one of the existing realms. To do so would be to put one of the Five Nations above the others, and that would lead to breaks and fractures that would eventually destroy the kingdom. Thus, he established his seat of power on an island in Scions Sound. There he built the great castle of Thronehold.

After Jarot's death and the rejection of the line of succession that led to the Last War, the island and castle were largely abandoned. A special detachment of House Deneith guards, the Throne Wardens, remained in place to protect the castle, but all government functions ceased with the collapse of the Kingdom of Galifar.

Throneport, a town in the shadow of the castle, became a place for dissidents, criminals, spies, and mercenaries, and the once safe port turned into a rough-and-tumble town without allegiance to any single nation.

### Interesting Things About Thronehold

- Representatives (and spies) of the Five Nations gather in the town of Throneport, where it's impossible to tell friend from foe and alliances shift daily.  
- Although Cyre no longer has a peacekeeping force on the island, many Cyrans find work here as spies and agents for other nations.  

### Thronehold Characters

As you develop a character or NPC from Thronehold, consider the following:

**Cold Warriors**. Thronehold is a gladiatorial arena for diplomats and spies, a dangerous playground for bored nobles, and a haven for treacherous double agents. Characters with the charlatan, spy, noble, or criminal background might all test their skills here.

**Play It Again**. If diplomats and spies have one thing in common, it's a weakness for pleasant distractions. When not playing their games of deceit, they seek out the best entertainment and companionship the island has to offer. Characters with the entertainer background can make many untrustworthy friends here.

### Aftermath of the Last War

By 975 YK, Throneport had grown into a small city in which all of the nations and dragonmarked houses had at least a small presence, turning it into a hotbed of international intrigue. The Treaty of Thronehold further solidified Throneport as a multinational capital under the control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane, with House Deneith Throne Wardens in place to make sure the terms of the treaty are honored. Today, the small city is neutral ground, but the castle and its grounds remain off limits and under the watchful protection of the wardens.

## Valenar

**Capital**: Taer Valaestas

**Hallmarks**: Elves, horses, mercenaries

In the midst of the Last War, an army of Tairnadal warrior elves from Aerenal seized this region from Cyre, invoking a claim to the land from long before humanity's arrival on the continent. The elves of Valenar devote themselves to the arts of war. Their cavalry has no equal in Khorvaire, and they combine a talent for magic with stealth and swordplay. Cyre employed the Valenar as mercenaries until the elves betrayed Cyre and took a corner of the nation for themselves. These lands escaped the destruction visited upon the rest of Cyre. After the Mourning, no one wanted to challenge the Valenar's claim to the land they had taken; in the interests of peace, the Treaty of Thronehold recognized the new elf kingdom of Valenar.

Valenar elves spend little time at rest, operating in small units called warbands. Those who aren't patrolling the kingdom travel abroad seeking adventure. Half-elves handle the civic administration. Some of these are the children of Valenar elves, but most are immigrants who've come from elsewhere in Khorvaire in search of opportunity. Cyran humans still occupying the region fall below them in rank. Once citizens of Cyre, now they're citizens of Valenar. Little has changed for the commoners, most of whom don't care who wears the crown.

The harsh sands of the Blade Desert cover northern Valenar and serve as a natural barrier between this land and the rest of Khorvaire. Beyond the desert, Valenar transitions from rolling steppes to fertile plains. The desert can be deadly, but the Valenar elves pose the greatest risk for adventurers. The elves won't interfere with peaceful caravans, but a well-armed group of travelers invites challenges.

### Interesting Things About Valenar

- The dragonmarked House Lyrandar helped the Valenar elves build the infrastructure of their kingdom. The half-elves have no homeland, but House Lyrandar hopes to make Valenar a haven for its people.  
- The ancestors of the elves fought goblins for control of this region many thousands of years ago. Relics of that struggle are still scattered across Valenar and the Blade Desert: ruins, haunted fortresses, and battlefields that have slipped out of alignment with time.  
- Valenar warbands include druids and rangers, and druidic magic bolsters the military arsenal of the elves. Walls of thorns surround elven fortresses, and beasts fight alongside the elves. Valenar horses are known for being as fearless and stubborn as the elves who ride them.  

### Valenar Characters

See chapter 1 for additional information about creating Valenar elves. When creating a Valenar character or NPC, consider the following:

**Martial Role**. Valenar was forged in war. As an elf, consider your role in a warband. Are you a simple soldier, an acolyte devoted to the elven ancestors, or a sage familiar with your Valenar history? As a half-elf, you might be an entertainer, a sailor, or a guild artisan working to support the elf army, or you might be a charlatan seeking opportunities. As a human from Valenar, you could be an urchin born in Taer Valaestas, or a folk hero fighting for the common people.

**Dreams**. Have you left Valenar behind, or are your aspirations tied to the new kingdom? As a half-elf with Valenar blood, do you want to be recognized as a true Valenar—granted a bond to a patron ancestor and a chance at immortality—or are you more interested in building a homeland for your people? As a human whose land the elves reclaimed, do you want to work with the elves or do you want to drive them out—and if so, who do you want to replace them?

**Animal Companions**. Feytouched beasts play an important role in Valenar society. The Valenar are known for their steeds, but a wide range of Valenar beasts bond with non-elves. As a starting character, you might not have established a connection to a Valenar beast. If you return to Valenar later in your adventuring career, perhaps you will find your bondmate.

### Cities and Sites

Most of the communities of Valenar consist of farming villages, with fortress towers scattered across the plains as military outposts.

#### Moonshadow

A peaceful Khoravar village built on the Old Road, Moonshadow is a young community, built by immigrants who hope that Valenar can become a home for their people. Though small, Moonshadow has drawn half-elves from across Khorvaire, and a surprising number of gifted scholars and artisans thrive in the village.

#### Pylas Maradal

The second largest city in Valenar, Pylas Maradal is a port on the southern coast. House Lyrandar has invested in the city and built shipyards and a large house enclave. The port sees traffic from Q'barra, Sarlona, and Aerenal. When the region was part of Cyre, this city was known as Southport, a haven for smugglers and pirates.

#### Taer Valaestas

High King Shaeras Vadallia maintains his seat in Taer Valaestas. Located in the center of the kingdom, the city is built for war and surrounded by a living wall of bronzewood thorns. In addition to the royal palace, outposts of most dragonmarked houses, and a market where foreigners sell their wares, Taer Valaestas hosts the primary temple of the Keepers of the Past and a vast arena used for horse training, races, and other displays of equestrian skill.

### Aftermath of the Last War

There's a popular saying in Taer Valaestas: "The shadow of war hangs long over Valenar." War defines Valenar culture. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized Valenar as a sovereign nation, but the elves are already pushing the limits of the treaty. Some venture into the Mournland or the untamed jungles of Q'barra, and Valenar warbands have launched raids into Darguun and Karrnath. High King Shaeras Vadallia has promised to rein in his warriors, but many believe that the elves will continue their provocation. Their main interest is conflict with a worthy foe—and they might want Darguun or Karrnath to declare war.

Because of this, the nation remains on a war footing. Villages find it challenging to produce the supplies required to maintain the elf army. Still, the Valenar are rarely cruel overlords. As long as a village can meet its quotas, the elves leave it alone, though villages that fall below expectations are more likely to receive assistance from druidic advisors than punishment.

## Zilargo

**Capital**: Trolanport

**Hallmarks**: Alchemy, education, elemental binding, entertainment, gnomes, precious stones

At first glance, the homeland of the gnomes appears to be a paradise. City streets are bright and clean, the universities and libraries are the finest in Khorvaire, everyone seems happy and helpful, and crime is all but unheard of. But Zil society teems with layers of intrigue and blackmail invisible to human eyes. The Trust, a ruthless secret police force, eliminates any threat to society.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/081-2-13.webp#center)

Zilargo isn't a tyranny. Each major city has a democratically elected ruling council and a seat on the Triumvirate that governs the nation; the Trust reports to the Triumvirate. The Zil gnomes built this system, and they are quite happy with it. Their streets are safe, and as long as you play by the rules of the game, the Trust ignores you. Outsiders find this casual acceptance of preemptive assassination to be terrifying, but the Zil genuinely trust the Trust.

Zil gnomes live within a web of intrigues. The Trust condones their actions, as long as they break no laws and don't threaten the state or the status quo. A gnome charlatan can connive to steal a jewel mine from another gnome—as long as the charlatan accomplishes the deed through cunning, negotiation, or deception rather than violence or outright theft, and as long as the mine stays in Zil hands. The same applies to adventurers planning schemes in Zilargo. Violence draws attention and deadly consequences from the Trust, but intrigue is perfectly acceptable.

The Trust is a network of spies and assassins. Most agents of the Trust simply pass information through dead drops; some estimate that a third of the nation works for the Trust in this capacity. When the Trust identifies a threat, it acts preemptively. Trust agents prefer to solve a problem without violence—by sharing a piece of information or a whispered warning sent via a [message](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/message.md) spell. But the Trust won't hesitate to eliminate a threat, whether with poison, spell, or blade. Typically, a target never sees the agent of their demise.

### Interesting Things About Zilargo

- Most consider the Library of Korranberg the finest repository of knowledge in Khorvaire.  
- The *Korranberg Chronicle* is the leading source of news in Khorvaire. Gnome chroniclers travel across Khorvaire in search of stories.  
- The major cities of Zilargo maintain temples and shrines dedicated to every religion. Most Zil explore a few faiths before settling on one; others practice multiple religions.  

### Zil Characters

As you develop a Zil character, consider the following factors:

**Family Ties**. In a nation shaped by intrigue, you need someone you can rely on. For the Zil, that's family. Unless you're an orphan, discuss your family with your DM. What's their business? Who's your favorite relative? Are you currently involved in any family schemes? Family members might call on you for help over the course of your adventurers, but they can also be a resource for you.

**Knowledge and Power**. The Zil prize knowledge above all else. Sage is a suitable background for any Zil; charlatan and spy are also appropriate, reflecting their love of intrigue. Classes that specialize in melee combat are rare among the Zil. The soldiers of Zilargo include rogues, bards, wizards, and artificers.

**The Trust**. In creating a Zil character, consider whether you have any ties to the Trust. A vast number of gnomes serve as the eyes and ears of the Trust, reporting interesting information to a Trust handler. As an active agent, you could receive missions tied to your current adventures. If you and your companions are fighting the Emerald Claw, you might have a secondary assignment to eliminate a specific Claw agent or acquire a particular object from their base. While the spy background is a logical choice for a Trust agent, the agency recruits characters of every class and background. Your class abilities reflect specialized training and granted abilities—the magical equivalent of spy gadgets!

### Cities and Sites

The gnomes of Zilargo place a high value on appearances. They design beauty into their architecture, featuring delicate carvings, elaborate railings and balconies, and lavish gardens. Every community contains murals and statues scattered throughout. Most fixtures and buildings are designed for those of small stature, but buildings constructed for taller folk also exist. The Zil have a talent for illusion and for binding elementals, and they incorporate both of these forms of magic into everyday life.

#### Korranberg

Nestled against the base of the Seawall Mountains, Korranberg is the oldest city in Zilargo. Many aristocrats of other nations come to study in the famous library and the gnome colleges of Korranberg. The ancestral citadel of House Sivis is located here, as well as a host of temples including the Codex Vault, Khorvaire's largest shrine to Aureon.

#### Thurimbar

This port city draws musicians and artists from across Khorvaire. It addition to its legendary clubs and schools of music, Thurimbar is on the cutting edge of arcane sound—the use of illusion magic to generate music. Entertainers flock to Thurimbar to share their music and immerse themselves in its rich musical culture.

#### Trolanport

With its crisscrossing canals and flooded streets, the capital of Zilargo serves as the center of the gnome shipbuilding industry and a nexus for trade. Scores of ships make port here daily. Among the many beautiful things the city is known for are its spectacular coastal thunderstorms. Crowds gather on balconies and verandas to watch these awesome displays.

The Tower of the Triumvirate rises over the central portion of the city. House Kundarak, House Sivis, and House Cannith maintain outposts in the city, and the other dragonmarked houses station agents here as well.

#### Zolanberg

Hidden high in the Seawall Mountains, Zolanberg lies at the heart of a network of jewel mines. These mines face attacks by kobolds living in the mountains, as well as goblin raiders from Darguun. Gnomes and dwarves inhabit the city. House Kundarak maintains a great vault here while House Tharashk has completed construction of a large hall for the Prospectors Guild.

### Aftermath of the Last War

Walking the streets of Korranberg, one might never know that the war occurred. Zilargo avoided most of the violence of the Last War, and cosmetic magic and illusions were employed to repair the few cities that suffered damage. Many Zil prefer to ignore the war completely, referring to it as "that unpleasantness to the north." Nonetheless, Zilargo was a staunch ally of Breland during the war, providing the nation with ships, intelligence, and elemental weaponry. This aid left the nation with enemies. The Order of the Emerald Claw has launched attacks on Zil communities, and certain cells of Breland's Swords of Liberty accuse the Zil of manipulating Breland. The Trust has contained these attacks, but it always anticipates more trouble ahead.

The jewel miners of eastern Zilargo often clash with the goblins of Darguun and the kobolds that live in Seawall Mountains. These skirmishes could expand into wider conflicts.

Overall, however, little has changed in Zilargo because the Trust keeps the nation on a steady path. Adventurers who travel through Zilargo would be wise to avoid causing trouble or drawing the Trust's attention.

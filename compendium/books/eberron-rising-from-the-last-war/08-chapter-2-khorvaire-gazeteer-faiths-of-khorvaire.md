# Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazeteer - Faiths of Khorvaire
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War, p. 140* 

Religion plays an important role in Eberron. The gods don't manifest physically, but people of faith believe that divine forces shape everyday life. Shared beliefs unite communities and can provide hope in difficult times.

Most Khorvairians acknowledge the pantheon of the Sovereign Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six. The Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of Khorvaire—except for Thrane, which favors the Church of the Silver Flame. Other religions connect specific cultures or communities; the kalashtar observe the Path of Light, and the Undying Court guides the elves of Aerenal.

Religion is especially important for a paladin, cleric, or druid, yet any character can have faith in a higher power. Following a religion is a way to give your character a deeper connection to the world and a bond to other members of the community. The Foundation of Faith table can provide ideas for the source of your beliefs.

Conversely, a lack of faith can also be a meaningful part of your story. If you don't believe in any divine power, what caused such doubt? The Rejection of Faith table offers ideas that can help shape your story.

## Sovereign Host

- The Sovereigns are with us at all times. Onatar stands at every forge, and Dol Dorn is with you whenever blades are drawn.  
- The Sovereigns shape the world. They offer us guidance and strength, but we must learn to listen.  
- Honor every Sovereign in their place and time. If you hear one voice clearly, embrace their path.  
- As a follower of the Sovereign Host, you believe that the hand of the Sovereigns can be seen in all things. What others take to be intuition or instinct, you see as the voice of the Sovereigns offering guidance. You don't need absolute proof; the fact of a bountiful harvest is evidence of Arawai's benevolence.  

The pantheon of the Sovereign Host embodies all that is good in the world. The people of Khorvaire have followed the Sovereigns for thousands of years, and everyone knows the names of the Sovereigns and the Dark Six. Even people who aren't devout might still swear by the Sovereigns or offer a prayer in a moment of crisis.

The Sovereign Host is wondrously diverse. Variations and subsects of the faith thrive, and temples are only loosely aligned. In a small community, a skilled smith might double as the priest because people believe he's close to Onatar. A midwife might symbolically speak for Arawai and Boldrei. Typically, the faithful are united by their shared beliefs; no central authority seeks to enforce a singular creed.

As a Vassal—a follower of the Sovereign Host—you might feel connection to a particular Sovereign, but still show reverence to each. Your background can influence your particular interpretation of the Sovereigns—the Talenta halflings consider the Sovereigns part of a pantheon of spirits, while some Karrns honor only the Sovereigns of war—but any character can be a Vassal.

### Sovereigns

These common names and attributes describe the nine Sovereigns as they are worshiped in Khorvaire:

**Arawai** is the Sovereign of Life and Love. She is the patron of fertility and of the benevolent aspects of nature, bringing good harvest and gentle rain.

**Aureon** is the Sovereign of Law and Lore. He is considered the first wizard, who shared the secrets of wizardry with the world.

**Balinor** is the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt. He guides both the beast and the hunter, and he is the patron of those who walk on the edge of civilization and the natural world.

**Boldrei** is the Sovereign of Hall and Hearth. She guides and protects communities and families, inspiring people to work together for the common good.

**Dol Arrah** is the sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices for the greater good.

**Dol Dorn** is the Sovereign of Strength and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and martial skill.

**Kol Korran** is the Sovereign of World and Wealth. He guards travelers and guides traders. Although the Trickery domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer the Keeper of the Dark Six.

**Olladra** is the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune. She is the giver of joy and the granter of luck, patron to entertainers, gamblers, and anyone who takes a chance.

**Onatar** is the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He guides both mundane smiths and artificers, inspiring anyone who performs an act of creation.

### Symbol

The Octagram is the symbol of the Host as a whole. A Sovereign priest either carries a metal Octagram holy symbol or holds a staff tipped with the icon. Priests dedicated to a particular god also display their deity's symbol, and Vassals carry tokens with the symbols of the Sovereigns whose favor they seek. There are eight points in the symbol for eight Sovereigns; the ninth Sovereign (Aureon) is represented by the Octagram itself.

### Rites

Formal prayers to the Sovereigns usually involve song. Specific songs invoke each Sovereign and seek their favor, appreciate the blessings received, and recognize the presence of a Sovereign. Celebrants sing the songs of Boldrei and Aureon at weddings, and soldiers sing Dol Dorn's marching songs on the move and Dol Arrah's hymns on the dawn before a battle.

### Temples

Sovereign shrines arise where people feel the deities are close, such as a library for Aureon or a smithy for Onatar. The rites of Boldrei or Arawai typically occur in the wild, and a tavern could serve as a shrine to Olladra. The shrines can take any form, but they prominently display the symbol of the particular Sovereign.

Temple of the Sovereign Host are made of stone and have eight doors. The walls depict images of the Sovereigns, with the icon of Aureon over the altar and the Octagram engraved on the floor.

## Dark Six

The Dark Six are the shadows of the Sovereign Host. These dark gods shape the world and are present at all times, speaking to those willing to hear them. Where the Sovereigns govern positive forces, the Dark Six are the source of fears. Arawai and Balinor reflect the positive aspects of nature. The devastating storm, the earthquake, the wildfire? These are the work of the Devourer.

> [!readaloud] The Voice of Thrane—Are you a six fanatic?
> 
> The Vassals of the Sovereign Host have long condemned the Dark Six as forces of evil. Yet correspondents at the *Voice of Thrane* have uncovered a shocking phenomenon: long-standing cults that worship members of the Dark Six alongside the Sovereign Host.
> 
> Most of you know of the Restful Watch, the priests who tend Vassal cemeteries. What you may not know is that the priests of the Watch honor both Aureon and the Keeper! They say that the Keeper snatches the souls of heroes so they can be preserved from Dolurrh and returned when they are needed once more.
> 
> Worse still is the Three Faces of War, a cult that worships the Sovereigns of War—including the Mockery, whom they call Dol Azur. Followers of this foul faith say that the battlefield holds a place for all of these gods, explicitly embracing a deity they acknowledge as the patron of treachery and terror! This cult apparently began in the Karrnathi military but spread across the Five Nations during the Last War. So next time you're talking to a Brelish soldier, remember that they might be a devotee of the Mockery!
^the-voice-of-thraneare-you-a-six-fanatic

The Dark Six and the Sovereign Host are opposite sides of the same coin. If you believe in one, you acknowledge the existence of the other. The only question is whether you fear the Six or revere them. Those who choose to follow these sinister deities embrace darkness. A barbarian may thank the Fury for the gift of rage. An assassin walks the path of the Mockery, while a warlock's pact may be a gift of the Shadow.

The Dark Six inspire worship in different ways among diverse cultures. Temples to the Dark Six appear in Droaam, along with wild revels driven by the Fury. The Dark Six aren't worshiped openly elsewhere in Khorvaire; the gods' shrines are hidden, and it's more common to find a cult devoted to a single member of the Six than a temple dedicated to the entire pantheon.

### The Six

These common names and attributes describe the Dark Six as they are known in Khorvaire:

**The Devourer** governs the destructive power of nature, both pure elemental force and savagery in beasts.

**The Keeper** snatches souls before they can reach Dolurrh and hoards them along with his vast wealth. Those driven by greed call him their patron, and his priests often act as criminal fixers.

**The Fury** governs both passion and revenge, rage and despair. She offers revenge to those who have been wronged, but her vengeance often leads to suffering.

**The Mockery** is the patron of treachery and of terror in battle. He guides those who seek victory through guile, both warriors and assassins. He was once the brother of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, but he was stripped of his skin and his name after betraying them.

**The Shadow** is the dark side of knowledge and ambition. It's said to be Aureon's shadow, given malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent spells to warlocks and wizards.

**The Traveler** asserts that chaos drives evolution and that change makes us stronger. The Traveler is a trickster and the giver of dangerous gifts. Some artificers worship the Traveler, seeing it as the lord of innovation, but the gifts of the Traveler always have unexpected consequences.

### Symbol

The Hexagram represents the entire pantheon of the Dark Six. The Deities of Eberron table lists the common symbols of the individual gods. However, since the Six aren't worshiped openly in most of Khorvaire, each sect chooses a unique symbol based on the nature of their god. Followers of the Devourer might carry a shark's tooth or a piece of wood scorched in a wildfire. A Keeper cult might use the nine-sided coin of Kol Korran with the face disfigured. A particular sect uses these symbols consistently, if not obviously.

### Rites

The Dark Six are a mirror of the Sovereign Host and their worship uses similar rituals, including formal rituals conducted in song.

Each of the Six has their own rites. Followers of the Fury engage in wild revels. Cults of the Devourer gather around enormous bonfires. Cults of the Mockery conduct ritual combats or gather to torture captured enemies.

### Temples

Temples and shrines of the Dark Six hide behind disguises. A cult of the Mockery might gather in a slaughterhouse, while a shrine to the Shadow remains concealed in the deep stacks of a library. Dedicated temples are built from dark stone, with six doors and the Hexagram engraved in the floor.

## Church of the Silver Flame

- The Silver Flame is force of light that holds fiends at bay. Those who seek to defend the innocent from evil can draw on the power of the Flame.  
- Every mortal soul can find the light. Inspire and guide others to virtuous behavior; force is a last resort.  
- Listen to the Voice of the Flame; beware the deceiving whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.  

Every Thrane child knows the story of Tira Miron. Centuries ago, one of the ancient and powerful demons chained within the world broke free from its bonds, unleashing terrible suffering on the people of Thrane. The nation would have been destroyed if not for Tira Miron. This paladin was called by the Silver Flame and battled the mighty fiend. When it became clear that the overlord couldn't be destroyed, Tira gave her life, combining her spirit with the light of the Silver Flame to bind the demon once more. Now Tira serves as the Voice of the Flame, helping others find the light. Anyone who seeks to protect the innocent and battle evil can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to aid them, but they must beware of the Shadow in the Flame, the demon that still lingers and yearns to trick good people into evil.

> [!readaloud] The Korranberg Chronicle—No faith in Silver Flame top tyke
> 
> The nation of Thrane shocked the world in 993 YK when it appointed a six-year-old child as Keeper of the Silver Flame, the supreme leadership position of the Church. Now eleven years old, Jaela Daran continues to astound all who encounter her. She possesses poise and wisdom beyond her years, and she displays the blend of courage and compassion that is the cornerstone of the faith. As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.
> 
> But some claim that these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?
^the-korranberg-chronicleno-faith-in-silver-flame-top-tyke

A pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira's sacrifice, the center of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.

The church's templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira Miron.

The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders still respected the Keeper's authority over spiritual matters, but the war wasn't about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become the ruling body. While still driven by Tira's principles of redemption and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.

In creating a follower of the Silver Flame, decide whether you are bound to the church or simply inspired by its principles. As a paladin, are you part of the templar order, or were you a farmer called to action by the Voice of the Silver Flame?

The Silver Flame is centered in Thrane, but it has a strong presence in Breland and Aundair, and followers across Khorvaire. Members of the Pure Flame sect treat some species—notably shifters and changelings—with suspicion, but the faith holds that people of all races should stand together.

### Symbol

The faith's symbol is a stylized flame inlaid with silver. A silver arrowhead etched with the symbol serves as a common token, worn as a necklace.

### Rites

The Silver Flame has no need of prayers or offerings; instead, services focus on the parishioners, encouraging virtuous behavior. Church hierarchy is strictly observed, and only ordained priests can perform services.

Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, used both as a means of meditation and a martial art. Communities devoted to the Flame engage in archery training, and villages have militias of peasant archers.

### Temples

Fortresses of the Silver Flame are designed to serve as templar garrisons and to provide sanctuary against supernatural threats. Churches feature enormous arches and open spaces. The sanctuary of a Flamic church has a mosaic floor with a flame burning at its center.

The seat of the religion is the Grand Cathedral in Flamekeep. Built around the site of Tira's sacrifice, this fortified temple is the size of a small city.

## Blood of Vol

- Everyone has a spark of divinity. Find that power within.  
- Death is the end, Dolurrh is oblivion, and if the gods exist, they are cruel. Stand with those you care for; all we have is this life and each other.  

> [!readaloud] Voice of Breland—Corpse Cleric Condemns Claw
> 
> Last month, the Emerald Claw took credit for the ghoul outbreak in Wroat. This terrorist organization has a new and unusual critic: Hask Malevanor, an "abactor" of the Blood of Vol and high priest of the Crimson Monastery, a temple in the city of Atur in Karrnath. Something else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he's been dead for over fifty years! This putrid priest says that there's nothing unholy about his condition, swearing that his people revere all life. Despite the fact that the terrorists included priests from his church, Malevanor insists that his parishioners despise the Emerald Claw and harbor no hostility toward Breland.
> 
> While we'd like to take the abactor at his word, our research shows that Malevanor was personally involved in the program that produced the infamous Karrnathi undead soldiers. After decades of driving the Karrnathi war effort, this foul creature expects us to believe that he has nothing to do with the necromantic attacks on our people? Here at the *Voice of Breland*, we think something about this smells rotten, and it's not just the mummy.
^voice-of-brelandcorpse-cleric-condemns-claw

What just god would allow death and suffering? The Blood of Vol teaches that we all have the potential to become divine beings—and that death is a curse, designed to kill you before you can unlock the divinity within you.

The Blood of Vol is a grim faith, founded by Erandis d'Vol, an elf from Aerenal. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the Sovereigns exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living. Seekers of the Divinity Within (as the faithful call themselves) are glad to be reanimated after death; at least they can do some good.

Because of this association with necromancy, many believe the Blood of Vol embraces death and its followers want to become undead. Both ideas are false. The Blood of Vol sees death as the ultimate evil. Seekers don't want to become undead; they want to become divine beings. The faith teaches that divinity is tied to blood and soul, and the undead can never fully harness that power. The mummies and vampires of the Blood of Vol have sacrificed their chance at divinity to guide the living. They're martyrs, not something to envy.

In addition to a general revulsion toward the undead, the public opinion of the Blood of Vol is colored by the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This extremist sect serves a lich known as the Queen of Death, and it employs necromantic magic in acts of terror. However, most Seekers don't support the Emerald Claw.

The Blood of Vol has its strongest following in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities. For a time, it was the national religion of Karrnath. Though fallen from favor, the faith is still practiced openly in that nation.

### Symbol

The power of a cleric of the Blood of Vol comes from within them. As such, every cleric chooses a unique holy symbol—an object that resonates with them. More generally, the faith is represented by a tear-shaped red gemstone or shard of glass. Priests of the Blood of Vol wear robes of red and black.

### Rites

The services of the Blood of Vol focus on drawing the faithful together as a community and encouraging people to find power within themselves. The most important ritual of the faith is the Sacrament of Blood. After a sermon, each member of the congregation sheds a small amount of blood into a basin. This is a symbol of unity, and a message that members of the community would shed their blood to defend one another. In some temples, this blood is donated to vampire champions of the faith.

### Temples

A shrine devoted to the Blood of Vol requires only an altar and a means for collecting ritually spilled blood.

Temples of the Blood of Vol are fortified structures, built to serve as sanctuaries. In contrast to the Silver Flame, such temples are stark and functional. Temples include vaults or catacombs, designed to hold undead or to store corpses.

## Cults of the Dragon Below

- A paradise exists within the world, a vale bathed in the light of the Inner Sun. Earn your passage with the blood of worthy foes.  
- Our existence is a chrysalis state, preparing us for transcendent immortality within the bowels of the gibbering mouther.  
- The Lord of Eyes sees all secrets. Its gaze elevates the worthy and slays the unbeliever. Drive doubt from your heart, and you will see reality through new eyes.  

> [!readaloud] The Korranberg Chronicle—Raid Reveals Cult Chaos
> 
> The people of Fairhaven were shocked by the revelation of bizarre cult activity in the center of one of that city's most trusted institutions. Acting on a tip from the Royal Eyes of Aundair, elite forces raided a House Vadalis facility and discovered a nightmare. Captain Allis says that her soldiers discovered a beating heart that filled an entire room, pumping blood through veins in the walls of the building. According to Allis, the staff claimed to be "creating the heart of Galifar," apparently believing that if completed, this monstrosity could reunite the shattered kingdom.
> 
> When pressed to comment, Patriarch Dalin d'Vadalis denied any connections to this cult. "These are difficult times for all of us. I assure you that House Vadalis will conduct a full investigation of this incident and work to regain the trust of the good people of Fairhaven."
^the-korranberg-chronicleraid-reveals-cult-chaos

The Cults of the Dragon Below are wildly diverse. The tenets above describe the beliefs of three different cults. Warlocks draw power from demon overlords, and daelkyr cultists serve mind flayers and beholders. Others embrace deep convictions that others see as madness. Outsiders use the term "Cult of the Dragon Below" as a blanket term to describe these disparate beliefs, but the cultists don't use this name or see themselves as part of a greater whole.

Cults of the Dragon Below are based on madness or power. A cult that seeks power chooses to serve a dark force because of the gifts they receive from it. A cabal of scholars might serve the demon overlord [Sul Khatesh](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sul-khatesh-erlw.md) in exchange for secrets of magic. In the Mror Holds, dwarf clans bargain with [Dyrrn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/dyrrn-erlw.md) the Corruptor to gain symbionts and sinister gifts. The Shadow Marches contain cults devoted to the daelkyr [Belashyrra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/belashyrra-erlw.md) and Kyrzin. Membership in such a cult is voluntary, and spellcasters are more likely to be warlocks or wizards than clerics; their power comes from bargaining, not from faith.

Cults driven by madness have a warped view of reality. A cultist might believe aberrations are a higher form of life and that the daelkyr will elevate mortals. Other cultists may not recognize the true nature of the beings they serve. A cult of [Rak Tulkhesh](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rak-tulkhesh-erlw.md) might truly believe their lord will bring peace to the world, even if that peace must begin with bloody war. Joining such a cult isn't a choice, it's something you fall into due to madness. New cults can spring up anywhere, as seeds of madness take root and spread.

Cults of the Dragon Below often appear as antagonists. However, your character could be a member of a relatively benign cult. You might have been raised in a cult but broke free from its influence. If your character was or is part of a cult, work with your DM to develop the details of your sect.

### Symbol

Many cultists carry pieces of volcanic glass or small Khyber dragonshards (see "chapter 5"), but the cults have no unified symbol. Individual cults develop a symbol based on their fiendish patron or mad visions. Eyes, tentacles, and broken weapons are all common themes.

### Rites

Cult rituals are intense and often violent, including blood sacrifice and ritual combat. Many cultists consume unnatural substances, seeking a closer communion to aberrations. They perform rituals in Undercommon, though most cultists don't have a full understanding of the language.

### Temples

Cults meet underground, whether in caverns or sewers. Rural cults seek out places twisted by the powers of the plane of Xoriat (described in "chapter 4") or Khyber.

## Path of Light

- We live in an age of darkness. We must find the path that leads to the light.  
- Act with compassion and courage. Each noble act is a step on the path.  
- Hone your body and your mind. You are the tool you will use to change reality.  

Practiced by many kalashtar, the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringers—the followers of this path—hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.

The Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated by il-Lashtavar, "the great darkness that dreams." This force poisons the world and promotes darkness. But all things change. If enough light can enter the world, it will lead to a tidal shift: the age of il-Lashtavar will end and usher in the time of il-Yannah, the great light.

Some followers of this faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring about the change. Most believe that it is necessary to take action, but that darkness must fought with light. Violence is never the answer, and the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven by ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These shadow watchers believe that evil must be fought, that sources of darkness that poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.

The Path of Light is taught to the kalashtar by the spirits bound to their bloodlines. It is widespread in the nation of Adar in distant Sarlona, but in Khorvaire, it is largely unknown outside kalashtar communities. The shadow watchers champion a sect born in Khorvaire, and the elders of Adar have condemned its methods.

If you follow the Path of Light, you must choose your side. As a lightbringer, you seek to spread hope and goodwill. As a shadow watcher, you hunt down and eliminate sources of darkness. Which path will you follow?

### Symbol

The symbol of the Path of Light is a shard of brilliant crystal, carried or worn as an amulet. This crystal may be used as a holy symbol; if it's worn as a necklace, the priest must place one hand on it to use it as a focus. The formal garb of a priest includes a headdress with curving horns and points made from a Sarlonan shell-like material called sentira.

### Rites

Physical and mental discipline are important virtues of the Path of Light. Martial arts and guided meditation become a form of devotion and prayer. A kalashtar priest conducts services telepathically, using shrines designed to amplify psychic abilities and allowing them to share thoughts and images directly with the congregation. To an outsider, a service can appear silent and tranquil despite being an ecstatic experience for the faithful.

### Temples

The nation of Adar in Sarlona is home to vast fortress monasteries devoted to the Path of Light. In Khorvaire, a mere handful of shrines appear in cities with large kalashtar communities. These shrines are calm and peaceful, the air scented with Sarlonan incense. The chambers are open, providing space for martial arts. Labyrinthine patterns engraved on the floors serve as an aid to meditation, while the walls hold crystals that focus and amplify the psychic abilities of the priests.

## Spirits of the Past

- We are the spiritual anchors of the greatest champions of our people. Through our faith, we keep their spirits from being lost to oblivion.  
- You have been chosen by a hero. Live your life as they lived theirs, letting their instincts guide you.  
- Treasure our past and the stories of our people. You are the vessel through which new legends will arise.  

> [!readaloud] Voice of Breland—The KaLashtar prophecy you can't ignore!
> 
> Many of the people of Khorvaire have never met a kalashtar. Some say these people are in contact with celestial spirits; here at the *Voice of Breland*, we say they're a rare type of lunatic we've imported from Sarlona. So it was a special treat for tourists when one of the spiritual leaders of the kalashtar of Sharn made an unexpected appearance in the grand plaza of Hope's Peak. The enlightened Havakhad—that's what he calls himself—issued a warning that "darkness was gathering" and that "a terrible time lies just ahead." He beseeched the assembled crowds to show kindness to neighbor and stranger alike, and not to let "fear cause strife in the hard days to come." Apparently Havakhad hasn't heard the news that we're winning the war. But if the world does end tomorrow, you read it here first!
^voice-of-brelandthe-kalashtar-prophecy-you-cant-ignore

As a Tairnadal elf of Valenar, you were raised on the legends of your people, on tales of champions who battled mighty dragons and armies of giants. When you came of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to determine which of these ancestors chose you to be their vessel. Since that day, it has been your duty to emulate your patron ancestor. If you're a wizard, you've studied the spells created by your ancestor. If you're a warrior, you've practiced their specific martial techniques. When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies are just preparation. Now it's your sacred duty to be a revenant of your ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described in the "Monster Manual".)

The bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn't speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe that they are with you—that your instincts and your reflexes are the ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new legends.

The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and conquerors. But you don't care about gold or personal glory. All you want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.

You and your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?

Since the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and half-elves can't enter this state. The Keepers say it can't be done, but perhaps you'll be the one to prove them wrong.

### Symbol

The primary symbol of the faith is the zaelshin, an amulet that bears the seal of your patron ancestor and worn either as a brooch or embedded in the forehead of a helmet. A devotee of the faith typically wears a veil—the zaelta, or "spirit mask"—over their lower face while in battle or performing rituals, so an opponent sees the zaelshin rather than the living elf.

The zaelshin is the symbol of the faith, but the holy symbol used by a cleric is an object associated with their personal ancestor.

### Rites

Services revolve around the stories of the ancestors, commemorating their glorious deeds, as well as ritual exercises and trance meditation. While resting, an elf spends four hours in trance. The faithful spend this time in communion with their ancestor, experiencing their memories and contemplating their deeds.

### Temples

The nomadic Tairnadal elves don't raise permanent temples. A Keeper of the Past marks a circle on the ground with their blade, and the space within becomes sanctified for the service.

## Undying Court

- Our greatest champions and sages will never be lost to us. Their wisdom guides us, and their power protects us all.  
- Honor our past. Respect our traditions. Perfect your skills and you may earn your place among the Deathless.  
- Destroy those foul creatures that channel the power of Mabar, for they consume the essence of our world.  

The elves of Aerenal refuse to let their greatest souls be lost to the oblivion that is Dolurrh. The wisest and most accomplished elves are preserved after death, becoming members of the Undying Court. The devotion of the living elves sustains the Undying Court, and the Court generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an Aereni cleric, your spells aren't personally granted to you by a specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.

Of all the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can aspire to join the Court.

As a cleric or paladin of the Undying Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating your character, consider why you've traveled so far from home. Are you on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you acting as an agent of a specific councilor—perhaps your own ancestor? The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so if you don't have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead and evil necromancers.

### Symbol

The symbol of the Undying Court is a golden mask with luminous eyes, worn over the face while a priest is carrying out their duties. Devotees wear a smaller mask as a brooch or amulet.

### Rites

The most sacred rite of the Undying Court is trance communion. While in trance, an Aereni elf engages in meditation that connects them to the gestalt consciousness of the Court. This experience affirms the place of the individual as part of the greater whole.

Since trance communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide spiritual and practical guidance to their congregation. A masked priest serves as the face of the Court, and any elf can approach them seeking an ease to their burdens.

### Temples

In Aerenal, the temples of the Undying Court are step pyramids built from stone. In Khorvaire, shrines to the Court use imported Aereni densewood, a particularly tough lumber that grows only on the island. Regardless of form, the walls are engraved with stories about the Undying Councilors that serve as the particular patrons of the temple, usually those related to the local priests.

## Druids of Khorvaire

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—It happened in the FOrest: Tree Hugger Tell-All!
> 
> The alliance of rebel farmers in western Aundair has declared an alliance with the Great Druid Oalian of the Towering Wood, asserting that the farmlands that border these woods are now part of the Eldeen Reaches. The Great Druid is a figure of legend, a powerful mystic who serves as the spiritual leader of a diverse range of druids spread across the region. Another interesting fact about Oalian? He's a tree! Some say he's a child of Eberron herself, while others assert that he's the spirit of an ancient druid trapped in tree form. Whatever the truth, the Great Druid Oalian appears as a massive greatpine in a grove called Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.

- We, the Ashbound, are the champions of the natural world. We defend it from anything and anyone who threatens it.  
- We, the Children of Winter, preserve the natural cycle of life and death. Disease and decay cull the weak and strengthen the whole. We must destroy undead and ensure that the cycle continues.  
- We, the Gatekeepers, protect the natural world from the forces that come from outside it, from those beings that slither in from the darkness beyond.  
- We, the Greensingers, celebrate the magic in the natural world, as well as the fey that embody that magic. We serve as ambassadors between the fey and mortals, protecting each from the other.  
- We, the Wardens of the Wood, protect all the children of Eberron, from the beasts of the wild to the people of the cities. We preserve the balance between nature and civilization and help each understand the other.  

All druids look after the natural world, but they act in different ways. Five well-established paths define most of Khorvaire's druids. In creating a druid character, consider whether you have ties to one of these traditions, and what led you to leave your order. Are you on a mission? Are you exploring the world? Have you been banished, with good reason or otherwise?

### Ashbound

The Ashbound defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.

### Children of Winter

The Children of Winter believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.

### Gatekeepers

The Gatekeepers are one of the oldest sects, primarily found among the orcs of the Shadow Marches. They act to protect Eberron from aberrations and other unnatural creatures and seek to prevent extraplanar incursions and attacks. The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.

### Greensingers

The Greensingers are devoted to the fey, and serve as mediators between the fey and mortals. The ranks of the Greensingers include bards as well as warlocks with Archfey patrons; a druid or ranger might also serve a specific archfey.

### Wardens of the Wood

The Wardens of the Wood believe that civilization has a place in the world. As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they don't cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized.

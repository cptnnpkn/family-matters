# Chapter 3: Sharn, City of Towers
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War*

Skycoaches work their way through the maze of bridges connecting the towers, and up above I can see the burning ring of an elemental airship.

Over there, a tattooed elf haggles with a masked halfling, arguing about the price of lizard meat. Beyond them, a gargoyle watches from a high perch. I gather my senses and keep moving.

All the major themes of Eberron are manifest in the great city of Sharn. It's a place of magic, with skycoaches circling mile-high towers and mystic forges toiling endlessly in the bowels. It's a place of adventure and intrigue. A fallen angel is gathering minions in the ruins below the city. A gang war is gaining strength in Callestan. The corpse of a murdered aristocrat has just been discovered in a floating mansion. A Cannith artificer is experimenting with a planar gateway—and something is about to go terribly wrong. All of these adventures and a hundred more are waiting in the City of Towers.

This chapter details the city for players and DMs alike. The DM can find additional information about the city in "chapter 4".

## The Shape of Sharn

Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire, with a population of half a million people. Humans make up about a third of that number, and dwarves are a sixth of it; the rest is a blend of every race found across Khorvaire. Halflings, elves, and gnomes all have a significant presence in the city, but even kalashtar and changelings have communities in Sharn. Beyond the permanent population, tens of thousands of people pass through Sharn every day. Refugees from the war still find their way to the city, along with tourists, spies, merchants, and folk hoping to find their fortune in the grandest city in Eberron.

Sharn stands above the Dagger River and its eastern tributary, the Hilt. It's an important port for anyone dealing with Aerenal, Xen'drik, or Sarlona. Mountains line the shores of the Dagger, and Sharn can't spread out. So instead it has grown ever upward.

The city is primarily made up of these quarters:

- Central Plateau  
- Dura  
- Menthis Plateau  
- Northedge  
- Tavick's Landing  

At the hub of each of these quarters is a cluster of enormous core towers. A web of bridges and platforms connects many of these vast spires, and smaller turrets sprout from the edges of the core towers. The district of Skyway floats above the highest towers, while the tunnels of the Cogs stretch out below the lower city.

In between those extremes, each of the quarters is divided into an upper ward, a middle ward, and a lower ward. Each ward is made up of a number of districts, so that the location of a place in Sharn can be expressed with a combination of a ward name and a district name. More information about each of the wards and the districts in them appears later in this chapter.

### Aftermath of War

Far from the front lines, Sharn never fell under siege during the Last War. Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue to even today.

#### Physical Damage

Although Sharn was never subjected to a sustained assault, it didn't avoid damage. On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant attacks inside Sharn. The most infamous of these was the Aundairian attack that brought down the floating Glass Tower, devastating the district now known as Fallen. In any of the lower or middle wards, you might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during the war.

#### Psychological Scars

There are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the actions of other nations. For example, many of the residents of Dura hold all Aundairians responsible for the destruction of Fallen. In another district, folk could hate the Karrns for an undead attack that occurred during the war, and a different group could blame Thrane for the siege of Vathirond. These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment toward particular nations. For instance, on an individual level, most members of the Sharn Watch might not care about a gnoll being seen in a neighborhood, but a guard who fought on the Droaam front during the war might be out for revenge. Warforged are sometimes also the targets of this sort of prejudice; a person whose friends were killed by warforged soldiers might resent all such creatures.

#### Shortages

Because the ink is barely dry on the Treaty of Thronehold and relationships between the signatories are still being normalized, Sharn doesn't currently benefit from a lot of commerce with other nations. Problems could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be available only through the Boromar Clan.

#### Refugees and Victims

Cyran refugees have filled the district of High Walls in Lower Tavick's Landing beyond capacity, and Sharn is also home to a significant number of refugees from elsewhere in Breland—people whose homes and villages were destroyed during the war, and who have come to Sharn in search of new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards. They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance against those they blame for their pain.

## Guide to the City

> When you live on the inside low, you never see the sun. People hear "towers," they think of graceful little spires, the sort of thing you see poking up in the corner of your lord's keep. We've got those, and lots of 'em. But the foundation of the city is the core towers. The walls of these towers are so thick you could fit your lord's castle in one.

> [!quote]-  
> 
> You've got your outside districts where you get the open air, built on the bridges and platforms that connect the core towers together. You've got the little turrets, built on the core tower walls and the bridges between. You've got the folk in the middle, who live and work in the walls themselves. And then you've got those of us on the inside, our districts entirely contained in the hollow well of a great tower. When you look up in Callestan, you see twinkling lights, to be sure. But those aren't stars, and that isn't the sky. You're looking up through a mile of bridges and platforms crossing the well, looking up at the districts above you.

> [!quote]- A quote from A street urchin describing Sharn  
> 
> You live up high, you can touch the sky. In the middle you can still see the sun. Down on the inside low, all we have is gloom and the constant drip, water and worse descending from the city above us.

Sharn is the most cosmopolitan city on the continent. Describing all the activities and offerings in the city could fill an entire book. Here's a summary of what you need to know to appreciate the city to the fullest.

### Watch Your Step!

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—Watch for Falling Drunks
> 
> Just this week a Brelish woman in Middle Central was squashed to death when a drunk Cyran man fell on her from the upper wards. He survived. A good Brelish woman, a veteran of the Last War, cushioned his fall!
> 
> This incident isn't the first of its kind. Last month a clumsy warforged crushed two innocent halfling lovers. Before that, a shifter thief fell from a tower, injuring an unsuspecting griffon. I propose a new law: No traveling the middle or upper wards without a feather token. These affordable trinkets are all that stand between our safety and death caused by some rat who would rather spend gold on drink.
^the-sharn-inquisitivewatch-for-falling-drunks

As befits the City of Towers, Sharn is also a city of bridges and balconies. These thoroughfares and outcroppings can be extremely narrow or comfortably wide. Although most of them are bounded by walls or railings, there's always a chance that during your time in Sharn, you or someone you know will go over the edge. So, how do residents cope with this risk?

Those who can afford it usually carry a [feather token](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/feather-token-erlw.md) as insurance. No token? Don't panic! Because of the maze of bridges and spans connecting the towers, there's an excellent chance that you won't fall more than a hundred feet before impacting on a lower bridge. Though this alone might seem like small comfort, it's also true that the major bridges in the upper and middle wards are enchanted with [feather fall](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/feather-fall.md) effects that trigger automatically, keeping you from crushing an innocent passerby in your descent.

Many different outcomes could follow a lengthy fall. The Falling in Sharn table presents a few possibilities.

![Watch Your Step!; Falling in Sharn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/watch-your-step-falling-in-sharn-erlw.md)

### Communication Services

Need to get a message to someone? If you're not in a hurry, the Orien post has boxes throughout the city; you can mail a letter for 1 cp. Hiring a courier generally costs between 5 cp and 5 gp, depending on the size of the package and where you need it delivered. You can find Sivis message stations in almost every upper and middle ward, and if you absolutely have to contact someone instantly, the Sivis enclave in the Dragon Towers district (Middle Central) can perform a [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell for 200 gp.

House Tharashk has brought an innovation to message delivery in Sharn: the use of [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md). Tharashk has several of these creatures in its employ, and these flying couriers are a quick way to get a message across the city. If you spot a gargoyle without a burden, you can flag it down, and it costs 5 gp to deliver a letter or a small package.

### Spellcasting Services

Magewrights and adepts can be found in every district of Sharn, selling their services. Standard prices are summarized on the Magewright Casting Fees table.

![Spellcasting Services; Magewright Casting Fees](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/spellcasting-services-magewright-casting-fees-erlw.md)

These costs can vary depending on the spell and the spellcaster, and they don't include the price of expensive components. People who can cast higher-level spells are rare, typically found only in the dragonmarked houses or the wizard circles; the cost and availability of such services varies based on the caster.

> [!note] Lifestyle and Standards of Living
> 
> In Sharn, as in any large community, different segments of the population occupy different places in the economic spectrum. The terms that D&D uses to quantify lifestyle expenses—wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy, and aristocratic (see ""Expenses"" in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook")—are also used in this chapter as an indicator of what it costs for someone to live in a given area, and also of the costs of goods and services there.
> 
> For instance, a restaurant that is said to serve food of comfortable quality is one where a patron who lives a comfortable lifestyle (or better) can afford anything on the menu.
^lifestyle-and-standards-of-living

### Education and Research

Morgrave University, though not the most respectable institution of higher learning in Khorvaire, has an extensive library that boasts definitive collections of lore in certain fields, particularly arcana, dungeoneering, geography, and history. Characters seeking knowledge in any of these fields or others ought to be able to find resources in the library to aid their search. The university is an excellent source of sages who hire their services out on a short- or long-term basis. Even those who profess to be sages but have no connection to the university tend to cluster around Morgrave, with their homes and businesses almost all located in the University, Den'iyas, and Ivy Towers districts of Upper Menthis.

Another important site for certain kinds of research is the City Archive, in the Highest Towers district of Upper Central. The archive contains exhaustive historical documents of Sharn; birth, death, and marriage records; and copies of legal documents such as identification papers and letters of marque issued in the city. Access to these records, however, is more restricted than to the contents of the Morgrave library.

Those who want to further their research through some hands-on experience might find undiscovered lore in the lowest regions of Sharn, where sewers and tunnels snake through ancient ruins. Similarly, the crypts of the City of the Dead might hold some relevant historical information.

### Shopping Centers

Sharn contains a number of major shopping districts. The Tradefair district in Middle Central focuses on top-quality goods—everything you'll need to maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle. North Market in Lower Northedge has a fine selection of common goods. Almost anything can be found in the Bazaar of Middle Dura, as long as you're not concerned about the origin of secondhand goods. Tavick's Market in Middle Tavick's Landing is a center for produce and other goods brought in from the farms and artisan workshops outside Sharn.

### Healing

House Jorasco operates houses of healing throughout the city, largely in the middle and upper wards. The Panaceum in Dragon Towers (Middle Central) is the primary Jorasco enclave. The houses' services use the prices in this book's introduction.

The Panaceum has an altar that can be used to perform [raise dead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/raise-dead.md), but this service isn't without its risks. Sometimes the wrong spirit returns to a body, or malevolent ghosts or wraiths might escape from the netherworld along with the person being raised. Before the healers take gold to perform a resurrection, a Jorasco adept will first cast [augury](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md). If this divination indicates looming disaster, the adept will reject the request.

A few divine spellcasters in Sharn can raise the dead, notably the high priest of the Undying Court in Shae Lias. These devout clerics rarely sell their services, however, and the high priest would need a compelling reason to help someone who has different beliefs.

### Holidays

There's always a celebration happening or about to happen in Sharn, whether it's a parade in a single district or a festival that ranges across the entire city. Here are a few special occasions to put on your calendar.

#### The Tain Gala (First Far of each month)

The ir'Tains are the richest and most powerful family in Sharn. Each month, Lady Celyria ir'Tain holds a ball at her Skyway mansion. The guest list defines the current social order of the city; those families who hold permanent invitations, known as the Sixty, are the de facto royalty of Sharn. Celyria does invite unusual guests and attractions each month, and an up-and-coming entertainer or a renowned folk hero might catch her notice.

#### Crystalfall (9 Olarune)

During the Last War, saboteurs caused a floating tower to fall into Lower Dura. This devastation can still be seen today in the district now known as Fallen. On 9 Olarune, people gather to remember those who were lost that day. Many of them carry on a tradition of crafting elaborate ice sculptures and throwing them into the Dagger River.

#### The Day of Mourning (20 Olarune)

The nation of Cyre was destroyed in 994 YK on this date, known as the Day of Mourning. Although that event had an impact on everyone in Khorvaire, this day of remembrance is especially significant to Cyran survivors. It is a time when Cyrans come together to recall their lost kingdom. Some tell stories or sing traditional songs, ensuring that their culture isn't forgotten. Other survivors still seethe with anger at the enemies who brought Cyre down, and thus far the holiday has been marked by a brief upturn in violence.

#### Sun's Blessing (15 Therendor)

The festival of Dol Arrah is a day of peace and a time when enemies are urged to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts. It's one of the safest days in the city for visitors and residents alike.

#### Aureon's Crown (26 Dravago)

Elders share their knowledge with the young during this celebration. Morgrave University holds its graduate services on this day, and a day-long schedule of public lectures is presented at the Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis.

#### Brightblade (12 Nymm)

The festival of Dol Dorn is noted across the city with prizefights, wrestling matches, archery contests, and other tests of strength and skill. This activity culminates with a grand contest of champions in the Cornerstone district in Middle Tavick's Landing.

#### The Race of Eight Winds (23 Lharvion)

This event is an aerial race that takes place around Dura Quarter.

#### The Hunt (4 Barrakas)

In honor of the Sovereign Balinor, a fierce beast is brought to the city and released on this day into an isolated section of Old Sharn. Anyone can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 5 gp; the hunter (or group) who brings down the beast wins a purse of 500 gp and the blessing of Balinor. The motif of the Hunt can vary; in some years, multiple beasts are released, and the hunter who catches the most of them is the victor. In any case, it often turns out that the other competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.

#### Fathen's Fall (25 Barrakas)

This celebration commemorates a priest of the Silver Flame who was martyred while exposing lycanthropes in Sharn. The day's activities often cause tension with the shifter community.

#### Boldrei's Feast (9 Rhaan)

Gatherings across the city mark this celebration of community. The wealthy compete to throw the grandest parties, and the most generous among them will be remembered throughout the year for their largesse.

#### The Ascension (1 Sypheros)

The sacrifice of Tira Miron, who gave her life to serve as the Voice of the Silver Flame, is honored on this day. The holiday is marked by services at all Silver Flame churches and shrines, and the faithful are encouraged to find some way to help their communities.

#### Wildnight (18–19 Sypheros)

Supposedly the Fury, the god of Passion and Revenge, reaches the height of her power on this night. Emotions run high, and impulse control runs low. Shy and superstitious folk stay indoors, while others see it as a time to cast aside inhibitions. The streets fill with revelry that lasts well into the night.

#### Thronehold (11 Aryth)

This observance marks the day that the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, officially ending the Last War. This year (998 YK) is only the second time the event has been commemorated, and the Lord Mayor of Sharn has promised a truly epic festival.

#### Long Shadows (26–28 Vult)

It's said that the power of the Shadow, the sinister deity of the Dark Six, is at its height during these three nights. Careful people spend this time indoors with friends, but those who relish the darkness might decide to take to the streets to prey on the weak and foolish.

### Sports and Games

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—the Race of Eight Winds Begins!
> 
> Banners are flying across Dura today, and the streets are full of color. Walk through Oldkeep wearing brown and red, and you'll be invited to raise a glass to the Griffon; if you're dressed in white and gold, the colors of the Hippogriff, you'd best be prepared to defend yourself.
> 
> If you're new to Sharn, you might think our city's gone mad. And in some ways it has, but it's a madness that reaches its peak every summer with the Race of Eight Winds. Long ago, King Galifar used Dura as a proving ground for aerial calvary. What's more important, quickness or strength? Our modern race is a test of speed and skill through a course that weaves around and through the spires of Dura. There are eight competitors, and each of these brave jockeys rides a different flying creature—except for the gargoyle Carralag, who relies on his own wings!
> 
> Speed is important, but merely surviving the race can be a challenge. The spilling of blood isn't prohibited, but the only weapon a rider can carry is a light sporting crossbow; the steeds can use their talons and beaks, which is what makes the Griffon such a fierce contender. Poison, magic, or anything else that would directly interfere with beast or rider is strictly forbidden—though over the years we've certainly seen imaginative attempts to stretch the rules!
> 
> Dura is divided into eight regions for the race, each of which is represented by a different creature. If you're going to spend time in Dura, it's best that you know your mounts! The beasts of Upper Dura are the fastest in the race, and overall have the best record. The reigning champion is the Pegasus of Highwater, whose supporters wear white and silver. The Hippogriff is tied to Overlook and Daggerwatch in Upper Dura, and its colors are white and gold. Detractors often say that the Sharn Watch favors the Hippogriff and that House Vadalis helps the Pegasus, but the referees always insist that the race is fair.
> 
> The beasts of Middle Dura are versatile. The Eagle represents Broken Arch and Stormhold in Middle Dura, and its supporters wear brown and gold. The clever Owl flies for Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. The Hawk represents Tumbledown and Underlook in Middle Dura, and wearing its blend of tan and brown can usually get you a good price at an inn.
> 
> The beasts of Lower Dura are more infamous than reliable. The Griffon flies for Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. It has never won the race, but there's gold to be made betting on which opponent it will bring down. The Glidewing represents Gate of Gold and The Stores, and its supporters wear green and gray; many believe that the Boromar Clan pays for the upkeep of the mount and its rider. Malleon's Gate used to be represented by the Bat, but twelve years ago they exchanged that mascot for the Gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. The current [Gargoyle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) is a stone-faced fellow named Carralag, and his supporters are quite passionate about their winged champion.
^the-sharn-inquisitivethe-race-of-eight-winds-begins

As befits a metropolis that boasts people of all cultures, Sharn hosts a wide variety of sports and athletic events. The Race of Eight Winds occurs once a year. Other events take place on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. For instance, shifters hold informal hrazhak competitions every night in Lower Northedge. The ogres of the Cogs are fond of tugs-of-war, arm wrestling, and similarly simple tests of strength. People who want to bet on sports can usually find a gambler willing to set odds in the Firelight district in Lower Menthis, Callestan in Lower Dura, Cornerstone in Middle Tavick's Landing, or Hareth's Folly in Middle Dura. Three exotic sports practiced in the city are described below.

#### Hrazhak

Two teams of seven shifters play hrazhak on a field with a goal at each end. Each team starts out carrying a wooden idol. To score, a team must steal its opponent's idol and place both idols in its own goal. Obstacles such as trees, streams, and piles of rubble can be present on a hrazhak field, requiring the competitors to make full use of their jumping and climbing abilities. Idols can be thrown or carried, and there are no limits on contact between participants, although only natural weapons are allowed. Typically, a low-level druid or adept is on hand to provide healing if needed—but any competitor who receives aid is removed from play for the remainder of the match. Competitors aren't allowed to use spells or similar abilities.

The only formal hrazhak arena in Sharn is located in the Stone Trees, part of the Cornerstone district, where the matches serve as both a spectator sport and a reason for gambling. Shifters created temporary hrazhak fields in the slums and warehouse districts of the city from time to time, and shifter youths often play impromptu games in the parks.

#### Skyblades

Common jousting is popular enough throughout Breland, but in Sharn, the sport has taken to the air. In a formal skyblades match, the goal is to knock an opposing rider from the saddle—attacks against mounts are forbidden, along with the use of magic or other supernatural abilities. Formal matches take place in one of Sharn's two aerial arenas, in Cornerstone and Hareth's Folly. Skyblades jousters typically ride [hippogriffs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hippogriff.md) and carry blunted lances that deal nonlethal damage.

Informal matches, which don't always use the same rules, occur from time to time in Lower and Middle Dura, Tavick's Landing, and Menthis Plateau. An informal match might be played out across an entire district, with competitors weaving between towers and around bridges. The rules for an informal match are set before the start, establishing (among other things) whether magic can be used and mounts can be targeted.

#### Six Stones

A Droaam tradition brought to Sharn by immigrants, six stones is a game for seven competitors, who each pay a base stake. The seven are then sealed in a large chamber with a [cockatrice](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/cockatrice.md). The match ends when six of the players have been turned to stone, at which point the survivor is awarded all the stakes (except for a share set aside for the organizers). A [medusa](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md) handler monitors the competition to ensure that rules are followed. Contestants carry no arms or armor, and no magic or supernatural abilities may be used. Additionally, no one is allowed to attack the cockatrice. The challenge lies in outlasting the other contestants and luring them or pushing them into the path of the cockatrice. The battleground might be barren or littered with rubble and cover; it might be lit, or it could be be pitch black.

Six stones matches are staged by the criminal organization Daask (see the ""Criminal Activities"" section later in this chapter). The sport is illegal, but the games go on because the matches are confined to Lower Dura and the Cogs and well hidden from the eyes of the Watch. A match usually occurs only once every few months. Sometimes participants voluntarily enter the competition, but most are debtors who have been offered a chance to pay off their loans by winning the match. Daask takes bets on the outcome, and usually earns a tidy sum as its share of the proceeds.

### City Government

Sharn has many people in positions of power: beadles, ministers, bailiffs, and all manner of minor functionaries and officials. But ultimate power rests in the hands of the City Council. That body has seventeen members: one for each ward in the city, plus representatives from Skyway and the Cogs. Each ward has its own process for selecting a councilor, and there are no legal restrictions on who can govern; if you build up a strong base of support in a ward, you could hold the position yourself!

The members of the City Council are quite diverse. Some are crooked, others are idealists, and one of them appears to be an owl. All of them are well known in their home wards, and any of them could have use for a team of adventurers. The Sharn Councilors table describes a few of the city leaders you might bump into in Upper Central or at the Tain Gala. If your character has the noble background, you might already know one of them.

![City Government; Sharn Councilors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/city-government-sharn-councilors-erlw.md)

### Temples and Shrines

Every major religion has outposts in Sharn. A number of sacred sites draw pilgrims to the city from across Breland and Khorvaire. Priests don't usually sell their services; temples are places for worship and spiritual guidance.

The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, represented by shrines and small temples throughout the city. The Pavilion of the Host in Middle Central is the heart of the faith, and most priests of the Host live in one of the Pavilion's nine towers. Pilgrims often come to visit one of three particular sites. The Korranath in Upper Central features Khorvaire's largest temple of Kol Korran. The Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis draws scholars and worshipers alike. The Pool of Onatar's Tears in the Blackbones district of the Cogs is said to impart a blessing to any smith who bathes their hands in its waters.

The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame, Sharn's largest temple to the Silver Flame, is located in Upper Central. Archierophant Ythana Morr is frequently accused of corruption and nepotism, but there are smaller places of worship around the city devoted to the true principles of the faith. The hermit Gaia watches over the City of the Dead from Warden Tower. Coldflame Keep in Middle Northedge was once a mighty garrison; its glory has faded, but Flamebearer Mazin Tana still strives to protect his community. The priestess Faela maintains a small shrine in the shadows of Fallen, doing what she can to help the wretched people of that forsaken district. Finally, the Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is a sacred site in North Market, often visited by templars passing through the city.

Even some lesser known religions are represented in Sharn. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is a haven for followers of the Blood of Vol. The Gates of Passage in Upper Northedge is a temple of the Undying Court. The Overlook district of Upper Dura holds the Shrine of il-Yannah, dedicated to the Path of Light.

### Guilds and Groups

Guilds and similar associations abound in Sharn. Their headquarters are places where people can find the company of fellow professionals, or perhaps enlist the assistance of an organization.

All the guilds associated with the dragonmarked houses are well represented in Sharn; most have guildhalls in the Dragon Towers district of Middle Central. Aside from those groups, the city features a number of less populous associations, such as those described below.

#### Adventurer's Guilds

Sharn is a magnet for those who seek adventure and opportunity. Forgotten treasures are hidden in the ruins below the towers, and expeditions leave for Xen'drik every day. At any moment, dozens of sages, spies, and nobles around the city are searching for capable agents to help with their schemes and investigations. If you and your friends are searching for adventure, you've come to the right place, and you don't have to do it alone. Sharn is home to two organizations that provide adventurers with opportunities for work and camaraderie: the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild and the Deathsgate Guild.

##### Membership Benefits

Those who are accepted into either adventurer's guild must pay dues of 12 gp each year. The primary benefit of belonging to a guild is access to work, since the guildmaster can connect parties of adventurers with patrons and jobs suited to their talents. Beyond that, there are a few additional benefits:

- You can store items at the guildhall free of charge.  
- You can book lodging at the guildhall for 5 sp per night. The accommodations are modest, but the guild provides stronger security for lodgers and their possessions than you'd find at an inn.  
- An adventurer's guild is an excellent source of information. By studying records and working with other guild members, you can gain advantage on any skill check to research a subject in which the guild has expertise or experience.  

A strong rivalry exists between the Deathsgate Guild and the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. You might have trouble with members of the opposing guild, whether in the form of drunken boasting in a tavern or a rival stirring up trouble in the midst of a mission.

##### The Clifftop Adventurer's Guild

Located in the Clifftop district of Upper Dura, this organization has a sterling reputation as a source of reliable explorers and champions. Clifftop adventurers are known for their courage and integrity, and guildmaster Summer Korranor holds members to a high standard of virtuous behavior. As a Clifftop adventurer, you're expected to keep your word, to stand by your comrades, to uphold the law, and never to intentionally endanger innocents with your actions. Many of the local businesses cater to adventurers, and if you're a member of the guild, you can expect a warm welcome in the taverns of Clifftop.

##### The Deathsgate Guild

Adventurers who are willing to take on any job and to do whatever it takes to triumph might find themselves suited for membership in the Deathsgate Guild. Named for its proximity to the City of the Dead, the district of Deathsgate prides itself on being a haven for those who challenge death on a daily basis. The guild's founder, Kassh "Blackaxe" Droranath, doesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as they don't fail.

#### The Circle of Song

A bard is a versatile individual, equally skilled at entertainment and espionage. These talents are perfectly matched to the city of Sharn, which is both the cultural heart of Breland and a nexus for intrigue and diplomacy. Bards have much to gain from the company of other bards, as they exchange news, stories, and songs. For this purpose, long ago a group of the finest bards in Sharn founded the Circle of Song, an alliance of entertainers and adventurers.

The Circle of Song is an informal organization, open to any bard who knows its customs and who can find an outpost. It has no membership dues; you're expected to make a donation if you make significant use of the group's resources. Membership provides the following benefits:

- You can always find food and lodging at a circle outpost, though you might be expected to entertain the patrons in exchange. If times are tough, your food and lodging might be a step lower than the usual quality of the inn, but at least it's free.  
- You have advantage on ability checks made to perform research or gather information while in a circle outpost, provided you have an opportunity to peruse archives and talk with other members.  
- Circle members are often willing to do minor favors for other members—gathering information, embarrassing a minor noble, causing a distraction. There's no cost for such a service, but anyone who helps you will expect you to provide similar assistance when they need it.  

The first and oldest outpost of the Circle of Song is the Golden Horn in the University district of Upper Menthis; a few bards are almost always in residence and willing to share news and stories. Other, less elaborate outposts are maintained in Sharn, and over the centuries the circle has established outposts in most major cities and many smaller communities across Khorvaire. These sites are usually taverns or inns that have hidden areas accessible only to members of the circle.

Bards are expected to set aside personal rivalries while in a circle outpost, and any kind of combat or violence is prohibited. Violating this rule results in immediate expulsion from the circle, at the least.

#### Arcane Orders

Its mighty towers and floating spires mark Sharn as a symbol of mystic power and achievement. Soon after the founding of the city, the greatest wizards of Breland chose it to be the seat of their arcane order. Its goal was to celebrate excellence in the mystic arts, bringing together the greatest practitioners of magic in a society that rivals Arcanix and the institutions of Aundair.

A schism split the original society, but today both of the branches of the original organization, the Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, are recognized and respected throughout Breland. Each one has lesser halls in every major city in the nation.

##### Membership Benefits

Someone accepted into an arcane order must pay 1,000 gp to join, with ongoing dues of 250 gp each year thereafter. With this payment comes many benefits, including the following:

- You can stay at the order's hall in any major city and enjoy the amenities of a wealthy lifestyle free of charge.  
- For as long as you have access to the order's hall, the cost of crafting a magic item at the site is reduced by 10 percent.  
- While in the hall, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) checks, as well as any ability checks involving arcane research.  
- Membership in an arcane order grants prestige within Breland. Though this status provides no tangible benefit, it proves that you are a gifted mage and stand above any mere magewright or dabbler.  

##### The Esoteric Order of Aureon

Members of the larger of the two societies, the Esoteric Order of Aureon, take a vow to use their talents to preserve and advance civilization and to operate within the confines of the law. The Esoteric Order helped Galifar I maintain the rule of law, and many of its members served Breland during the Last War. Although its members aren't prohibited from studying any form of magic, the specialties of the order are abjuration, divination, and evocation magic. Wizards and artificers are almost always welcome in the guild. Sorcerers must prove their grasp of arcane theory to earn a place, and warlocks are rarely accepted as members. The hall of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is in the district of Clifftop in Upper Dura.

##### The Guild of Starlight and Shadows

Breland's other arcane order encourages independence and innovation, qualities that contribute to a mutually uncomfortable relationship between the Guild of Starlight and Shadows and the Sharn Watch. The schools of conjuration, enchantment, and illusion are favored by this group. Warlocks, especially those of the Archfey, are generally welcome. Members of the Esoteric Order look down on Starlight wizards, and in turn the guild members often mock the wizards of the Esoteric Order and play pranks on them. The Guild of Starlight and Shadows has its hall in the Deathsgate district in Middle Tavick's Landing.

##### The Closed Circle

There is one dark stain in the shared history of the arcane orders. Three hundred years ago, a third order arose in Sharn—a sinister cabal called the Closed Circle. This order specialized in transmutation and necromancy and dabbled in the forbidden lore of the daelkyr and the Dragon Below. It's said that the members of the Closed Circle went mad and sought to summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild was wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the combined action of the Church of the Silver Flame, the Esoteric Order, and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows. Hidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still be found in Sharn, where vengeful liches or other wizards of the Circle practice their dark arts in hiding.

## Wards of Sharn

Sharn is a vertical city, and elevation is an indicator of status and wealth. Each quarter is roughly divided into three levels, and the combination of quarter and level defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as Lower Dura, Upper Central, and Middle Menthis.

Upper wards are the domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle might be treated with disdain (suffering disadvantage on Charisma checks).

Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the Sharn Watch actively patrols these areas. Although the guards here might be corrupt just as in a middle or lower ward, they're already being well paid by powerful nobles and criminal organizations, and they work efficiently in the service of these forces.

Middle wards are home to the middle classes. Here you'll find bustling markets and taverns, along with a wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods and services are affordable by those of a modest or comfortable lifestyle, with a few higher-priced options tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a presence, but not as strong as in the upper wards.

Lower wards house the hard-working laborers, along with the destitute and the desperate, including refugees who lost everything in the war and orphans who never had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are home to those who have no better than a poor lifestyle; a visitor who displays signs of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle might attract unwanted attention. The watch pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a haven for criminals and gangs.

These are stereotypes that don't apply to all wards. Dura is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that Upper Dura is effectively a middle ward in economic terms; similarly, because Central Plateau is a hub of wealth and power, Lower Central is effectively a middle ward.

Each ward is further subdivided into districts, which are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a separate culture, or both. For example, Lower Northedge includes the districts of Stoneyard, Longstairs, and North Market. It's generally true that the combination of a district's ward and quarter will give you a broad idea of what to expect there. A district in Upper Central will typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while a district in Lower Dura will be squalid and dangerous.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/099-3-04.webp#center)

### Getting Around

Sharn is an enormous city, and traveling on foot from one side of the city to the other can be time-consuming. Here are some travel-time guidelines:

- It takes at least 30 minutes to cross a ward.  
- If you're traveling between wards, add 30 minutes for each ward you pass through.  
- Dura and Tavick's Landing are especially large; double the time it takes to move through one of them.  

For instance, traveling from Lower Menthis to Upper Central involves passing through three wards (taking a bridge from Lower Menthis to Lower Central, then ascending two levels) and can take 90 minutes or longer.

Not all the quarters are linked to one another by bridges. The connections that do exist include these:

- Central Plateau has bridges that lead to Northedge and Menthis.  
- Dura is connected to Tavick's Landing and Menthis.  
- Tavick's Landing is connected to Dura, Menthis, and Northedge.  
- Menthis is connected to Tavick's Landing, Dura, and Central.  
- Northedge is connected to Central and Tavick's Landing.  

Traveling from district to district involves the use of bridges and ramps, along with magic lifts—vast floating disks that slowly ascend and descend along threads of mystical energy. Lifts are mainly used to move cargo and can be up to 30 feet in diameter. Most lifts have rails but aren't fully enclosed; if combatants fight on a lift, someone falling or being pushed off the edge is always a possibility.

For a speedier journey through the streets, House Orien manages a system of carriages for hire. Taking an Orien carriage cuts travel time in half and costs 2 cp per ward traveled. Flight is, of course, the fastest way to get around in Sharn, cutting travel time down to one-sixth of the walking pace (5 minutes per ward). It's also more expensive, at 2 sp per ward. The most common form of aerial transport is the skycoach, but many flying mounts, including [hippogriffs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hippogriff.md), [griffons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md), [pteranodons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/pteranodon.md), and [giant owls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md), can be found for hire around the city.

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—Who owns sharn? Portrait of The ir'Tains and the 60 Families
> 
> If you've read more than two issues of the *Sharn Inquisitive*, you've seen at least two stories about the ir'Tain family. King Boranel might rule Breland, and the Lord Mayor might be our highest appointed official, but the ir'Tains are the true royalty of our city. What citizen of Sharn doesn't have an opinion about the fate of Lord Dalian ir'Tain, lost at sea a decade ago? Many are sure that he's a prisoner of the sahuagin, which would explain why Lady Celyria has been funding expeditions into the sahuagin realms. Another camp maintains that Lord Dalian staged his death so he could embrace a swashbuckling life as a pirate king. If the truth ever comes out, you can be sure you'll read about it here!
> 
> Matriarch Lady Celyria ir'Tain is the queen of high society in Sharn. Her activities and those of the ir'Tain children account for just as much newsprint as their father used to. Dalian's eldest son, Dalas ir'Tain, shocked society last week when he publicly denounced the Brelish monarchy. The dalliances of younger siblings Cyra and Daral sell more issues of the *Inquisitive* whenever such are reported, and the wedding of middle sister Cariana ir'Tain and Mayne Jhaelian of Aerenal will surely be the biggest social event of 998 YK.
> 
> The ir'Tain fortune is tied to the City of Towers. Tain gold funded the construction of many of the towers of Sharn, and the family owns vast sections of the city. You've likely heard of the Sixty Families of Sharn, considered the guiding lights of the city. Most assume that these luminaries are ancient and established, their status tied to a royal decree. In fact, when the Tains built their mansion on Skyway, they ordered the architects to design a banquet hall that would seat sixty families and their servants. The original Sixty Families were those that received standing invitations to the first Tain Gala. Though the list has remained generally stable through the years, just last year Celyria expelled the ir'Moros family and gave their place to Saiden Boromar—a surprising advancement for a family that began as Cliffside hooligans.
> 
> Anyone who strives to rise in Sharn society must earn the favor of the Sixty. Similarly, those who seek to explore and adventure in the wake of the Last War can surely find patrons among these elite. And from our desks, we will be watching to see which families will be next to rise and fall.

## Central Plateau

The power and wealth of Sharn are concentrated in Central Plateau. Whether you're looking to deal with powerful merchants, city councilors, dragonmarked barons, or the ambassadors of other nations, Central Plateau is the place where big deals are made.

![Central Plateau: Noteworthy Locations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/central-plateau-noteworthy-locations-erlw.md)

### Upper Central

Gold and power flow down from Upper Central. The district of Highest Towers is the seat of government, where city hall and the municipal archives are located. The Korranath is the name of both the central financial district and the grand temple of Kol Korran that dominates it. This district also houses the Kundarak Bank of Sharn and the Vaults, House Kundarak's ostensibly impenetrable storage facility.

Some of Sharn's wealthiest citizens live in the Mithral Tower district, and Platinum Heights is the most expensive market district in Sharn. It has fewer shops than the Bazaar of Dura, but if you're looking for top-quality goods or services, there's no finer—or more expensive—source to be found.

If you maintain no better than a poor lifestyle, many people in Upper Central will assume you're a servant or vagrant; this could cause you to have disadvantage on Charisma checks involving residents.

### Middle Central

This part of the city is a center for intrigue. The district of Ambassador Towers contains embassies and consulates from the Thronehold Nations, as well as Aerenal and Sarlona. Ambassador Towers is also home to the King's Citadel, the headquarters of Brelish intelligence. Across the ward, the district of Dragon Towers holds the primary enclaves of the dragonmarked houses.

The Sovereign Towers district has the grandest temples in Sharn. The Pavilion of the Host is a complex of nine towers devoted to the Sovereign Host, and the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame is the seat of the religion. Although these temples are the locations of grand ceremonies and celebrations, many of the most devout priests serve in the city's smaller shrines.

### Lower Central

This district is peaceful and largely residential; it's the safest and most pleasant of the lower wards. Goods and services are largely priced for those with a comfortable lifestyle, and the Sharn Watch is plentiful and well paid. The district of Boldrei's Hearth has many reasonably priced inns (most run by House Ghallanda), and Olladra's Kitchen has a wide assortment of taverns and restaurants. Myshan Gardens is a residential district that caters to affluent artists, while Vallia Towers has a large community of half-elves.

### Things to Do in Central Plateau

Looking for work or amusement in this quarter? Some of the things you can do here include:

**Attend an auction**. The Aurora Gallery in Platinum Heights is the finest auction house in Sharn and specializes in auctions of exotic magic items and relics from Xen'drik. You never know what's going to be available—or who will be bidding against you.

**Plan a heist**. Perhaps your goals depend on recovering an item a villain has hidden in the vaults of Korranath. Can you penetrate the most secure facility in Sharn?

**Go to jail**. The King's Citadel in Ambassador Towers is also Sharn's high-security prison.

**Worship**. The primary temples of the Sovereign Host and the Silver Flame are located in Middle Central, along with a host of shrines to specific sovereigns and lesser faiths. Take part in a festival or drop in for some spiritual guidance!

**Engage in espionage**. Whether you work for your nation or get entangled in the schemes of the dragonmarked houses, Middle Central is home to a lot of powerful people who have a use for capable agents.

## Dura

Sharn began where Dura stands, but the city has left it behind in many ways. Many nowadays consider the oldest quarter of Sharn to be a blight on the City of Towers. The place is full of cracked and crumbling stonework, abandoned lift shafts, and everbright lanterns that have burned out and never been restored. Dura is riddled with poverty and crime; it's easily the most dangerous section of the city. But it also holds opportunities you can't find anywhere else. If you're looking for smuggled goods or a place to lie low, head to Dura.

![Dura Quarter: Noteworthy Locations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/dura-quarter-noteworthy-locations-erlw.md)

### Upper Dura

This ward is full of activity. Its people are prospering, but there's an edge of desperation about them; many folk are on the lookout for opportunities to better themselves. Upper Dura has the general properties of a middle ward, with most goods and services priced for a modest or comfortable lifestyle. The merchants and artisans are accustomed to dealing with unusual individuals, and adventurers receive a warm welcome here.

Clifftop is a home away from home for explorers and mercenaries. Daggerwatch is a fortress district, containing garrisons for the Sharn Watch and the Brelish army. The Gold & White is a Daggerwatch tavern that caters to Brelish soldiers; those who hold a Brelish military rank will receive a warm welcome, while those who served other nations would be wise to take their business elsewhere.

In the dwarven district of Highhold, a center of activity is Morragin's, which serves the strongest spirits in Sharn, but it's no mere tavern; often patronized by Mror merchants and Kundarak agents, it maintains the highest of standards (with prices to match).

The Highwater district is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of Dura and is the site of Pegasus Spire, the enclave of House Vadalis. The temple district of Hope's Peak features the Citadel of Light, a grand temple of Dol Arrah and a bastion for the virtuous. The Overlook district is home to Sharn's kalashtar community and includes the only temple of the Path of Light in Breland.

![The Drunken Dragon in Upper Dura](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/100-3-05.webp#center)

### Middle Dura

Middle Dura caters to the working class. Its taverns are modestly priced, but there's gold among the dross.

The Bazaar of Dura is the largest commercial district in Sharn. In addition to the dozens of permanent shops and smithies, the streets of the bazaar are an ever-changing tapestry of stalls and tents. It's said that you can find anything here, if you're not too worried about where it came from and if you're prepared to contend with the cutpurses that prey on the crowds.

A small selection of merchants that regularly do business at the bazaar is given on the Bazaar Merchants table; roll a `d10`, or choose a location of interest.

![Middle Dura; Bazaar Merchants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/middle-dura-bazaar-merchants-erlw.md)

Elsewhere in Middle Dura, the district of Hareth's Folly is a bizarre blend of architectural styles. One of the primary attractions is the Hollow Tower, an enormous arena that features aerial jousting and racing. The King of Fire is a grand tavern that hosts a broad range of gambling and bookmaking activities, legal and otherwise.

Many people make their homes in Middle Dura, even if their jobs take them elsewhere. Rattlestone and Tumbledown are mostly poor tenements. Stormhold contains crumbling manors still occupied by some of Sharn's oldest families, while many that have prospered have moved on to more prestigious districts.

### Lower Dura

The aptly named Precarious district in Lower Dura leans out over the edge of the cliffs, and the Skydocks—a system using gigantic arcane cranes and levitation—carry material up from Cliffside and the docks. Precarious is also filled with warehouses that hold these goods. Because Precarious plays an important role in the economy of the city, it's the only district in Lower Dura where the Sharn Watch maintains a significant presence.

The rest of Lower Dura, in stark contrast, has been left to rot. Ignored by the Watch, it is the domain of gangs and crime lords. The inhabitants of the ward are often protected from violence by their criminal connections or by virtue of having nothing worth stealing, but adventurers ought to tread lightly here, especially those who display the trappings of a wealthy lifestyle.

There was a time when Lower Dura was the heart of Sharn, and remnants of this glory remain. The Silvermist Theater in Callestan was built to entertain nobles. The ward boasted manors, temples, and a garrison for the watch. But all of these edifices were abandoned long ago, and now most are home to nothing but squatters and vermin.

The district of Callestan is a nexus of sorts, where all the major criminal powers of Sharn have a stake. Those groups are described in more detail later in this chapter.

The district of Fallen is a haunted ruin; this temple district was abandoned after it was struck by a falling tower. It's covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Malleon's Gate is home to the goblins of Sharn, along with other monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun. The district can be an especially dangerous place for halflings or anyone tied to the Boromar Clan.

Oldkeep and Gate of Gold are wretched tenement districts. A significant halfling community lives in the district known as The Stores, which is also a stronghold for the Boromar Clan.

### Things to Do in Dura

Dura is a quarter of extremes, from the nearly idyllic atmosphere of Upper Dura, down to the danger of Lower Dura. Among its attractions and diversions are these:

**Gamble**. Legal gambling is heavily taxed in the city and limited in its scope. Dura is the place to find a wide range of shadier and more profitable games.

**Go shopping**. The Bazaar of Middle Dura is an excellent source for exotic goods, legal or otherwise. Clifftop, in Upper Dura, caters to adventurers and has a reasonable selection of magical goods.

**Bend the law**. Looking for a fence or need to hire an assassin? Lower Dura is the nexus for criminal activities in Sharn.

**Talk about the race.** The inhabitants of Dura are devoted to the Race of Eight Winds and are always willing to discuss the latest news.

**Suffer a terrible accident.** The Sharn Watch ignores much of Lower Dura. Stories circulate continuously about dragonmarked houses and mad wizards conducting dangerous experiments in Lower Dura without interference from the law.

## Menthis Plateau

The hub of Sharn's entertainment industry and home to Breland's largest university, Menthis Plateau is one of the most diverse quarters in Sharn. Whether you're looking for classical theater, a fine bookstore, or an illegal fighting ring, Menthis has something to offer.

![Menthis Plateau: Noteworthy Locations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/menthis-plateau-noteworthy-locations-erlw.md)

### Upper Menthis

Elegant and civilized, Upper Menthis is home to four of the finest theaters in Breland: the cutting-edge Art Temple, the colorful Khavish Theater, the traditional Grand Stage, and the open-air Stargazer Theater, as well as the Kavarrah Concert Hall.

The shops in Upper Menthis deal mainly in fine food, fashion, and exotic goods. For instance, in the Seventh Tower district, Window on Yesterday, Echoes of the Past, the Mekdall Gallery, and Cloud Antiquities all buy and sell interesting antiques and trinkets from distant lands.

The district of Den'iyas is a gnome neighborhood that provides a glimpse into the culture of Zilargo. Davandi Fine Tailoring is the source of some of the finest glamerweave clothing in Khorvaire, and the district also hosts a number of businesses that specialize in alchemy, illusion, or divination. Visitors should be aware that intrigue is the primary pastime in Den'iyas, and that hapless adventures can easily find themselves pulled into intricate schemes or feuds.

Upper Menthis also contains the University district, home to Breland's finest institutions of learning. More information about this district can be found in "chapter 1".

### Middle Menthis

Middle Menthis boasts the most diverse population of any ward in Sharn. The Little Plains district is the destination for halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Cassan Bridge has a significant population of orcs and half-orcs from the Shadow Marches. Immigrants from the Lhazaar Principalities have settled in the Warden Towers district, which is primarily a garrison for the Sharn Watch. The district of Smoky Towers had a significant Cyran community even before the Last War; now, this area has become a haven for Cyrans wealthy enough to escape the refugee camps of High Walls.

One of the most prominent attractions In Smoky Towers is the Classic Theater. The place lives up to its name by staging only traditional works written before the start of the Last War. Although the Grand Stage in the University district also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works.

The Everbright district might be of particular interest to adventurers. A wide assortment of magewrights ply their trade here, and the shops have a good selection of magic items (of common and uncommon rarity). The people of Middle Menthis are law-abiding folk; visitors looking for spellcasters to help with illegal activities or who want to sell stolen artifacts will likely have better luck in Lower Dura.

### Lower Menthis

Providing cheap entertainment for the masses, Lower Menthis is crowded. The Firelight district is filled with sketchy taverns and theaters ranging from the innocent to the risque, as well as gambling halls, brothels, and spontaneous performances in the streets.

Lower Menthis is also home to the Burning Ring, a fight club where spectators bet on amateur gladiators. Technically illegal, the Burning Ring moves around the ward. Competitors are armed but unarmored; matches continue until a contestant yields, but fatalities do happen.

### What's on the Bill?

People come from across Breland to experience the Menthis art scene. All manner of entertainment can be found in this quarter, from bawdy Lower Menthis events to the traditional works of the Classic Theater in Middle Menthis. The Shows in Menthis table provides a sampling of the many performances staged in Menthis.

![What's on the Bill?; Shows in Menthis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/whats-on-the-bill-shows-in-menthis-erlw.md)

### Things to Do in Menthis Plateau

Any list of attractions that tries to summarize what Menthis Plateau has to offer, even without considering all the performance events, is doomed to be incomplete. Of the countless possibilities, some of the most popular reasons to come here are the following:

**Consult a sage**. Morgrave University might not be the finest institute of learning in Khorvaire, but it's the best Sharn has to offer. Whether you want to conduct your own research in the library or find a specialist in goblin history, Morgrave likely has what you need.

**Go into show business.** Menthis has a wide range of performance venues, from the Grand Stage to the many taverns of Lower Menthis. In addition to enjoying the entertainment, you could try to find work—either showcasing your artistic talents on stage or displaying another sort of prowess in the Burning Ring.

**Join an expedition**. Scholars at Morgrave often sponsor expeditions to Xen'drik and into the ruins below Sharn. Cyran nobles in Smoky Towers sometimes hire brave souls to venture into the Mournland to reclaim lost treasures.

**See other cultures**. Den'iyas brings a touch of Zilargo to Sharn. You might find a clawfoot raptor running down the streets in Little Plains, or a Gatekeeper druid casting bones on Cassan Bridge.

## Northedge

The Northedge residential area is the quietest quarter of Sharn. At first glance there's little to attract adventurous sorts, unless someone is interested in purchasing top-quality real estate. At the same time, you never know when this charming and innocuous area could be the site of a nefarious cult or a devilish plot.

![Northedge Quarter: Noteworthy Locations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/northedge-quarter-noteworthy-locations-erlw.md)

### Upper Northedge

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—Enigma of the Diamond voice
> 
> I challenge anyone to leave a performance of *The Broken Sword* with dry eyes. I believe that even a warforged would be moved to tears by this unflinching look at the spiritual cost of war. It's brutal, painful, and true—which is why it was all the more shocking when it first opened at the Diamond Theater. The Downstairs district of Lower Menthis is mainly known for its bawdy entertainment and base comedy, not cutting-edge political commentary. Thus, we critics assumed that this dramatic work was a singular event, until a new play titled *Fallen Angels* exceeded our every expectation. Month after month in recent times, the Diamond has struck us to the quick with emotional works about the Last War and the psychic wounds we're still struggling with.
> 
> Who is the playwright of the Diamond Theater responsible for these stirring stories? Her name is Luca Syara, but beyond that, she's an enigma. There's no such person on the rolls of the bardic colleges of Breland, and House Phiarlan and House Thuranni claim to know nothing about her. Syara shuns the spotlight and refuses all interviews. While her works are being debated and celebrated in classrooms and taverns, the artist spends her days in the dingy back rooms of the Diamond Theater. This seclusion has led to a number of fanciful rumors. Some say Syara fought in the Last War and that she was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning. A wilder rumor maintains that she is an exile from the Faerie Court of Thelanis, an archfey bound to human form.
> 
> While we wait for answers to this mystery, we encourage you to sample Syara's latest work. *Five Lives* is a gutwrenching tragedy that forces us to look at our darkest hours, and to consider the suffering of our enemies and the common threads that unite us all. If you're looking to forget your troubles, by all means, go see *Facade* or *The Late Count*. But if you want to take in a performance that might make you a better person, do whatever it takes to get tickets to *Five Lives*.
^the-sharn-inquisitiveenigma-of-the-diamond-voice

Upper Northedge is the perfect place for the noble who can afford a manor in the clouds but wants to avoid the bustle of Upper Central. The districts of Crystal Bridge and Oak Towers are filled with spire-topped manors and grand estates. A host of rooftop parks and gardens provide lovely spaces to sit and reflect.

Shae Lias is arguably the most remarkable district of Upper Northedge. Its population is largely composed of elves, and it is a bastion of Aereni culture and traditions. The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The priests of the Undying Court don't share this information with outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine power—resides in the temple.

Other points of interest in Shae Lias include the Oaks, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, which serves food of the highest quality (and priced accordingly). The Veil of Flesh specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge of death.

### Middle Northedge

This ward caters to the middle class of Sharn, offering a wide range of comfortable housing. Dwarves make up most of the population, with the highest concentration in the district of Holdfast. In contrast to the residents of Highhold in Upper Dura, the dwarves of Holdfast have deep roots in Sharn and feel no strong connection to the Mror Holds or its traditions.

High Hope is a temple district; although the city's most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it's commonly known that if you're looking for a truly devoted priest, you should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is Daca's Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn't claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she's blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign's voice. True or not, Daca's advice has proven to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist attraction.

### Lower Northedge

Although it's poverty-stricken, Lower Northedge is a significant step up from the slums of Lower Dura. The people of Lower Northedge don't look for trouble, and they don't like it coming to their doorstep. North Market is one of the largest markets in Sharn, though in contrast to the Bazaar of Dura it mostly offers simple, everyday goods.

Lower Northedge has a significant shifter population. The Rat's Nest is a tavern that caters to shifters, and the Bear's Rest is an inn run by a family of shifters. Tooth & Nail is an apothecary specializing in the care of fangs and claws. Particularly in the districts of North Market and Stoneyard, shifter children play hrazhak in the streets; this flamboyant sport involves making dramatic leaps and scaling walls.

The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is an infamous spot in North Market. It is dedicated to a crusading priest of the Silver Flame who uncovered a group of wererats in the early days of Sharn. Fathen was torn apart by the wererats he had exposed, and in his honor the Church of the Silver Flame raised the shrine on this site. It's said that any lycanthrope that enters the shrine will be forced into its true form. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame come from across Khorvaire to pray at the shrine, but the local shifter population has no love for the pilgrims or the church.

### Things to Do in Northedge

Northedge is the most peaceful quarter in Sharn. It does have a few taverns and temples, but if you're looking for excitement or a wide selection of goods and services, you'll want to go elsewhere. Even so, Northedge boasts some notable special attractions:

**Settle down**. If you're looking for a place to live in Sharn, Lower Northedge residences are of reasonable quality and price and offer more security than Lower Dura.

**Die in style**. The elves of Shae Lias are experts in funerary customs and embalming. In addition, the high priest of the Gates of Passage is capable of raising the dead.

**Find a patron**. Many eccentric nobles make their homes in Upper Northedge. A patron of the arts could take an interest in the career of a bard or an entertainer. A collector might keep capable adventurers on retainer with the understanding that they'll deliver any Dhakaani artifacts they come across in their travels. You never know what benefits a patron will provide; at the very least, having a patron can provide you with an introduction to high society.

## Tavick's Landing

Everyone who comes to Sharn, whether by land or air, passes through Tavick's Landing. The quarter took on a martial aspect during the Last War, and the tense atmosphere can still be felt today. On the positive side, Watch Commander Iyanna ir'Talan has gone to great efforts to purge corruption in the local garrisons of the Sharn Watch; as a result, this is one of the few districts where the Watch is both helpful and competent. On the downside, visitors from any nation that fought against Breland during the war might be greeted with suspicion or hostility.

![Tavick's Landing: Noteworthy Locations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/tavicks-landing-noteworthy-locations-erlw.md)

### Upper Tavick's Landing

This ward is effectively a self-contained city catering to the nobles that live there. It has fine housing, skilled services, a luxurious mercantile district, and even an entire district—Sunrise—designed for the servants of the nobles. The services and lodging in Sunrise accommodate those with poor or modest lifestyles, as opposed to the higher-priced goods found elsewhere in the ward.

For those willing to put up with its restrictive laws, Upper Tavick's Landing has many fine features. Wyredd's Spirits is the best source for wine in Sharn. The shop Crystals of Denion buys and sells rare magic items, though it only has a handful of such items at any given time. Transmutation is a renowned beauty salon providing both mundane and arcane services. House Deneith maintains a fortified garrison and training facility in the Copper Arch district.

#### The Laws of Upper Tavick's Landing

During the war, fears of attacks by foreign agents resulted in the establishment of a number of laws here that affect visitors, including adventurers, to this day.

The soldiers of House Deneith have full authority to act as agents of the Sharn Watch in Upper Tavick's Landing, and staff of Deneith's elite Blademark mercenaries maintain checkpoints at the district's edges.

You need a license to carry a weapon in Upper Tavick's Landing. It costs only 5 gp, but you have to plead your case to a clerk. Any Blademark or member of the watch can demand to see your license and might confiscate unauthorized weapons. You also need a license to cast spells in the ward. It costs 10 gp, and you must specify the spells you intend to cast. A fine can be levied for any unauthorized use of magic. To get licenses for weapons or spellcasting, you'll have to go to the courthouse in the Twelve Pillars district.

Another law requires inhabitants to dress "in a manner that upholds the solemn dignity of this proud ward." Blademarks and officers of the watch can choose how they interpret this. Typically, armor is considered inappropriate unless you're tied to House Deneith or the Sharn Watch, or you've served with the Brelish military. Anyone in contempt of this law is escorted out.

Any sort of unruly behavior—fighting, shouting in the streets, and the like—brings a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward.

### Middle Tavick's Landing

Unlike the upper ward, Middle Tavick's Landing welcomes travelers and tourists. The ward features a host of lively taverns and excellent inns. The Cornerstone is a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The Deathsgate district caters to adventurers, much as the Clifftop district of Upper Dura does. Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer's guild—though the Deathsgate Guild has a dark reputation, and its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers. (See the ""Adventurer's Guilds"" section for more information.) House Jorasco has a large house of healing in the ward, and House Deneith maintains a recruiting station for would-be mercenaries.

The Graystone district has deep roots in Karrnathi culture that predate the Last War; Slogar's and the Bloody Mug are places where homesick Karrns can enjoy blood sausage and Nightwood ale. The district is a haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the Blood of Vol can practice their faith.

Tavick's Market is one of Sharn's major market districts; located directly above the Terminus lightning rail station, it's filled with stands selling produce and goods brought in by local farmers.

![House Jorasco's House of H...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/101-3-06.webp#center "House Jorasco's House of Healing in Middle Tavick's Landing")

### Lower Tavick's Landing

Two land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick's Landing. The Orien lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann's Gate. Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls. Dragoneyes is also noteworthy for being the site of one of the few changeling communities in Breland.

House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick's Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well represented, with their representatives arranging matters of trade, transport, and security.

These days, Lower Tavick's Landing is best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a home for refugees from the Last War. High Walls is filled past capacity, mostly by Cyrans who were displaced by the Mourning. The gates are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any signs of unrest.

### Things to Do in Tavick's Landing

> [!readaloud] Voice of Breland—is your Neighbor a cyran invader?
> 
> In the wake of the Mourning, our king welcomed the survivors of that tragedy into our cities. In Sharn, High Walls alone holds more Cyran refugees than Karrnath has allowed across its borders. If you read the Sharn Inquisitive or the Korranberg Chronicle, you've heard the endless litany of how difficult life is, tales of overcrowding, starvation, and disease. Although we at the Voice of Breland sympathize with all who suffer, we refuse to ignore the deadly threat in our midst. The majority of Cyrans who survived the Mourning did so because they were beyond the borders of their nation. And why is that? Because they were soldiers.
> 
> The Sharn Inquisitive talks about starving children and ailing peasants, but it doesn't mention the Cyran special forces and elite war mages who now reside in High Walls. As Brelish, we all want to show compassion to the truly innocent, but let us never forget that these people were once our enemy and could be again. And let us also remember that the cause of the Mourning remains a mystery. Was it divine punishment for Cyran sins that have yet to be washed clean? Or could it have been a premature activation of an arcane weapon—and if so, could Cyran artificers already be working on an improved version in the heart of our greatest city?
> 
> Remain alert, people of Breland! Don't let the current plight of these unfortunates blind you to the danger!
^voice-of-brelandis-your-neighbor-a-cyran-invader

As a metropolitan district filled with immigrants, merchants, and travelers from across Khorvaire and beyond it, Tavick's Landing offers a host of opportunities to enjoy food and entertainment from distant lands. Or you might find yourself here for one of a few specific reasons, such as:

**Take a chance**. The Dragoneyes district is filled with ways to lose your wages, both in established gambling halls and on street corners. If you you're looking for something a little more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of the rumors are true, these are examples of what's possible at Chance.

**Find refuge**. Though most of the refugees in High Walls come from Cyre, the district is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish. The place is overcrowded, however, and resources are stretched thin. Tensions are high, and feuds and power struggles among the refugees take place regularly. If you're from Cyre, you might be able to find a cot in High Walls, especially if you already have friends or family living there.

**Bond over blood**. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is one of the few places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants are largely kept off the streets. But if you're a follower of the faith, it's a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or consult with a priest. It's also the best place to find a skilled necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of the Emerald Claw.

## Above and Below

The five main quarters of Sharn make up the bulk of the city. But a few additional districts lie above and below the metropolis proper, including wondrous sites and dangerous places that most folk prefer to avoid.

![Above and Below Sharn: Noteworthy Locations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/above-and-below-sharn-noteworthy-locations-erlw.md)

### Skyway

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/102-3-07.webp#center)

A number of floating towers drift above the upper wards of Sharn, but these are dwarfed by Skyway, an entire district suspended above and between Central Plateau and Menthis Plateau. Built on an island of solidified cloud, Skyway holds the mansions of the wealthiest people in Khorvaire—nobles whose feet never touch the ground. It's a realm of wonders, filled with the finest examples of luxury and extravagance that gold can buy and magic can produce. For instance, Cloudpool Park is formed from sculpted cloudstuff, with window panels of ice that provide a view of the city below.

Skyway is home to lavish estates. Prior to the Last War, noble families from across the Five Nations maintained mansions here. Though some of these places remain in the hands of their original owners, others were seized by the crown during the Last War and sold to wealthy citizens of Breland. The resulting influx of residents has brought more diversity to the district, with dragonmarked heirs and even wealthy criminals living alongside the nobility. The grandest estate in Skyway is Tain Manor, home of the ir'Tain family and the monthly Tain Gala (see ""Holidays"" earlier in this chapter).

This district offers the highest-priced services in the city. The Dragon's Hoard is a Ghallanda resort, where travelers can enjoy the utmost in luxury if they can afford the most expensive amenities. The Celestial Vista and the Cloud Dragon are wondrous restaurants. The Azure Gateway is a new hotel and restaurant that has replaced a Ghallanda establishment. The owner has remained anonymous, and this touch of mystery has piqued interest in the place.

If you're interested in mingling with nobles or celebrities, or if you want to pull off a heist that targets the richest people in Sharn, Skyway is the place to do that.

No bridges or lifts connect Skyway to the rest of the city, so the usual way to reach the floating district is by taking a skycoach or hiring a flying mount.

### Cliffside

Cliffside encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area's rough and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, "Better a tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine."

Plenty of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses meet different kinds of demands. These services include bordellos, taverns, gaming dens, and shadier entertainments for sailors to spend their off duty hours and wages on.

Even though the Sharn Watch has a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden districts in the city. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of sahuagin, who sell their services as guides to help ships traveling to Xen'drik. In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.

### The Cogs

The Cogs lie deep beneath Sharn, below the sewers and Old Sharn (described later in this chapter). Streams of Fernian lava flow through this area, and over the centuries, House Cannith has helped Breland establish vast foundries that tap this mystic resource. Ashblack and Blackbones are industrial districts, largely inhabited by warforged laborers and miserable workers of other races. It is said that House Cannith maintains a forgehold in the Ashblack district, and that this is where Baron Merrix d'Cannith conducts his experiments.

The Sharn Watch maintains a presence in the Cogs, and overseers from House Cannith are stationed here to keep things in order. Beyond these industrial districts lies the deeper tunnels of Khyber's Gate, a tenement district.

Blackbones has a number of remarkable locations. For example, the Pool of Onatar's Tears is sacred to the Sovereign of the Forge. The current caretaker is a warforged priest named Smith, who believes that Onatar has plans for the warforged, and that the warforged and creatures of flesh are meant to live together.

Most of the citizens of Sharn have never been to the Cogs. The area does house the bulk of the city's warforged population, and if you're looking for a particular warforged, it's the best place to start. Industrial espionage and labor struggles can add drama to adventures in the great foundries, not to mention the possibility of artificers with secret forges hidden in the Cogs.

## Dungeons of Sharn

Sharn boasts countless opportunities for adventurers. You can get caught up in espionage in Upper Central or drawn into a crime war in Lower Dura. Aside from the intrigues and politics of the city, Sharn has a wide range of cursed ruins, haunted slums, shunned catacombs, and other dangerous places. Wise folk avoid these areas, but those whose hunger for adventure outweighs their good sense might do the opposite.

### The City of the Dead

Look to the cliffs to the north of Sharn, and you'll see a collection of crypts embedded into the cliff face. This is the City of the Dead, the final resting place of the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Common folk are cremated after death, but members of the Sixty Families and others with sufficient wealth have their remains interred in the tombs and tunnels of this necropolis.

Few people reside in this area. Among its major features are Aureon's Holt, a temple of the Restful Watch, where Sovereign priests conduct funerals and serve as the caretakers of the tombs. Warden Tower is an outpost of the Church of the Silver Flame, staffed by a single hermit tasked to watch for supernatural threats.

Though the City of the Dead is largely peaceful, stories circulate about dark powers lurking there. Some parents warn their children of the Lich-Priest Gath, who steals disobedient children and forces them to work in his kingdom of the dead, polishing the bones of his skeletal subjects.

### Old Sharn

Sharn was built on the foundations of an older city, which was itself built atop goblin ruins. This old city was destroyed by dark magic, courtesy of the elemental powers of the infamous Halas Tarkanan and his consort, the Lady of the Plague. It is said that vile powers still linger in these ruins, and for this reason King Galifar I had all the passages to this undercity sealed with gates of metal and magic. These portals remain sealed today, and it's illegal to tamper with them. But it's generally assumed that many treasures are hidden in the ruins of Old Sharn, along with untold secrets of the past.

No one knows exactly what lurks in Old Sharn. The ruins could contain ghosts or other undead, the vengeful spirits of the aberrant-marked people who took refuge in the fallen city. In olden times, the Lady of the Plague had power over vermin and disease, and a fanciful tale says that even today the undercity is inhabited by swarms of sentient rats and beetles.

### Fallen

> [!readaloud] The Sharn Inquisitive—Dawn of disease
> 
> You'll hear warning bells toll tomorrow morning. You'll see packs of people with their faces hidden by plague masks or strips of cloth. Jorasco healers will roam the streets offering free examinations and blessings. If you're new to Sharn, have no fear! This isn't the outbreak of disease it appears to be; it's how Sharn observes the Lady's Day, commemorating a tragic incident in our past.
> 
> Today, aberrant dragonmarks are rare. But there was a time long ago when they were far more common. An army of aberrant heirs made their home here in the early days of Sharn, led by Halas Tarkanan—known as the Earthshaker—and the Lady of the Plague, who had power over vermin and disease. When the dragonmarked houses laid siege to the city and their defeat became inevitable, the two unleashed their full might. Tarkanan's power reduced the early towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of disease-infested vermin.
> 
> For centuries afterward, the region was shunned. When our modern city was built, the cursed ruins were sealed away. But one never knows when the darkness could rise up again. On the Lady's Day, we remember the tragedy that once befell Sharn, and we prepare for the possibility that it could happen again.
^the-sharn-inquisitivedawn-of-disease

The Fallen district in Lower Dura was once known as Godsgate. When the first towers were raised, Godsgate was the temple district. It had shrines and statues dedicated to the Sovereigns, a proud church of the Silver Flame, even a monument to the Undying Court. But as Sharn grew and prospered, religious services were moved to grander temples in the upper wards. Godsgate became a tenement district, and the shrines and monuments were forgotten and left to decay. The final blow to this once-proud district came early in the Last War. A team of Aundairian saboteurs brought down one of Sharn's floating towers, and the falling spire struck Godsgate. Buildings collapsed, and hundreds died. Untended corpses led to infection and disease. The City Council had no interest in sinking gold into Lower Dura to restore the area, and the district was abandoned.

Today, the district known as Fallen is strewn with the rubble of the fallen tower, mingled with shattered buildings and broken statues. Those who venture into Fallen must deal with the Ravers, feral savages that lurk in the shadows. There's no question that the Ravers exist, but their true nature remains a subject of debate. A common hypothesis is that they're the descendants of the original inhabitants of the district, who were possessed and driven mad by the ghosts of those who died when the tower fell. Others claim that House Vadalis has been trying to magebreed super-soldiers, and the Ravers are the result of failed experiments.

Only the most desperate people live here, and the forces of the law won't come near it. As a result, the district has a lot of space available for any cult or secret society that needs a lair. The followers of a radiant idol, the Cult of the Dragon Below, or any other cabal could lay claim to a shattered church in Fallen.

### Khyber's Gate

Beyond the Cogs lies Khyber's Gate, a maze of tunnels and tenements carved into the stone. The Sharn Watch has no presence here, and the closest thing to an authority is the criminal organization known as Daask; if you're seeking the leaders of this group, this is where you'll find them. Many of the inhabitants of the Gate are goblins and immigrants from Droaam, but it's also home to fugitives, war criminals, and other unsavory types.

Khyber's Gate is part of the ruins of a goblin city that was abandoned thousands of years ago. No one knows how deep it goes. The monstrous inhabitants of the district have no love for treasure hunters or adventurers, and it's a dangerous place to explore.

Shamukaar is the most successful tavern in Khyber's Gate. The place is a safe haven for all within it, regardless of species or politics; once you make it through the door, you can breathe easy.

### The Sewers

The upper wards of Sharn use a network of chutes to funnel garbage down into the sewers. Refuse and filth is channeled into cavernous midden chambers, where it is left to rot or be devoured by the vermin and oozes that inhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater into purification centers, where magewrights use magic to cleanse the water. A special unit of the Sharn Watch protects the purification chambers. Beyond these small, vital areas, the sewers are lawless.

Though the sewers were never intended to support a population, over the centuries a subculture has evolved in this region. A few tribes of people—mostly goblins, along with a few shifters, dwarves, and feral halflings—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden heaps and selling their goods in the lower city. These sewer clans constantly battle over territory, as control of one or more midden chamber can be critical to survival. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers, but they can also be valuable allies; there are no better guides to the sewers and what lies beneath them than one of the folk who live there.

## Criminal Activities

Under the laws of Sharn, crime takes many forms. Any sort of theft is illegal, including "malicious theft of identity"—the use of shapeshifting abilities or illusion magic to impersonate someone with the intent to cause harm. Assault, murder, and fraud will all land you in hot water. Other activities walk the edge of legality. Gambling and prostitution are legal in Sharn, but these industries are heavily taxed and regulated. Likewise, smuggled goods include illegal merchandise such as drugs and mystical explosives, but also heavily taxed goods, such as the drug known as dreamlily (described in "chapter 4").

Although crime occurs throughout Sharn, it is most apparent in Lower Dura and the Cogs. The Sharn Watch has a minimal presence in these wards, which are the easiest places to sell stolen goods or to hire an assassin. Of course, they're also good places to get robbed or caught up in a street brawl.

Sharn is home to a large number of minor gangs and independent criminals. Even so, most criminal activities in the city come under the purview of one of four criminal organizations: the Boromar Clan, Daask, House Tarkanan, and the Tyrants. Even independents usually have an arrangement with one of these power groups. If your character has the criminal background, work with the DM to determine which of these organizations you're connected to (the DM has more information about these groups in "chapter 4").

### The Boromar Clan

The Boromar Clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Today the Boromars are one of Sharn's most influential families; there's a Boromar on the City Council. Also, the Boromars have close ties by marriage to the local branch of House Jorasco, and clan members can be seen at every Skyway gala.

The Boromar Clan specializes in gambling, theft, and smuggling. In addition, it governs a wide network of lesser gangs and crime lords across the city. In the past, the clan's reputation was sufficiently strong to prevent any challenges. Over the last decade, however, the Boromars have been fending off a serious challenge from Daask. Those monsters have been aggressively targeting Boromar agents and holdings, and the feud between the two forces grows more heated all the time.

Having a connection to the Boromar Clan makes you part of the established power in Sharn. It's an organization that values tradition and prefers to avoid violence. As an associate of the clan, you'll be expected to respect the hierarchy and follow the rules, and you might be targeted by Daask just as if you were a Boromar yourself.

If you have a contact in the Boromar Clan, you might know someone on the Boromar Contacts table.

![The Boromar Clan; Boromar Contacts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-boromar-clan-boromar-contacts-erlw.md)

### Daask

Founded by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, the criminal organization known as Daask has been building its power for a decade and has recently begun an aggressive campaign of expansion. Daask engages mainly in violent crime, including armed robbery, assault, arson, and murder. As its reputation has grown, it has added extortion to this list.

If you have a contact in Daask, you might know someone on the Daask Contacts table.

![Daask Contacts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/daask-contacts-erlw.md)

### House Tarkanan

House Tarkanan is an elite force of mercenary thieves and assassins. The criminal talents of the Tarkanans are enhanced by another trait they share: every member of the house possesses an aberrant dragonmark. Thus, every Tarkanan has an unpredictable magical gift—and all of them are united by the fear and prejudice that most aberrant heirs elicit from other people.

If you have a contact in House Tarkanan, you might know someone on the Tarkanan Contacts table.

![House Tarkanan; Tarkanan Contacts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/house-tarkanan-tarkanan-contacts-erlw.md)

### The Tyrants

The Tyrants are forgers and grifters, specialists in deception and the acquisition of information. Most of the members are changelings, who use their shapeshifting abilities to fool marks and acquire secrets. There are magewrights among the Tyrants who can permanently alter your appearance. So, the Tyrants can steal someone's identity, but they can also provide a fugitive with a new life.

If you have a contact in the Tyrants, you might know someone on the Tyrants Contacts table.

![The Tyrants; Tyrants Contacts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/the-tyrants-tyrants-contacts-erlw.md)

## Forces of the Law

In Precarious, a dwarf tries to smuggle a portable hole filled with treasures pillaged from Xen'drik past the guards of the Sharn Watch.

In Clifftop, a patrol of guards calls on two dueling barbarians to throw down their weapons; the fierce warriors just snarl and rush at each other once more.

In the court of Upper Central, a magistrate orders the Justiciar of Aureon to blind the prisoner in preparation for his sentence of perpetual darkness.

The law is a force to be reckoned with in Sharn. Even in places where the watch is notoriously ineffective, those who would break the law still need to be wary of zealous guards resistant to bribes or threats.

### The Sharn Watch

The Sharn Watch is responsible for enforcing the laws of the city. The sentinels of the watch patrol the streets of Sharn, to all outward appearances vigilant for signs of unrest. In truth, the Sharn Watch is riddled with corruption, from the commanding officers down to the lowliest patrollers. Dedicated guards who truly want to protect the innocent do exist. But bribery nonetheless runs rampant, and the watch has a way of failing to show up somewhere at the same time that Daask or the Boromar Clan is perpetrating some misdeed. The DM can find more information on the watch in "chapter 4".

![An Artificer, with Two Eld...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/eberron-rising-from-the-last-war/img/103-3-08.webp#center "An Artificer, with Two Eldritch Cannons, Spies on a Member of the Sharn Watch")

### The King's Citadel

The members of the King's Citadel are the direct agents of the Brelish Crown. As such, the King's Citadel stands above the Sharn Watch. Its members have the authority to take control of any investigation and to command the service of any guard or sentinel. Typically the Citadel leaves the daily chores of law enforcement (including the conflicts between the criminal organizations of the lower towers) in the hands of the Sharn Watch. The Citadel is concerned with forces that threaten the entire city, or even the kingdom. Foreign spies, mad necromancers, and ancient fiends—these are the foes of the King's Citadel, rather than pickpockets and burglars.

Of course, many of these greater threats might be beyond the capabilities of the typical Citadel agents. Much as the Blackened Book does, the Citadel keeps a close eye on unusual and talented individuals, and a party of adventurers might be called upon to assist the Citadel in a dangerous mission.

Unlike the Sharn Watch, the Citadel doesn't ask for help: it demands it. The knights of the Citadel are the representatives of the King of Breland, and any Brelish citizen who refuses to help them is committing an act of treason. The Citadel isn't required to provide compensation for the services it demands, but an adventurer who wins the respect of the Citadel can certainly benefit from the relationship.

The Citadel is made up of these four divisions:

**The King's Dark Lanterns** gather intelligence and engage in covert operations.

**The King's Shields** protect the royal family and its closest associates.

**The King's Swords** are elite soldiers used in the most dangerous military operations.

**The King's Wands** are wizards and sorcerers, serving the crown in all arcane matters.

The headquarters of the Citadel is in the Ambassador Towers district of Middle Central, in Andith Tower. That structure also serves as the city jail.

### The Redcloak Battalion

The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are among the deadliest warriors in Sharn. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the Sharn Watch and the King's Citadel turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought in the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis today sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was assigned to Sharn. Its headquarters is located in the Daggerwatch district of Upper Dura.

Many of the members of the Redcloak Battalion resent being relegated to mere law enforcement, and there is a strong rivalry between the Redcloaks and the King's Swords of the Citadel, who generally have less military experience even though they enjoy far greater authority and prestige.

As veterans and heroes of the Last War, many of the Redcloaks are unfriendly toward travelers from other nations. As far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission, and soon King Boranel will come to his senses and finish the job that Wroann ir'Wynarn began.

### Crimes and Punishments

Officers of the watch can levy fines on the spot when they catch culprits, which is the typical way that minor crimes are dealt with. For a serious offense, the perpetrator is taken to a garrison and held until a trial can be arranged. A criminal who is considered to be a serious flight risk will be taken to the most secure facility in Sharn—the King's Citadel headquarters.

Typically, a prisoner's case comes to the attention of a local magistrate within `1d4` days. The magistrate reviews the facts of the case and asks the victim to confirm or deny their role in the crime while under the influence of a [zone of truth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell. The magistrate will then propose a punishment to the accused; if the offer is refused, the case goes to trial.

Punishment for convicted criminals varies, but long-term imprisonment is quite rare. Prisoners who deemed to be too dangerous to be allowed to roam free are more likely to be executed than imprisoned. Typically, a long prison sentence is used only for criminals who can't be allowed to go free, but whose deaths would have negative diplomatic repercussions.

Fines are the typical form of punishment. The amount of a fine is generally based on the nature of the crime, but a magistrate has the right to increase a fine to ensure that it is an effective punishment. For example, a fine of 10 gp is crippling to a commoner but can be inconsequential to an adventurer or a member of the Aurum, and in such cases it will be increased. Also, the court can confiscate possessions in lieu of receiving payments in gold; you might not care about having to pay a fine of 100 gp, but having your grandfather's magic sword confiscated instead might sting. If a criminal can't afford to pay a fine, the sentence might be changed to hard labor—or, in the case of adventurers, performing special services on behalf of the city or the Crown.

Other kinds of punishment include branding (generally in a visible location, warning others of your criminal actions), exile, or several magical measures: an ongoing curse, a period of induced blindness, and so on. A repeat offender might be declared an outlaw, which status is often indicated by a brand. An outlaw is stripped of the protection of the law, and anyone can take any action against them without fear of legal retribution.

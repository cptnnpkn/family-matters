# Chapter 3: Tal'Dorei Gazetteer
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, p. 64* 

![A colorful village lit at ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-splash.webp#center "A colorful village lit at night by soft, warm light. It lies within a swamp-like forest on a marshy waterfront with several ships ported, a mountain range can be seen in the background.")

> [!quote]- A quote from Norad Firth  
> 
> I've wandered over many a shore and plain in my journeys, and my mind still finds itself drawn back to Tal'Dorei. Ain't no place in this world more vibrant; the land feels young. Unscarred. Mind you, that sort of calm causes my old bones to itch, too. Folk in that land are kind and honest, and its vistas are second to none, yet...well, I'll just say that cities are cities, and the wilds are the wilds. Tal'Dorei's got plenty of both. Keep a sword or a wand with you wherever you go, adventurer.

This chapter contains a wealth of information about the lands of Tal'Dorei, the adventures to be found therein, and the many centers of civilization to be found across its vast wilds. Consider this chapter a compilation of a wide variety of assorted notes, research, and scattered publications of historians of the "Library of the Cobalt Soul" and the "Alabaster Lyceum".

Boundless possibilities await eager adventurers of all kinds who explore Tal'Dorei, from the vast fields of the "Dividing Plains" to the treacherous crags of Tal'Dorei's many mountains, from the storm-wracked "Lucidian Coast" to the immemorial depths of the "Rifenmist Jungle". Countless nomadic civilizations exist within these realms of magic and monsters, as do dozens of tiny villages, thriving towns, and bustling cities. The people of Tal'Dorei do what they can to survive, and share the tales of treasures and adventure with any who will listen.  Consider this gazetteer a compilation of tales and fragmented histories, passed down from bards and scholars. Your campaign can follow its descriptions to the letter, or diverge as wildly as you see fit.

## Settlements

Every permanent settlement in Tal'Dorei has a few basic statistics that impart a top-level impression of that place. This includes what type of settlement it is—typically a village, town, or city—its population, and its rough demographics. Don't feel restricted by these demographics if you want your character to come from a specific location but you don't see their race listed there. People of all races can be found in just about every community in Tal'Dorei, and your character can come from anywhere.

Additionally, cities and large towns often have a number of small rural communities outside their fortified walls and population center. The population numbers of these larger settlements include the people in the outlying areas. On the other hand, the official populations of a village or other small settlement just includes the people living in the village itself.

In fact, though there are a few villages and small settlements listed in this gazetteer, Tal'Dorei is home to hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny settlements too small to detail or place on the map. The Game Master can make up any number of villages or other communities wherever they wish in Tal'Dorei without changing any of the lore presented in this gazetteer. And of course, the GM can also create large settlements unique to their version of Tal'Dorei—the only difference is that they should be prepared to think about how their version of Tal'Dorei is different, now that they've added another hub of population, trade, politics, and culture.

## Story Hooks

This chapter contains a variety of story hooks that you can use as a starting point for Tal'Dorei adventures of your own creation. "Chapter 5" of this book contains advice for expanding these hooks into full adventures, and even more advice for creating RPG stories can be found in the fifth edition core rules.

These plot hooks are tied to specific locations, and all have a level range. These level recommendations aren't strictly mandated, but have generally been chosen either because of the monsters involved, because of the narrative weight of the location or characters involved, or to indicate how epic and world-affecting the adventure should be.

- For low-level characters: 1st to 4th level  
- For mid-level characters: 5th to 10th level  
- For high-level characters: 11th to 16th level  
- For epic-level characters: 17th to 20th level  

> [!note]
> For more information about adventure levels see Tiers of Play.

Additionally, some plot hooks are marked as "any level." These hooks present stories broad enough to suit characters of any level, anywhere in their party's story. These hooks generally don't suggest specific monsters to use as villains. When creating adventures based off of these hooks, use the encounter-building advice in the fifth edition core rules to choose appropriate foes for your players.

## Lucidian Coast

The stormy Lucidian Ocean crashes furiously against the rocky coasts of eastern Tal'Dorei, chewing inlets into the coastline and spurring vast banks of impenetrable fog across the waters. Most ships rightly avoid the volatile northern waters, instead docking at southern ports like "Stilben". Adventurous folk leave their seafaring vessels behind and brave the "Mooren River Run" to "Drynna". Yet even there, the Lucidian Coast is not without its dangers; vicious wildlife stalks the wilderness, and flocks of [harpies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) have harried the shores since time immemorial, drawing lost sailors to their doom upon the rocks.

### Drynna

- **Town.** Population 2,765 (75% "humans", 8% "gnomes", 8% "halflings", 4% "elves", 5% "other races")  

Along the shore of "Mooren Lake" rests the sleepy town of Drynna. The community thrives on the bountiful wildlife around the lake, and the Drynna fisherfolk are responsible for most of eastern Tal'Dorei's freshwater fish supply. The social guidance of the city revolves around the Sunrise Lodge (or simply "the Lodge"), a membership of community leaders who meet to discuss and vote on important social and legal matters. The Lodge has also sent a variety of increasingly frustrated petitions to the "Tal'Dorei Council", since their community's small size means they have traditionally lacked a delegate of their own on the council. However, the recent surge in prospectors has increased their population enough for a member of the Lodge to attend council sessions, and the Lodge is doing everything it can to make sure the boom lasts as long as possible before it falls into bust.

#### Boomtown

"Drynna" has a small militia to protect the town from wild beasts and roving monsters, and to capture horse thieves and other petty criminals. This militia is presently overwhelmed by hundreds of prospectors who have swept into town over the past three years after hearing rumors that chunks of [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) have been found in "Mooren Lake", washed down the river from the "Alabaster Sierras".

Given the high price of [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md), this new occurrence has made "Drynna" into something of a boomtown. Thousands of small homesteads now surround the town center, and burglary and banditry are both on the rise.

#### Drynna Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Drynna" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Unfriendly Waters (mid-level)

Recently, "Drynna" has suffered a number of losses, with prospectors and fisherfolk being attacked. Worse still, the supply of fish itself seems to be declining rapidly; without this local food staple, villages across eastern Tal'Dorei will certainly starve. The party hears the call for mercenaries reaching as far as "Westruun" and "Stilben". The culprit is a [hydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md) within the lake that has gained intelligence by living for so long in the [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md)-infused waters. It has an Intelligence score of 12 (+1), can speak Common, and commands a tribe of [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md).

> [!note]
> Use the [Drynna Hydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/drynna-hydra-tdcsr.md) statblock for this adventure.

##### Bleak Inheritance (any level)

Last year, Hareth Val Bardo, a younger member of the Sunrise Lodge, made a pact with the Moon Mistress (see ""Mooren Lake"," below). Hareth's elder brother, Pauvren, died in his sleep shortly thereafter, leaving the entire Val Bardo family fortune to Hareth, the only surviving heir. However, nightmares now haunt Hareth every night, and violent urges surge through his mind. The Lodge, having noticed Hareth's paranoid eyes and twitchy hands, calls upon outsiders to investigate.

### K'Tawl Swamp

The sprawling swamplands of "K'Tawl" cover much of the southern "Lucidian Coast", enveloping "Stilben" and the K'Tawl Bay. The saltwater swamp is thick with cypress and tupelo trees reaching up from muddy waters that range, in places, from one to ten feet deep—or more. The hot, muggy air and thick, sludge-covered landscape host all manner of terrible beasts, including venomous [flying snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/flying-snake.md) and man-eating [giant frogs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-frog.md).

Bands of frog-headed humanoids harry the edges of "Stilben" from their deep-marsh encampments, while a vicious school of [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) called the Ghormauth command the shoreline of "K'Tawl". The bloodthirsty "Ravagers" use the forested edges of the swamp to ambush prey—as do countless bandits and petty thieves. As such, caravans and messengers must remain on constant alert for the possibility of an ambush. With such dangers lurking in the swamp, travel to and from "Stilben" is rarely made without an armed escort.

#### K'Tawl Swamp Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "K'Tawl Swamp" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### They Shamble (mid-level)

People have been disappearing from the isolated swamp-burghs within the "K'Tawl". The characters, perhaps en route to "Stilben", spend the night in the village of Dunghill. After hearing tales of the disappearances, the characters awaken the next morning to screams—as a terrified human is carried off within the rotting orifice of a [shambling mound](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) of swamp vegetation.

##### Monolith of the Hells (high-level)

Why have members of the Torchraiser herd been found dead, their hearts exploded and their teeth plucked from their mouths? Why have the stagnant "K'Tawl" waters suddenly begun to flow toward the dismal center of the swamp? A divine messenger of the Everlight visits the characters, its celestial form torn and wavering, and dies before it can impart its request. On the angel's lips is a single dying phrase: "Destroy K'Tawl's Heart."

### Mooren Lake

North of the "Summit Peaks" is a shimmering lake fed by the snowmelt from the "Alabaster Sierras" by the "Mooren River Run". "Mooren Lake" is surrounded both by bountiful wildlife and the frightful creatures attracted to such a thriving ecosystem, including roving [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md), flocks of [harpies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md), and several [hyrdas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md)—> [!note]
> including the [Drynna Hydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/drynna-hydra-tdcsr.md)—that lurk in the lake's depths.

Centuries of [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) runoff from the "Alabaster Sierras" have allowed deposits of [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) to collect at the bottom of the lake—and the [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) has formed into a thrumming organ of raw magical energy, beginning to gain sentience. The twin islands in the center of the lake are blanketed by an ever-present mist, and folk tales tell of a beautiful, ageless woman, known only as the Moon Mistress, who watches over the island shores. It's said that any mortal who seeks an audience is judged by her, and is either granted a favor, a boon of unveiled knowledge, or a swift and terrible end.

#### Mooren Lake Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Mooren Lake" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Renew the Mists (mid-level)

The Moon Mistress, a [night hag](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) who takes the guise of a water nymph, uses the fading mists to shroud her location from a blood hunter named Perron Brill, a woman dedicated to hunting the Mistress down out of vengeance. The mists require a blasphemous mortal sacrifice to renew, and the Mistress is willing to reward those who would aid her in retrieving a victim—willing or otherwise. Perron Brill resides in nearby "Drynna", and though she is no saint herself, more honorable characters may think it best to help the hunter find her prey in "Rootgarden Marsh".

### Rootgarden Marsh

The shallows of "Mooren Lake" leak into the tender soil of the lake-bed and spread eastward, creating the cold and desolate "Rootgarden Marsh". Tall, thin trees lift five or more feet above the muck upon stilt-like roots, like freshwater mangroves. Their sparse placement gives them the appearance of a village of scattered huts. The fresh water mingles with salt here, leaving only adapted vegetation. The smell of moss and rot fills the air, while strange, feral creatures leap from tree to tree, or patiently wait from within their dome-like tree-root dens to snatch wary travelers. An organized group of gnoll marauders called the Moonsteeth keep their cavern hideout here, striking out at easy targets outside of "Drynna" and "Mooren Lake".

Since the region is populated almost entirely by monsters, most humanoids avoid it whenever possible. Those few who explore the deadly marsh do so only out of necessity, either because they need to unlock Rootgarden's many secrets, or because "civilization" is even more dangerous to them than the primal dangers found within.

#### Rootgarden Marsh Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Rootgarden Marsh" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### The Ley-Knot (mid-level)

Without warning, arcane magic stops functioning within a hundred-mile radius of "Rootgarden Marsh". As panic spreads across northeastern Tal'Dorei, the characters or a patron of theirs discover that a major ley line, the source of arcane power in this part of the world, has been twisted and tied into a knot at the center of the marsh. This knot has been tied by High Moonspeaker Luneskon of the Moonsteeth "gnolls". Her ambitions are small, but whatever method she used to tangle the ley lines must be erased from history—knowledge of its existence could bring disaster to all of Tal'Dorei.

##### Death's Garden (any level)

Rootgarden's strange ecology has produced many distinctive and powerful forms of plant life. During the course of a campaign, a group of adventurers may need to create a unique potion requiring the essence of manawort, a sentient mushroom found only within Rootgarden. The manawort mushroom is fearful of being harvested, and has made close friends with a black dragon named Thardraxxus, who keeps the mushroom and its sporelings safe. This dragon can be of any age, depending on what level the characters are.

### Stilben

- **Large Town.** Population 10,660 (67% "humans", 11% "elves", 11% "halflings", 5% "half-elves", 6% "other races")  

Stilben stinks to high heaven. Most sailors who pass through it—be they honest traders of the Clovis Concord in "Wildemount" or pirates seeking their next conquest—call this dismal burgh the Rotted Lot. The stink and the crime that run through this town make the name an apt one, but things aren't all bad in Stilben. The largest port on this coast of Tal'Dorei, Stilben is the focal point of international trade with "Wildemount". Even though Stilben's permanent population is a scant ten thousand, its more transient population of sailors who stay for a few days or weeks at a time is just as large, and fully triples Stilben's total population in the summer months.

Predictably, the vast majority of Stilben's business caters to folk who won't stay for long. There are brothels aplenty, at least one inn and one tavern each on every street, and countless other comforts for the weary traveler. The town is nestled in the sticky depths of the "K'Tawl Swamp", and its putrescent stink mingles with the humidity and the ever-present buzz of insects to produce an air of misery around Stilben's outer districts. Pushed out of Stilben's cozy, cosmopolitan heart, its poor and disenfranchised citizens—derisively called muckdwellers by the town's bigshots—struggle to eke out a living in the "K'Tawl's" murky waters.

Central Stilben houses most of its businesses, residences, and attractions. Those living in Stilben's heart like to present a clean, "civilized" view of their town, maintaining it as a thriving commercial hub. The cross-continental "Silvercut Roadway" leads from Stilben all the way to "Emon", and its robust trade of rare goods, textiles, and spices has given rise to a formidable merchant ruling class. Though the aging Margrave Wendle Truss is Stilben's ruler in name, it is the guilds that hold true power. Their vast wealth and sizeable "protection" force have impelled the bombastic-yet-ineffectual margrave to acquiesce to the guilds' will in order to maintain peace, as well as to preserve his own station within the city.

Order is kept by the Waterwatch, Stilben's official constabulary, but corruption is common within their ranks. The past few decades have been hard for the "Clasp" in Stilben. Though the local Spireling has kept a tight grip on the margrave and the Waterwatch, the "Myriad" has used bribes, intimidation, and every dirty trick in the book to winnow away the "Clasp's" power. Now, Stilben is little more than a crucible for the power struggle between the two criminal organizations.

> [!note] Origins of Vox Machina
> 
> The citizens of "Stilben" do not know that some of Exandria's greatest heroes, Vox Machina, first met in their humble city and went on their first adventure in the muck of the "K'Tawl Swamp". Back then, even the exalted Vox Machina were just two-copper adventurers, quickly forgotten by "Stilben's" haughty elite. One dwarf named Heinrich Runescribe, a junior member of the "Alabaster Lyceum's" revered Lorekeeper Society, practically worships the heroes that defeated the "Chroma Conclave", and has made it his mission to record all of their travels. He has found a wealth of evidence that the heroes of Vox Machina first gathered in "Stilben" under inauspicious circumstances and were dragged into an unexpected battle against the "Myriad".

#### Stilben Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Stilben" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Lost Below (low-level)

A "Stilben" guild known as the Relic Seekers partnered with the "Clasp" to smuggle a hoard of stolen "Syngornian" artifacts through the heart of the "K'Tawl Swamp" to the port of "Stilben". The smugglers were last seen by a "Clasp" agent watching a bridge in the western swamp, but two weeks have passed since their last contact. They should have arrived by now. The characters are approached by one of several groups: an agent of the Relic Seekers in search of the relics, one of the "Clasp" seeking to find their smugglers, or a "Myriad" taskmaster who seeks to undermine the "Clasp". Their first contact: the bridge guard, a hulking tiefling [Clasp enforcer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/clasp-enforcer-tdcsr.md) named L'Arkhelle.

##### Ashari Agitator (mid-level)

Gang warfare between the "Clasp" and the "Myriad" has been a daily affair in "Stilben" for the past thirty years, but something is changing. A cruel [Ashari waverider](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ashari-waverider-tdcsr.md) named Galessi has joined the "Myriad" and is using her elemental magic to turn the tide of this gang war. The "Clasp", the Waterwatch, and even the Air Ashari of "Zephrah" want to see Galessi laid low, but she has a secret base within the swamp, protected by a [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) [giant crocodile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md) and putrid [water elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md).

##### Demonblood Vengeance (high-level)

A [marilith](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md) demon using the guise of a blonde human named Iselda has been lurking on the outskirts of "Stilben" since her defeat at the hands of Vox Machina decades ago. Her demonic ichor has spawned a brood of [demonfeed spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/demonfeed-spider-tdcsr.md) that now view her as their mother. Iselda, sensing an opportunity, dedicated herself to the Spider Queen and attracted a small legion of dark elf fanatics to her side. Aided by all these evil creatures, she plans on conquering "Stilben", not for the "Myriad", but for herself and her evil god.

### Summit Peaks

The Summit Peaks loom over the southeastern plains of Tal'Dorei, like great spires of rock reaching for the sky. The tall, thin mountains burst so aggressively from the surrounding fields and swampland that even travelers from distant lands recognize them as a landmark of eastern Tal'Dorei. They are a welcome sight for any ship's crew making their way to shore. The mountain valleys recess into marshy gorges that house all manner of creatures migrating from the "K'Tawl". Reclusive [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) and [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) also make their homes in the marshy valleys. As the mountains rise higher, strong winds blow across the battered rock, leaving strangely smooth peaks that harbor [griffon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) lairs, [harpy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) dens, and convocations of [giant eagles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md) hunting the lower lands.

![The landscape of Zephrah: ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-zephrahsplash.webp#center "The landscape of Zephrah: A village among the clouds on grassy, spiralling mountain peaks. There is a tall, purple leafed tree in the foreground with the druid Keyleth and her mother Vilya holding staffs, conversing underneath it as they look at the village. Two individuals on skysails fly overhead.")

### Zephrah

- **Small Town.** Population 1,310 (62% "half-elves", 12% "elemental ancestry", 10% "humans", 9% "halflings", 5% "tieflings", 2% "other races")  

High atop a mountain aerie within the "Summit Peaks" sits Zephrah, the tribal home of the Air Ashari people, keeping vigil over a gate into the Elemental Plane of Air. "The Ashari" people worship and live by the balance of the natural world, and the people of Zephrah have adapted to life among the clouds. Most of the tribe consists of skilled hunters and climbers who hunt [mountain goats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mountain-goat-idrotf.md), large birds, and other cliff-dwelling creatures, along with subsisting on high-elevation vegetation. Utilizing the proximity of powerful elemental magic, the druidic masters of the Air Ashari craft [skysails](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skysail-tdcsr.md) to ride the ever-present winds, allowing their people to traverse the sheer cliffs of the mountains. The leader of Zephrah is called the Voice of the Tempest; they oversee all travel through the rift, all major druidic rituals, and any visiting outsiders.

Though it's still a small settlement, Zephrah has grown greatly in the past several years. Many people with an innate connection to the element of air have petitioned the current [Voice of the Tempest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) for her permission to live here among "the Ashari". Likewise, a number of [druids](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) and other spellcasters who wish to learn the ways of the Air Ashari have come to live in relative isolation here—after they have proven their good intentions and respect for the sanctity of the skies.

#### Diplomacy and Developments

"Zephrah" has grown in more than just population. The close friendship shared between [Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md), and the genius inventor [Percival de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) of "Whitestone" has led to a number of modern technologies being adopted in "Zephrah". Windmills now dot the cliffsides, milling grain purchased from farms on the "Dividing Plains". [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) continues to work with [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) to improve the lives of her people through technology and innovation. The operation of two of these mills is also kept private from the rest of "Zephrah", and they're used to refine [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) into [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) for the construction of magic items to arm the [Ashari skydancers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ashari-skydancer-tdcsr.md).

[Keyleth's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) confident leadership has also guided her to make further diplomatic ties between her people and the rest of Tal'Dorei. These attempts at breaking down the traditional isolationism of "the Ashari" have been met with skepticism from within, slowing the process to a crawl. Allowing any outsiders into "Zephrah" at all has been seen as a huge step. Beyond this, [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) has pushed for greater economic and political involvement, so that the needs of "Zephrah" can be heard in the "Tal'Dorei Council". Resistance toward political integration has mostly been internal within "the Ashari", but [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) considers any progress at all a good start.

#### Defense

"Zephrah" has never maintained a formal army, though past Voices of the Tempest have trained martial forces and druidic warriors to defend their home against the monsters of the "Summit Peaks". As [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) attempts to build bonds between her people and the rest of Tal'Dorei, she has expanded the training of new [skydancers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ashari-skydancer-tdcsr.md) and created a unit of druidic warriors capable of responding to any emergency across Tal'Dorei. If a threat like the "Chroma Conclave" were to rise again in Tal'Dorei, the [skydancers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ashari-skydancer-tdcsr.md) of "Zephrah" would be there to help save the nation's people.

Thanks to "Zephrah's" mountainous terrain, "the Ashari" enclave has never fallen under siege. Because of the dangerous beasts that lurk in the mountains, most Zephran adults have learned how to wield a [spear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spear.md) or a [staff](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff.md) to defend themselves. Roughly one-in-ten people have undergone a small amount of elemental training—enough to be able to cast the [gust of wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell a number of times per day equal to their Wisdom modifier (minimum of once).

Were "Zephrah" to fall under attack, the [skydancers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ashari-skydancer-tdcsr.md) would defend the town and its elemental rift for as long as possible while the rest of its people evacuated to hidden retreats in the mountain caves.

#### Zephrah Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Zephrah" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Poached Eggs (low-level)

The local Ashari have noticed a terrible trend of poachers climbing the peaks to steal entire [griffon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) nests full of eggs, leaving the parents slain. The efficiency, brutality, and growing rate of these attacks suggest the hunters are dangerous professionals, and "the Ashari" are seeking aid in finding and punishing those responsible before the locally endangered creatures are all dead or taken. The culprits, human poachers (use [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) statistics) led by a [quasit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) demon named Ryzzix, are fencing the stolen eggs on the "Stilben" black market.

##### A Welcome Overstayed (mid-level)

Shaktia, an overbearing [djinni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) soldier from the Plane of Air, has recently discovered and come through the elemental rift into "Zephrah". However, the [djinni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) refuses to leave, instead choosing to bother the people with pranks, debates, and invitations to become his well-paid servants. The [Voice of the Tempest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md), at the end of her patience, seeks adventurers to capture Shaktia and return him through the rift to the Elemental Plane of Air. However, when the adventurers learn what caused the [djinni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) to leave his home plane in the first place, they may find it hard to force him to leave.

## Alabaster Sierras

In the northeastern reaches of the continent, where the waters of the "Lucidian Ocean" break between the rocky shores of Tal'Dorei, a lush treeline fills the valleys between the chalk-white bluffs of the Alabaster Sierras. This gelid northern territory has for decades been beyond the reach of the "Tal'Dorei Council", and fallen under the rule of the "Chamber of Whitestone". However, over twenty years ago, thousands of "Emonian" refugees fled to Whitestone to ride out the devastation of the "Chroma Conclave". These refugees included the bereaved family of the Last Sovereign. Since those dark days, the "Chamber of Whitestone" has enjoyed a close relationship with the "Tal'Dorei Council". Lady [Vex'ahlia de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md), a member of the "Chamber of Whitestone", also sits on the "Tal'Dorei Council" itself, further strengthening the bonds of unity between this once-isolated land and the rest of the realm.

Beyond "Whitestone", the region's vibrant-yet-gothic urban center, the Alabaster Sierras are framed by dangerously windy shoreside cliffs and dry, desolate mountains swarming with [harpies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md), cold-adapted [wyverns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md), and other hungry monstrosities. Beneath the peaks, the valley opens into the thickly wooded pine forest known as the "Parchwood". This dense, temperate rainforest is beautiful and lush, but many shadowed threats loom in the dark of the wood.

The northern center of the valley marks a single clearing, where the humble city of "Whitestone" stands as the source of rule and law in this land. The people here have been hardened through strife and exalted through freedom, enough to know honor and appreciate loyalty like few other civilizations do.

### Mooren River Run

While many smaller streams and rivers run through the "Parchwood Timberland", gathering rain and snow runoff from the nearby mountains, they nearly all empty into the massive Mooren River Run. A powerful river that tears through the heavy forests of the "Alabaster Sierras", the Mooren River Run flows fiercely southward, out of the woods and into "Mooren Lake", near the "Lucidian Coast". Freshwater fish are in ready supply along the river's path, and "Whitestone" maintains a well-guarded dock for their fishermen to feed their people.

The small town surrounding the dock is simply called Mooren, and seasonally is home to some five thousand people of various ancestries in the spring and summer. When conditions grow too cold, mages from "Whitestone" are called to place [arcane locks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md) upon all establishments and to place the empty town in lockdown until next season.

Due to the plentiful nature of the river, many denizens of the "Parchwood" wander its banks to reap its bounty, or to seek bounty from those who frequent it.

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Mooren River Run" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Bear of the White River (low-level)

While traveling near "Whitestone" or through the "Parchwood Timberland", the characters find the corpse of half-orc forester; a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that he was savaged by a large bear. This half-orc's forester clothing marks her as a cleric of the Stormlord and a member of the "Rivermaw herd", a long way from the "Dividing Plains". Investigating the scene shows that bear tracks in the mud lead westward, toward the "Mooren River Run". These tracks, when followed, soon fade into the bare footprints of a humanoid—the killer was a [werebear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/werebear.md), but who could it be?

##### Off-Season Suspicion (mid-level)

The cold nights of autumn and winter force even the most stalwart fisherfolk away from Mooren. Some Mooren residents who have returned to "Whitestone" for the off-season have seen lights in the abandoned town, and are spreading rumors that some of the mages contracted to "lock up" after everyone has left town are actually agents of the "Myriad". The truth is that these mages are mercenaries hired by the "League of Miracles" to secretly conduct experiments on [cold snap spirits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cold-snap-spirit-tdcsr.md) to transform them into loyal elemental warriors.

### Parchwood Timberlands

Dark, dense, and often assailed by snow and cold winds, the Parchwood Timberlands consume most of the valleys within the "Alabaster Sierras" with pine trees and heavily overgrown pathways. The grim and forbidding interior of the Parchwood is home to many grim inhabitants, from the spectral remains of unlucky travelers past to wandering blights spawned by corrupt trees that consume the life around them. Howls can be heard in the darkest of nights, giving rumor to [werewolf](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf.md) hunting parties that stalk the wood. A handful of nearby farmers swear they've encountered a community of territorial "centaurs" in the southern region of the Parchwood, though such tales are largely met with derision. It's common knowledge that if you intend to travel through the thick fog of the Parchwood Timberlands, you stick to the roads, you bring some muscle, and you pray to whatever gods bring you comfort.

#### Parchwood Timberlands Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Parchwood Timberlands" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Headless Horse-Man (mid-level)

The "centaurs" of the "Parchwood" are no myth, and many are succumbing to a curse of undeath. One among them, a headless stallion-lord named Ichabarr, now leads the Herd of the Damned across the valleys of the "Parchwood". Several small settlements outside "Whitestone" have told the "Chamber" that these skeletal monsters have been spiriting away eligible young bachelors, and soon no men will be left in the Timberlands. These marauders are [centaur skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/centaur-skeleton-tdcsr.md). Their leader Ichabarr uses the same statistics, and can also use the optional Spirit Away feature.

##### They Seek Only Rest (high-level)

Those who travel the "Parchwood" sometimes hear thunder roll through the valley, accompanied by the cracking of timbers, but no storm follows. Over twenty years ago, the "Briarwoods" slaughtered and reanimated an entire clan of giants native to the "Parchwood". Some of these zombie giants survived the fall of the "Briarwoods". Most of these giants have been destroyed by the "Grey Hunters", but a few still remain. However, their mindless actions are not without purpose: each giant is tormented by being denied the halls of their ancestors, and quietly weeps for their lost afterlife as they roam.

Zombie giants can be represented by changing any giant's type to undead, decreasing its AC to 8, giving it resistance to bludgeoning damage from nonmagical attacks, and giving it immunity to poison damage and the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition. This does not affect its challenge rating.

### Salted Bluffs

The tumultuous waters of the "Lucidian Ocean" that encompass the northeast edge of Tal'Dorei end at the towering seaside cliffs called the Salted Bluffs. These cliffs mark the coastal boundary of the "Alabaster Sierras" and are home to seemingly infinite cliffside caverns that overlook the ocean, sometimes hundreds of feet up. The waters along the base are rocky and dangerous to traverse by boat, and only the most skilled of captains even consider sailing through these treacherous waters. These factors make the Salted Bluffs an ideal hideaway for pirates, who have taken to these bluffs to hide away their riches or build a base of operations.

However, these outlaws must also deal with the colonies of [harpies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) native to the region. They can never be too sure if a cave they're holing up in for the evening is abandoned—or if it's home to a beast of alluring song and shredding talons. Even empty caves house the remains of these [harpies'](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) brutal kills, for they sweep up unsuspecting creatures and dash them against the cliffs and rocks, recovering the broken corpses to feed upon safely.

#### Salted Bluffs Adventures

##### Crow's Nest (low-level)

The Ashwing [harpy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) tribe that roost among the Salted Bluffs have recently commandeered the [galley](/3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/galley.md) owned by the group of penitent corsairs and started raiding coastal villages. They are led by Captain Silvercomb, an arrogant, dashing, and well-spoken [harpy grandmother](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy-matriarch-gos.md). The other [harpies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) are just pillaging for fun, but Silvercomb seems to be searching for something, and she always wears a pendant with a black feather around her neck. What could it be?

##### Start Believing in Ghost Stories (low-level)

Pirates are one thing. Undead pirates are another. A group of [swashbucklers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/swashbuckler-mpmm.md) have willingly turned themselves in to the "Chamber of Whitestone", begging for absolution from the Dawnfather for their crimes. They refuse to return to the cove where they kept their stolen treasure since it's guarded by the [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) and [skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) of their risen comrades—as well as the [wight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight.md) that killed them. Perhaps a group of adventurers can save the day?

### Shearing Channel

Long ago, a land bridge once connected the landmasses of Tal'Dorei and "Wildemount". However, the catastrophic forces of the "Calamity" blasted it apart, leaving in its place a deathly strait of jagged rock and gale-force winds. Numerous ships have been ruined against the tides of the channel, and sea creatures that thrive on wreckage have taken up residence beneath the waters. It's said that no honest sailor knows a safe passage through the channel, but rumors abound of hidden coves and unknown routes that the Revelry pirates of "Wildemount's" Menagerie Coast use to safely traverse these deadly waters.

#### Shearing Channel Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Shearing Channel" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Scion of Oblivion (epic-level)

The Chained Oblivion has no physical form, but some residue of its power was cast into the ocean when the Dawnfather pursued it from the "Alabaster Sierras" to "Gatshadow". This seed of evil has had eons to gestate undisturbed in the tempestuous channel—and now it rises. A [kraken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md), mutated by the Oblivion's aberrant power, explodes from the water. Its mere presence causes the flesh and minds of sailors to fuse to their ships, sea creatures to hideously mutate into humanoid abominations, and the clouds above to rain thick, ichorous black droplets. A storm now lingers permanently over the "Shearing Channel", and forces from "Whitestone" and the Menagerie Coast of western "Wildemount" relay frantic messages, seeking to somehow halt this evil. It seems to be building an army here for some larger attack. What is it planning?

### Whitestone

- **Small City.** Population 17,710 (78% "humans", 7% "halflings", 6% "dwarves", 4% "tieflings", 5% "other races")  

Over two hundred years ago, the de Rolo family helmed an expedition from "Wildemount" to the shores of Tal'Dorei. When their vessel wrecked upon the stones of the "Shearing Channel", the de Rolos and their remaining crew survived for weeks in the "Alabaster Sierras", despite the tempestuous weather and slavering beasts. After a time, the survivors found a clearing containing a single tree that glowed with the radiance of the sun itself. They called it the "Sun Tree"—a literal blessing of the Dawnfather himself—and built their home around it.

Since then, the de Rolos' pioneering settlement has grown into a robust, if isolated, city. The sights of the city range from the gothic majesty of "Castle Whitestone" to the radiant glory of the "Sun Tree", and from the quaint townhouses of the city center to the humble homesteads of its outlying townships. Because Whitestone is limited in fertile farmland, locally grown produce is scarce, leading to the necessity to develop a good trade relationship with the rural communities of the "Turst Fields".

Though the region's scarcity of vital resources made for a harrowing first few years, the de Rolo family stumbled upon a miraculous mineral they called [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md). This geological marvel both gave their city its name and quickly became its most important and most sought-after export. Before long, the de Rolos' sale of [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) allowed them to quickly amass a significant fortune and construct a princely keep within their city.

The city is constantly improved (and unsettled) by the brilliant tinkering of [Percival de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md). His greatest creation, the "Heart of Whitestone", overlooks the city. Most prominent these days, however, is a rudimentary electric light grid. Using acid pits in the relatively unexplored caverns beneath the city as a sort of battery, six dozen electric lamps throughout the city are given just enough power to gently illuminate the streets, the watch posts on the castle, and the city walls with a soft, greenish glow all through the night.

#### Scars of the Briarwoods

Lady Delilah and Lord Sylas Briarwood, former cult leaders of The Whispered One, were ousted from "Whitestone" over twenty years ago. Though they are no more, the evil they committed still lingers. The nearly six years they ruled "Whitestone" sapped life and hope from its people. Though homes have been rebuilt and the Briarwoods' undead monstrosities have been eradicated, the trauma of the vampires' reign of terror will linger for generations. Some people of "Whitestone" were so deeply affected that they turned to necromancy and vampirism themselves, and have fled into the "Alabaster Sierras" to learn the secrets of the Briarwoods' foul magic—and to emulate their takeover of "Whitestone". The enigmatic "Grey Hunters", the secretive elite warriors of the "Chamber of Whitestone", have worked tirelessly to pull out the "Remnants" by their roots, but permanently eliminating them seems an impossible task.

#### An Enchanting Export

One of the climactic battles of the "Calamity" was a clash between the stalwart Dawnfather and the engine of callous destruction known as the Chained Oblivion. This battle came to a dramatic and explosive conclusion in the "Alabaster Sierras". The unstable arcane forces unleashed in their battle created the valley that now houses the "Parchwood", thrusting the surrounding mountains upward and infusing them with incredible amounts of [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md)—the physical residue of arcane energy.

The sheer amount of leftover arcane power within the [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) of the mountains is incredibly receptive to enchantment. Magic items that incorporate at least an ounce of [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items. Some alchemists in "Emon" have discovered that dissolving [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) with specific acids can leave behind pure [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md), which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.

If a spell has a component cost that consumes the component, its caster can substitute the required component for an amount of [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) of an equal value. One pound of pure [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) is worth approximately 500 gp in most markets, though it becomes extremely expensive and difficult to find outside of "Emon" or the city of "Whitestone" itself.

[Residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) can also be heated and blown into glass, forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables. Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates—easily 20,000 gp or more—may acquire an [enchanting slate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-enchanting-slate-tdcsr.md) that can be used to expedite the creation of all magic items. Using such a table allows anyone crafting a magic item to do so in one-quarter of the usual time.

#### Government

For many years, the de Rolo family ruled "Whitestone" with dignity and justice. Their noble rule was broken by Delilah Briarwood, an exiled necromancer of the Cerberus Assembly from "Wildemount", and her [vampire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) husband, Sylas. Together, they slaughtered the family, took over "Whitestone", and plunged the city into despair.

Nearly six years later, Vox Machina returned with [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md), the only known de Rolo heir, and discovered that his sister Cassandra also still lived. The heroes defeated the "Briarwoods" and expunged their evil from "Whitestone", and the de Rolo siblings founded a new system of governance: the "Chamber of Whitestone".

This council consists of members appointed by the Guardian of Woven Stone, who is to remain a member of the de Rolo bloodline as long as it exists, or until the rest of the Chamber unanimously agrees there are no suitable de Rolos to accept the position.

#### Defense

"Whitestone's" first line of defense is made up of the obelisk wards. Hastily constructed during the time of the "Chroma Conclave" to avoid detection by their roving [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) armies, five [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) obelisks mark the perimeter of the city and castle grounds. These obelisks form a dome of illusory magic when powered by an arcane spellcaster, hiding the city under the guise of continued, undeveloped "Parchwood", and shielding everything within from arcane detection. The obelisks haven't been used since the attack of the "Chroma Conclave" and are beginning to be covered by graffiti and overgrowth.

For each spell slot that is syphoned into an obelisk, two hours of illusion is powered per spell level sacrificed, and the cover of the illusion barrier is incomplete unless all five obelisks are powered simultaneously. This siphoning is a taxing experience, and for every 30 spell levels sacrificed within a 24-hour period, the caster gains 1 level of exhaustion.

In addition to this rarely used magical ward, three groups of defensive personnel protect "Whitestone" from both within and without.

##### Pale Guard

The people of "Whitestone" rely upon the Pale Guard to resolve any (admittedly rare) crimes and disturbances of the peace. The Pale Guard are a force of sentinels who answer to the Pale Lord of Wardship. Since criminal activity is fairly low these days, most of the Pale Guard are given other civic tasks to help "Whitestone's" people.

These tasks range from helping newcomers navigate the city streets to escorting visiting dignitaries to diplomatic functions. While performing a duty that requires it, members of the Pale Guard are permitted to carry simple, three-barrel pepperbox revolvers.

##### Whitestone Rifle Corps

The defense of the city from outside invaders and threats from the darkened boughs of the "Parchwood Timberlands" is attended to by the "Whitestone Rifle Corps", who are trained in the deadly long-range rifles created by [Percival de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md). They are only permitted to wield the weapons while patrolling the city walls or castle battlements—except in times of emergency, or when granted special permission by the "Chamber of Whitestone".

##### Grey Hunters

An elite force called the Grey Hunters makes up the most secret of "Whitestone's" defenses. Trained in the arts of hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, espionage, and etiquette, the Hunters have a reach that extends across all Tal'Dorei, but they exist only as a rumor in the eyes of the public—and they answer only to the "Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt".

The firearms wielded by members of the Grey Hunters are custom-made and named by their owner. Their rifles' stocks are made of "Parchwood" inlaid with [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) and enchanted against wear with [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md). The lock mechanism bears the "Whitestone" crest. Hunters are trained to meticulously care for their weapons, and many learn enough to make personal modifications, or even build one from scratch. A Hunter must never lose their weapon. If they cannot prove it was destroyed, they aren't permitted to return to "Whitestone" until it is recovered—although they may request help from other Hunters in retrieving it. If they come across a weapon of "Whitestone" in the wrong hands, they are honor-bound to return it to the city.

This covert organization is headquartered in the ruins of a failed city expansion deep beneath the eastern "Parchwood". This base is used for training, for weapon storage, and as a repository for their mission logs, so that a complete record of every Hunter and their weapons can forever be kept. As with many of his inventions, [Percival de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) fears that the Hunters are a powerful—and even necessary—tool in the hands of the righteous, but a terrible weapon, should they be perverted to suit evil.

#### Crime

The community of "Whitestone" has endured much hardship, from its shipwrecked beginnings to the bloody reign of the "Briarwoods". Its hardy people are generally more concerned with personal duty, small comforts, and the creation of new art and technologies than with the pursuit of easy profit. The "Myriad" has tried several times to gain a foothold in "Whitestone", but they've been foiled time and again by the consistent counterespionage efforts of the "Grey Hunters". Nevertheless, they continue to try, and their presence has inspired petty theft throughout the city.

The altruistic Lord [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) and Lady [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) of "Whitestone" prefer to address crime at the source—poverty and suffering—rather than punishing criminals. Likewise, most petty criminals are seen in "Whitestone" as worthy of rehabilitation, not punishment.

#### Geography

"Whitestone" was originally constructed around the newly discovered "Sun Tree", and has slowly expanded outward ever since. "Castle Whitestone" was built atop a small hill overlooking the city to the north. Over the years, farmers and homesteaders have cleared more and more of the "Parchwood" to the south of the city. Even today, as "Whitestone's" population has swelled, the "Parchwood" remains defiant, dark, and threatening. It is in little danger of being overrun by mortals, and its eerie creatures strike back whenever the people of "Whitestone" press against it too greedily. The "Grey Hunt" was formed to keep the deadly denizens of the woods at bay, though now their purview reaches farther than just the "Parchwood".

Dawnfather Square is the central district of "Whitestone". The square surrounds a small hill, and the golden glow of the revered "Sun Tree" that sits atop it can be seen throughout the city. Many of "Whitestone's" original settlers already worshiped the Dawnfather, and the discovery of the "Sun Tree" was seen as a sign. Today, Dawnfather Square is filled with quaint, bustling shops and small town-homes.

##### 1. Castle Whitestone

This gothic fortress was erected not long after the city's founding, and has long been the seat of power for the sovereign de Rolo family. [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) and Cassandra de Rolo have opted to end their absolute power over the city by sharing it with the "Chamber of Whitestone"—on which they each hold a seat.

The castle's interior has a certain stark regality to it. While the hunting trophies and tapestries that decorate its walls are clear signs of the de Rolos' ancestral wealth, there is a solemn, beautiful hollowness to its corridors. Cassandra de Rolo says that something of her brother's melancholy seeped into its [whitestone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/whitestone-tdcsr.md) walls, and the castle will always carry the weight of his sorrow—and of the "Briarwoods'" evil.

The castle itself is generally off-limits to the public, but its grounds are more accessible. The "Whitestone Rifle Corps" train in a firing yard behind the castle, and many people of the town flock to watch—only to be politely rebuffed by the "Pale Guard". Open to all, however, are the gardens—except for [Percival de Rolo's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) latest project, the Widow's Garden. This walled garden was named for Lady Melanie de Rolo, who originally cultivated its deadly blooms to slowly murder her husband. The Widow's Garden used to be a macabre menagerie of poisonous plants from across "Wildemount". It fell fallow during the reign of the "Briarwoods", but [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) has resurrected it with [Keyleth's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) horticultural aid.

##### 2. The Sun Tree

After the Chained Oblivion nearly consumed the Knowing Mistress during the "Calamity", a furious and vengeful Dawnfather pursued the fleeing Oblivion across the mountaintops and over the sea, to the peak of "Gatshadow", where the mad god was eventually defeated and imprisoned once again. The land wept with pain as the two wrathful gods laid waste to Tal'Dorei.

After his victory, the Dawnfather returned to "Whitestone" and placed a single seed into the ground where the Knowing Mentor was nearly destroyed. The god wept, and from the seed grew a symbol of protection—a tree with radiant orange foliage and a golden glow that surrounds it when in bloom. The Sun Tree became a beacon of light within the dark forest that enclosed it. While the extent of the tree's divine power remains a mystery, it stands as an emblem of unity and hope, both within the city of "Whitestone", and upon its official crest.

##### 3. Temples and the Greyfield

A patch of land outside the eastern wall of the city sees generations of "Whitestone's" dead interred within a graveyard known as the Greyfield. Custody of this cemetery is shared by the Temple of the Dawn and the Altar of the Raven, sanctuaries maintained by the clergy of the Dawnfather and the Matron of Ravens, respectively. Since most people in "Whitestone" consider the Dawnfather their patron deity, the Temple of the Dawn is the largest of these shrines. The smaller Altar of the Raven is right next door, and most well-to-do devotees of the Dawnfather look upon the dour, dark-robed clerics of the Matron of Ravens with a mixture of awe and unease.

The temples' grounds also house a number of mausoleums containing the remains of long-forgotten noble families, though the last generation of lost de Rolos were not recovered following the rule of the "Briarwoods". Traces of the "Briarwoods'" defiling magic still linger within the Greyfield, and the "Pale Guard" are posted here at night to quell the restless dead that occasionally claw their way to the surface.

##### 4. The Heart of Whitestone

A majestic clock tower called the Heart of "Whitestone" stands proud and tall over the city. It is [Percival de Rolo's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) favorite invention, one he dedicated much of the past two decades to constructing to honor his loyal friends, their sacrifices, and the trials they endured together. The area around it is known as Forlington Square, named for one of the first families to settle in "Whitestone". This bustling courtyard is lined with shops and street performers that attract locals and tourists alike.

The clock tower's construction was completed five years ago, but [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) continues to tinker with it, adding both functionality and self-indulgent embellishments. The tower has individual movements for "most major holidays", including depictions of famous moments and persons from "Whitestone" history. The clock tracks the movements of the moons, stars, and spheres. The mechanics of the clock are only truly understood by [Percy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) himself, though small clubs of scholars and esotericists take great joy in unraveling its mysteries. Further, it has long been rumored that [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) secreted a vault within the tower's innards to safeguard his most dangerous inventions.

##### 5. Snowdrop Memorial Trail

In the east of the city, winding between the "Grey Hunt Estate" and the temple to the Matron of Ravens, is a private trail through the woods. Only locals know of this trail, and even among them, few know that the path was made by [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) of "Zephrah" on one of her many visits to the city. Countless snowdrop flowers line this secluded track, and they are tended to by Lady [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) when she has time away from her duties to both the "Chamber of Whitestone" and the "Tal'Dorei Council". The significance of this memorial garden isn't listed on any plaque, but most in "Whitestone" have an inkling that it's dedicated to a beloved [champion of the god of death](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md).

##### 6. Grey Hunt Manor

The estate of the "Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt" is rarely used by the current holder of that title these days, as all her nights not spent away on "Tal'Dorei Council" business are passed with her family in "Castle Whitestone". Members of the "Grey Hunt" still use it as a formal meeting place—though meetings of true import take place in their secret lair in the eastern ruins (11).

##### 7. House of the Lawbearer

This temple is both a place of worship and a stately courthouse. All who enter are sworn to tell the truth by the vigilant clerics of the Lawbearer—for the entire building is under the protection of a vast, permanent [zone of truth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell. This protection is fallible, but it sends a clear message to all who enter.

##### 8. Slayer's Cake Bakery

Founded by members of Vox Machina, the Slayer's Cake has quickly become one of the most beloved bakeries in Tal'Dorei, and it has a satellite shop in "Emon". It ships bread and pastries to Nicodranas in "Wildemount" via [teleportation circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) weekly, and the bakery's owners are thinking of expanding.

##### 9. Lord Trinket's Public Park

A section of the "Parchwood" to the west of the city was cleared in the aftermath of The Whispered One's defeat in anticipation of a major expansion. However, more of the "Emonian" refugees left the city than anticipated, leaving these plans untenable, but the forest already cleared. At the request of [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md), Grand Mistress of the "Grey Hunt", the space was transformed into a public park that she uses to play with her now-venerable brown bear, [Trinket](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/trinket-tdcsr.md)—and a lifelike marble statue of that same bear, clad in magnificent armor, stands in its center.

Portions of this city expansion did eventually come to pass, and now several manor houses have been built near the edge of the park to house visiting dignitaries.

##### 10. Galdric's Gate

The new, northwestern gate of "Whitestone" opens onto the Timberland Trail, which grants hunters easy access to the city when they return from expeditions into the "Parchwood".

##### 11. Eastern Ruins

"Whitestone's" first expansion in recent times happened just after the fall of The Whispered One, to accommodate the city's large refugee population. However, a mix of social unrest and monstrous incursions from the "Parchwood" stymied the project, and the bones of the expansion were left to fall into ruin. No attempt has been made to reclaim the ruins, but the "Grey Hunt" have made a secret base of operations in the basement of a magnificent temple not yet dedicated to any god.

##### 12. Hearth of the Everlight

Established by [Pike Trickfoot](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/pike-trickfoot-tdcsr.md) in the years following Vox Machina's victory over The Whispered One, this humble temple stands as a bastion of welcoming light and shelter to those seeking solace and direction. Within its stone walls, the faithful of the Everlight study her philosophy of compassion and fierce protection. Still, the temple is far from tranquil—the congregation also hosts monthly fêtes and revels as a part of their worship in the image of their exuberant founder.

##### Dad Scientist (any level)

[Percival de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) doesn't usually involve outsiders in his creative process. However, when his youngest daughter Gwendolyn takes one of his latest creations and disappears into the dungeons of "Castle Whitestone", he has no choice but to rally all adventurers in "Whitestone" to join him, [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md), and the city's elite warriors in scouring the dungeons for his missing girl.

##### Matter of Some Importance (low-level)

The "Castle Whitestone" library recently acquired a new book containing unprecedented knowledge about the Outer Planes, but opening the tome also opens an infernal portal that summons a steady stream of [imps](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp.md). The characters are hired by Head Librarian JB Trickfoot to keep the [imps](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) out of her hair—and out of the library, please—while she scours the tome for information.

##### Grey Hunt (high-level)

The characters have been recommended to the "Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt" as formidable adventurers by an unknown ally—or adversary. [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) de Rolo considers them cautiously, but offers them the chance to prove themselves worthy of the title of "Grey Hunter". She sets them a task to be completed within the next three months: track down a legendary [ember roc](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ember-roc-tdcsr.md) in the "Cliffkeep Mountains" and claim its head as a trophy. Of course, she knows that this quest is more than just a hunt; the question is, will the characters realize it takes more than just skill to join the hunters?

## Dividing Plains

Tal'Dorei's vast heartland, framed by the "Stormcrest Mountains" in the southwest, the "Cliffkeeps" in the north, and the "Summit Peaks" in the south, contains miles and miles of rolling hills, tall-grass prairies, sky-blue rivers, and fertile farmlands. Within these plains, the hardworking people of the realm tend to their fields and businesses while adventurers and village militias battle back the wild beasts and wandering bandits of the region. The safest way to avoid being beset by monsters is to travel the "Silvercut Roadway", which slices through the endless plains, connects the coasts, and shepherds caravans between them. Of course, the roads are coursing with highwaymen and bandits, so which route is safer is entirely up to the traveler to decide. Cults of the "Betrayer Gods" also prey upon the people of the plains. The most fearsome of these death cults are the "Ravagers", a bloody band of warriors exiled from cities and nomadic clans alike. All people of the plains fear the "Ravagers", and even the smallest villages train people old enough to hold a spear how to defend their homes. Beyond the grassy plains, [owlbears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) and other monstrosities stalk the forests and foothills that dot the plains and border it on many sides. Packs of "centaurs" also gallop across the open plains, delivering the Arch Heart's justice as they see fit.

### The Bramblewood

Surrounding the base of the southernmost stretch of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" is the Bramblewood, a dark and tangled forest named for its jagged, thorny-barked trees. The Bramblewood's impenetrable canopy and thick, gnarled roots give it an ominous appearance, but its eerie boughs are populated with countless deadly beasts. It's a grim warning to all who would dare approach "Gatshadow", the mountain of despair: come no closer if you value your life.

Yet despite this, without the abundant game and plentiful timber of the Bramblewood, the nearby city of "Westruun" would likely not exist. A trade city with nothing to trade rarely lasts long, and the Bramblewood ensures that local carpenters, artisans, and tradesfolk always have plentiful resources. For those brave enough to venture into the Bramblewood, a pair of well-tread paths have resisted its overgrowth; one leads to the iron-rich Murdoon Mines at the base of the "Cliffkeeps", while the other winds upward to "Gatshadow's" storm-wreathed peak.

##### Haunted Road (mid-level)

Local folklore speaks of a spectral young woman sometimes appearing along the road through the forest, sobbing and leading men deeper into the "Bramblewood" to never be seen again. While these tales are generally considered childish ghost stories, a mining crew was recently found dead near the fabled spot, unwounded and with looks of terror stretched across their lifeless faces. A [banshee](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/banshee.md), aided by the [specters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) of those she has slain, hungers for the sweet taste of another adventurer's dying breaths.

##### Blood of the Ruiner (high-level)

The Shields, "Westruun's" beleaguered soldiery, have tracked a cell of "Ravagers" to a base in the "Bramblewood". They have conducted a foul ritual to the Ruiner to turn their cult master, an elf named Kalydria Darkeye, into a [Ravager slaughter lord](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ravager-slaughter-lord-tdcsr.md). They have also transformed a number of the [giant spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) endemic to the "Bramblewood" into hideous [demonfeed spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/demonfeed-spider-tdcsr.md) through the same bloody ritual. The "Ravagers" have created a makeshift fortification, and the Shields need to know what their next move is—an infiltration mission only powerful adventurers are capable of completing.

### Foramere Basin

This great lake was once the ice fortress of "Errevon the Rimelord", the elemental behemoth that nearly toppled the fledgling realm of Tal'Dorei just two years after its founding. It was here that the combined forces of "Kraghammer", "Syngorn", Tal'Dorei, and "the Ashari" hurled the Rimelord back into the Elemental Plane of Ice and brought an end to the "Icelost Years". The massive lake left behind by "Errevon's'" melted citadel is now the largest source of fresh water in central Tal'Dorei.

Foramere Basin's shores are peppered with tiny huts and fishing communities that trade with "Kymal" and "Westruun". The great lake is fed by three rivers that give life to the "Dividing Plains": the Byhills, the Tundrun, and the Wildpath. After especially hard winters, these rivers run hard and fast, and the overflows spill into the Foramere Waterway, which flows into Owlset Bay, near "Stilben".

Some of these fishing villages are home to the descendants of the fighters that warred against the Rimelord's tyranny. Even in times when "Syngorn" and "Kraghammer" were bitter rivals, the "elves" and "dwarves" here took no part in their homelands' hatred.

##### Nightmare Before Winter's Crest (mid-level)

The festival of Winter's Crest celebrates the anniversary of the Rimelord's defeat and the fall of Foramere Citadel. The characters, far from home on the holiday, are not only witness to the fishing communities on the banks of the basin gathering to celebrate Winter's Crest, but to the grim sight of Foramere's waters surging upward from the basin. The water has begun to freeze into towers of ice—someone or something is recreating the domain of "Errevon the Rimelord" and will not stop until all of Tal'Dorei is buried in ice.

![A dock in a winter storm w...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-foramere.webp#center "A dock in a winter storm with terrified sailors looking out and an older, weathered man pointing toward a tall, jagged shard of ice erupting from the water just off shore.")

### Ironseat Ridge

The [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) and hillsfolk of the "Dividing Plains" say the crooked, angular mountain that juts out of the plains and foothills was once the throne of a titan. From a distance, "Ironseat Ridge" does resemble a crooked chair. Whether or not this legend is true hardly matters; the tales of "Ironseat Ridge" permeate the folklore of the plains.

The mountains surrounding Ironseat itself have been hollowed out over the centuries, and other legends say that the ruins of an abandoned dwarven redoubt called Inverspire can be found by explorers savvy enough to navigate the labyrinthine tunnels—and that it's surely filled with monsters and vast riches. Legends aside, countless abandoned mineshafts do snake through the stone like the veins of a dead titan. When the winds grow strong, you can sometimes hear a terrible, growling moan from the air pressing through the empty channels. People from "Kymal" rarely venture close enough to the mountains to hear the noise, but sometimes on clear, silent nights, the monstrous sound echoes through "Kymal's" brightly lit streets.

##### The Beast Below (any level)

It's one of those still nights where the howls of the Ironseat echo across the plains. The next time the characters spend a night in town, whether in "Kymal" or any small village of the plains, they learn of disappearances—explorers that went into the caves, never to return—and of the hefty reward their grieving families are offering for their return. What could be making that awful wailing in the caves? [Werewolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf.md)? Kidnappers using the echoing caverns?

##### Dead Fires of Inverspire (epic-level)

The mythic redoubt of Inverspire contains a legendary creation of the All-Hammer: a [forge guardian](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/forge-guardian-tdcsr.md). It was placed here by the All-Hammer during the "Calamity" to watch over a forge with the power to create arms and armor fit only for a war between gods and mortals. Over twenty years ago, the elemental power of the "Cinder King" somehow ignited this divine creation's ashen heart and filled it with elemental life. It has turned to the forge it was made to guard, and has begun creating beings of steel and flame that will tear Tal'Dorei apart stone by stone in order to find its missing father, the All-Hammer. Only definitive proof of the All-Hammer's imprisonment beyond the Divine Gate can quench the guardian's anguished flames.

### Ivyheart Thicket

Clustered at the western side of the "Ironseat Ridge", this thicket contains the ruins of an ancient civilization that remains under study by the "Alabaster Lyceum". Among scattered relics and the rubble of forgotten villages lie references to the "Founding": the first age of the world. The excavation pushes onward under the watch of the "Lyceum", with the promise of discovery looming, but very little understanding of what may be found beneath.

The western edges of these ruins are the most dangerous—and the most alluring—part of the Ivyheart Thicket. A vast, well decorated with ivy-crept marble pillars, burns with eternal fire. Explorers in the employ of the "Alabaster Lyceum" say that this place has become a hotbed of activity. [Azer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/azer.md) have flocked to it from the Elemental Plane of Fire, and have made it their home, forging beautiful bronze weapons, armor, and *objets d'art*. The "Lyceum" reports that elemental activity within the nearby redoubt of Inverspire is somehow related to this elemental incursion—and that it may be connected to the mythic fire giant stronghold of "Vulkanon".

### Kymal

- **Small City.** Population 29,440 (63% "humans", 24% "dwarves", 13% "other races")  

Glitzy. Gilded. Grimy. The city of Kymal stands as the grumbling ghost of a gold-rush boomtown. These days, it's a haven for gamblers and criminals: a city of gold built atop a mountain of mud.

Over two centuries before, the discovery of rich gold veins within the "Ironseat Ridge" sent a rush of eager folk to its base. Kymal began life as their base camp, and over the next century it grew into a lively, booming city. [Gold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gold.md) and minerals came out of Kymal, and all the pleasures of home followed. Music, theater, sex, food, liquor, drugs, trinkets—if you could want it, you could find it in Kymal. Anything you could spend money on was there, and people spent money like the world was ending. The rich binged anything they could get their hands on to pretend they were important, and poor folk indulged in whatever comfort they could find from their wretched existence in a town where money meant everything.

In time, of course, the veins ran dry. Ten years after Kymal boomed into being, it went bust. The miners packed up and left. Not many of them had struck it rich; in fact, most folk were worse off than they had been before. In the intervening centuries, Kymal has gone through too many cycles of boom and bust to count. New veins of gold or mithral or adamantine have been found in the mountains, and people rush in to claim it. Or a cunning entrepreneur comes up with a scheme to put Kymal on the map—and it works, for a few years, before the con runs its course and people are right back to where they were before.

Most folk here make a modest living in rural villages surrounding Kymal's city center, or trawling the nearby "Foramere Basin" for fish, and are trying to build interest as a trade center like "Westruun", though without much luck. Kymal's most recent change of fortune, however, has yet to run dry. Some seventy years ago, an entrepreneur from "Ank'Harel" named Calis Krishtan opened a small casino called "The Maiden's Wish." It started something of a gold rush of its own, one that continues to this day.

The city has grown over the past seventy years, becoming a hub of entertainment and games of chance in Tal'Dorei. So great was Calis's revival of Kymal that the "Tal'Dorei Council" appointed his son (and heir to the Maiden's Wish), Jaktur Krishtan, the Margrave of Kymal.

#### Government

Now entering old age, Margrave Jaktur Krishtan is desperately trying to maintain the boom that his father created, while grooming his son to take over his gambling empire. Krishtan has recently made headlines across Tal'Dorei by relinquishing his position as margrave. It's an open secret that Jaktur Krishtan has never had a head for governance, simply enjoying the lavish, gold-plated life his casinos' profits bring him. He could easily have allowed his advisors to continue running "Kymal" for him while he continued to throw magnificent galas, make nightly appearances at the Maiden's Wish, and put his stamp of approval on glitzy parades down the city's main street.

Investigators have flocked to "Kymal" to uncover the truth of Margrave Krishtan's sudden change of heart. All suspect that the truth is a salacious secret, one which would shake "Kymal" to its foundations. Krishtan himself seems unperturbed. He continues to live large as he always has, his detractors don't disparage him any more than usual, and the public that loves him hasn't changed their tune.

Jaktur's former majordomo, an austere tiefling woman named Khavasta "Prudence" Almiji, has taken up the mantle of Acting Margrave with quiet satisfaction. It is, after all, the title that she should have had for the past thirty years, and she hopes that the "Tal'Dorei Council" will see fit to appoint her margrave permanently in very short order.

#### Defense

The acting margrave commands a force of about one thousand armed guards called the Public Defense. Despite the name, they are most often seen stationed around the casinos owned by ex-Margrave Krishtan, or working as bodyguards for "Kymal's" politicians and wealthy cardsharps. Gold can buy anything in "Kymal", even the personal protection of the Public Defense.

#### Crime

"Kymal" is no longer the den of crime it once was, but there is still scum beneath its glitzy and imperfect façade. Small-time cutpurses lurk in the shadows, waiting to make off with the small fortunes won by the casinos' luckiest patrons. The war between the "Clasp" and the "Myriad" smolders within "Kymal" as well, but Acting Margrave Almiji has played her cards carefully and intelligently. Through an intricate web of bribes, promises, and threats, she has managed to suppress even the faintest trace of gang violence within her city.

Of course, crime still occurs in "Kymal". It's just not public and bloody. The "Clasp" and "Myriad" both own casinos in town—named the Wishing Well and the Dragon's Hoard, respectively. Not many know of these casinos' less-than-savory proprietorship. Even those who do fail to realize just how deeply rigged its tables are—or how many pickpockets and swindlers hide in plain sight in their gilded halls.

Moreover, the "Clasp" and "Myriad" alike have immense illicit drug operations within "Kymal". The "Public Defense" is technically bound to arrest anyone caught selling or possessing these substances, but the bulk of these arrests fall on small-time crooks working for these criminal organizations, almost never the high-ranking members.

#### Geography

"Kymal" is built on the rocky foothills of the "Ironseat Ridge". Exploring beyond the glamorous city leads one to nothing but a desolate expanse of boulders and scrub-brush.

### Ruins of Torthil

While traveling south of "Kymal" along the "Wildwood Byway", just outside of the Ivyheart Thicket, travelers can spot a mile-wide cluster of broken stone, salted earth, and a single obsidian monument to the death of Warren "Drassig", one of the most infamous and terrible figures in Tal'Dorei history. This scarred patch of land marks the ruins of the village of Torthil, which was the site of a pivotal battle of the "Scattered War"—one in which King Warren "Drassig" was ambushed and slain by a rebel army.

The city was destroyed in an act of vengeance by Warren's eldest son Neminar over two centuries ago. Now, its ruins harbor only memories—and occasionally outlaws and cultists who use the ghost stories that surround it to avoid suspicion. The now long-weathered wreckage and broken foundations of the town harbor only ghosts and unsavory creatures drawn to places of such dark history.

#### Ruins of Torthil Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the Ruins of "Torthil" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Forgotten War Machine (high-level)

The Ruins of "Torthil" hold one lost secret. Buried beneath a landslide in one of the nearby hills is a [platinum golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/platinum-golem-tdcsr.md). Any crests that may have indicated who it fought for—Tal'Dorei's rebels, the "elves" of "Syngorn", or "Drassig's" legions—have been scoured away by time. The characters are drawn to "Torthil" when exiles and criminals living in the ruins flood into "Kymal", saying that a greedy treasure hunter awakened a metallic monster that laid waste to the already ruined town—and is now making its way steadily toward "Kymal"!

### Shadebarrow

No one who has visited the "Shadebarrow" has ever returned alive—but neither do they come back entirely dead. The "Shadebarrow" was once a monolithic henge used as a ritual site for sun-worshiping druids known as the Dawn Circle, but their shrine became their tomb after "Trist Drassig" slew them for aiding "Zan Tal'Dorei" in the "Scattered War", centuries ago.

After "Trist Drassig's" death, the trade guilds of "Westruun" laid claim to the unowned land, and from there, the Dawn Circle's abandoned and treasure-less burial tunnels were purchased from the unions at great cost by an eccentric "Westruunian" baron named Sevil Howthess. His obsession with its history led him to be interred there upon his passing, the tomb outfitted with protections and, supposedly, the remnants of his fortune.

The exact location of the "Shadebarrow" has been forgotten by all but the Baron Howthess's few surviving grandchildren, and they deny any involvement with the forgotten crypt. The surviving descendants of Sevil Howthess, Camilla Tenver and Buddleia Austan, live in "Westruun", but have changed their names through marriage. Only searching through the public records in "Westruun's" "Hall of Reason" or seeking lore about the "Shadebarrow" in the "Cobalt Reserve" will turn up their names.

Despite the barrow's location being lost to time, treasure hunters and historians still seek out—and occasionally find—the infamous crypt. If they ever return to civilization, it is as a wailing spirit, cursed to eternally torment whoever they thought of in their final moments, or as a shambling corpse focused only on murdering their loved ones.

#### Shadebarrow Adventures

The "Shadebarrow" is a crypt that you can turn into a dungeon of any size in your campaign. It may have only a single layer filled with [ghosts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md), and perhaps a plot-important item. Or it could be a multi-level dungeon with interconnected passages and a mighty reward at the bottom, like a "Vestige of Divergence" guarded by a terrible monster.

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Shadebarrow" can also use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Forsaken Monolith (low-level)

While traveling across the "Dividing Plains", the characters stumble upon the "Shadebarrow". The ancient druidic henges stand regally atop the grassy hill, and all seems peaceful—until the [specters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) of dead explorers rise from the ground. They wail an incessant curse as they try to kill or scare intruders away: "Defiler! Howthess!"

##### Undeath Unbound (epic-level)

The Demon Prince of Undeath is one of the foul princes of the Abyss and a mighty servant of the "Betrayer Gods". The cruelty shown at the Dawn Circle so long ago drew his loathsome gaze, and for centuries he has bided his time, waiting for a mortal to disturb this nest of hate and undeath. Ever since Baron Howthess disturbed the "Shadebarrow's" seal, this prince of evil has rallied an army of undeath in the accursed depths of this crypt. Now, the time has come for him to spill his plague of undeath across the "Dividing Plains". The undead are spreading to all corners of Tal'Dorei, and the characters must find the "Shadebarrow" and reach its deepest sanctum to halt their spread for good.

### Silvercut Roadway

Named for the shimmer of endless fields of windswept, sunlit grasses that accompany the way, the "Silvercut Roadway" connects the heart of Tal'Dorei—"Emon"—to its distant extremities, affording traders and travelers some measure of safety against the wilds. Parts of this ancient road predate the "Tal'Dorei Council", and it now runs from the "Bladeshimmer Shoreline" to the "Lucidian Coast", connecting most major hubs of civilization across the country.

#### Silvercut Crossroads

The "Silvercut Roadway" and the "Wildwood Byway" meet in the shadow of the "Ironseat Ridge". During the rule of "Drassig", many innocents and war heroes were executed by hanging at a massive gallows that once stood at the crossroads, with bodies hung from signs as a warning to dissenters. The gallows were destroyed by "Zan Tal'Dorei's" rebel army, and the rebels created a stone monument with an inscription to commemorate all who lost their lives to tyranny:

> [!quote]-  
> 
> The standard-bearers of revolution honor the innocent dead. Vengeance will not restore the lives of the lost, nor will it appease their spirits. We vow you will receive justice, for justice will ensure that no more guiltless blood shall be shed.

Most travelers choose not to camp too closely to the site, for there are countless urban legends about hauntings that surround this grim monument.

##### The Road Warriors (low-level)

While traveling across the Silvercut, the characters come across the smoking wreckage of a massive wagon train, and investigation shows that it has been ransacked after a fierce battle. A team of mercenaries called the Road Warriors spring upon the characters, blaming them for the attack. Investigating the wreckage turns up unholy symbols of the Ruiner, suggesting that the "Ravagers" were responsible for the massacre, allowing the characters to easily clear their names.

But is it really that simple? Further investigation reveals that this convoy had a number of mercenary mages in their midst, and many of them had contracts from the "League of Miracles".

##### Shard of the Shadebarrow (mid-level)

A [wraith](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) calling herself the spirit of Archdruid Avandros has animated an army of [ghouls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) and [ghasts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghast.md) from the graveyard. The undead have taken over the "Silvercut Crossroads", and they must be dealt with before a national trade crisis emerges. But what is the spirit of an archdruid of the Dawn Circle doing in this mass grave? Sneaking into the graveyard reveals a human skull with sinister amethyst growths protruding from the bone, and Avandros's spirit is desperate to protect it.

The man in the back holds a glowing polearm and the man in front aims a longbow as the woman in the middle wields a sword, her right foot illuminated by a glowing white circle of Will-O'-Wisps.")

### Throne of the Arch Heart

In the foothills of the "Ironseat Ridge" is a small rise known as the Throne of the Arch Heart: a gathering place for the many nomadic "centaurs" who ride across the "Dividing Plains". The "centaurs" were first born when the Arch Heart showed mercy to a tribe of elven horse riders who gave their lives serving their god during the "Calamity". For centuries, the "centaurs" have all returned to the Throne of the Arch Heart once per decade to gather in a Herdsmeet to discuss the state of the herds, and to pay homage to their deity on the very hill where the first "centaurs" were created. This event causes great chaos in the eastern plains; the massive migration of the centaur herds disrupts trade and stirs the "Ravagers" to acts of terrible vengeance against the creations of the Arch Heart—the Ruiner's divine nemesis.

Game Masters who set their adventure in the Throne of the Arch Heart can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Fist of the Ruiner (mid-level)

Many "orcs" call this rise the Fist of the Ruiner, for they too were created here in the image of their god. Legend tells that [orcs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) and "centaurs" were both created at this rise in the aftermath of a battle between the Arch Heart and the Ruiner. "Orcs" with a deep appreciation for ancient myths from across Tal'Dorei make a pilgrimage at the time of the Herdsmeet. Some are long-time friends of the "centaurs", and they pay homage to the Arch Heart together in thanks for spilling the blood that created them. Other "orcs" join with the "Ravagers" to lay siege to the Herdsmeet—and the "Ravagers'" bloodthirsty power is so great that [orcs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) and "centaurs" alike have begun hiring humanoid mercenaries to defend the herds and pilgrims as they attempt to worship the Arch Heart in peace.

### Torian Forest

Cradling the southwestern edge of the Cliffkeep Mountain range, the Torian Forest supplies much of "Emon's" timber, as well as "Kraghammer's" firewood. Though its locals proudly proclaim the Torian to be the "most welcoming" and "least haunted" of Tal'Dorei's forests, this is more of a myth than people realize. The forest is welcoming and bright at its edges, with a beautiful wetland at its northern end, but within its deep and unexplored heart are spirits not understood since the "Age of Arcanum"—and a cruel and hungry [wraithroot tree](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/wraithroot-tree-tdcsr.md) guarding a magical artifact likewise not seen since time immemorial.

#### Rivermaw Herd

Born from the wild peoples of the "Dividing Plains", free folk who shunned the constraints of society, the Rivermaw is the greatest of the "Dividing Plains'" herds. It now boasts a membership of nearly ten thousand, along with a number of satellite herds that owe their allegiance to the Rivermaw.

Though the Rivermaw is now a mighty force for good on the "Dividing Plains", they had humble beginnings. Just two generations ago, they numbered little more than three hundred "half-giants", "orcs", "gnolls", "humans", and nomads of other races that made their home in the Torian Forest.

It wasn't until they were conquered by the Herd of Storms, helmed by the tyrannical goliath Kevdak, that a more violent way of life was forced upon them for a number of years. Once Kevdak was slain, the remaining members of both the Rivermaw and the Herd of Storms recanted his brutal ways and become the "Rivermaw herd" known across Tal'Dorei today. It is led by two "goliaths": Zanroar, son of Kevdak, and Skyhaal, daughter of Zanroar.

### Turst Fields

- **Village.** Population 2,420 (40% "humans", 38% "halflings", 15% "gnolls", 8% "other races")  

To the northwest of "Drynna", not far from the Dawnmist Pines, the farming community of Turst Fields toils over extremely fertile land fed by the "Mooren River Run". Providing much of Tal'Dorei and "Whitestone's" grown food and produce, the community must import most all other commodities outside of wood, making it a lucrative stop for trade caravans traveling along the Parchwood Way to "Drynna"—and an easy target for swindlers. As such, nearly two hundred Shields from "Westruun" are permanently stationed here to keep the peace and prevent unlawful activity. Nearly as common as the arrival of a trader's wagon is an armored carriage transporting brigands, grifters, and horse thieves back to "Westruun" for trial.

#### Gnoll Mercy

"Turst Fields" has a significant [gnoll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) population. As mutant beings created by demonic rituals, [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) are shunned as monsters in most humanoid settlements on the "Dividing Plains". Nevertheless, without the Dustpaw [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md), Turst would not have survived its first summer. When the village was founded, it was easy prey for the "Ravagers". Their leader sought blood tribute from the people of Turst, but the villagers refused to offer a sacrifice. This cell of "Ravagers" had recently sought the favor of the Demon Lord of Slaughter, transforming a number of the plains-dwelling hyenas into [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) in that pursuit.

When the villagers of Turst refused to give up their own, the "Ravagers" unleashed the [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) upon them. But something unusual happened. After the [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) first drew blood, one of them began to weep. Then another, until all of the [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) were howling in sorrow and fury. These beings, though infused with demon ichor, turned against their creators to defend their helpless prey.

To this day, the Dustpaw [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) have lingered in Turst, slowly becoming trusted members of their community. Their unsettling fangs and canine faces upset many who travel to this village, but any who deride the [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) do so at their own risk. Not at the risk of mauling from a [gnoll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md)—though any humanoid being will fight back if pushed too far—but because hateful agitators will soon find themselves surrounded by the spears of the Turst militia.

#### Turst Fields Adventures

##### Herd Mentality (mid-level)

A half-elf, half-"dragonblood" [Ravager slaughter lord](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ravager-slaughter-lord-tdcsr.md) calling herself Grud the Great has taken control of an arm of the "Ravagers". Her highly organized regiment worships the Strife Emperor. Now, they march on Turst to take an easy foothold in the northern plains. The army is too large to be stopped by just the characters, but a Dustpaw [gnoll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) warrior named Akaksa knows of a number of nomadic groups wandering nearby that could help defend the town, if properly persuaded. The characters can seek out the Dawnmist Herd, led by a goliath [Rivermaw stormborn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/rivermaw-stormborn-tdcsr.md) named Gardessk, and convince him to aid the people of Turst.

### Westruun

- **City.** Population 51,980 (61% "humans", 10% "gnomes", 7% "tieflings", 5% "orcs", 4% "half-giants", 1% "gnolls", 12% "other races")  

The city of Westruun is the center of Tal'Dorei, a crossroads of culture along the "Silvercut Roadway" that welcomes adventurers, traders, and vagabonds of all kinds. Despite its name, Westruun is more east than west, and was in fact named after Palest Westruun, the trader and philosopher who founded the city. Westruun suffered under the rule of the goliath tyrant Kevdak's Herd of Storms. Worse, its outlying towns and great stone buildings were ravaged by the acidic breath of Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, an [ancient black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md) of the "Chroma Conclave" who exacted tribute from his lair in the eerie mountain of "Gatshadow". Despite the damage inflicted by its evil rulers, Westruun was one of the first cities in Tal'Dorei to recover from the "Conclave". Though its government is deeply in debt to both the "League of Miracles" and a number of adventuring parties, the city has long since reclaimed its place of importance as an economic, academic, and political power within Tal'Dorei.

#### Government

"Westruun" underwent a political revolution in the wake of the "Chroma Conclave's" defeat. The former margrave, Brandon Zimmerset, was a tyrant who claimed absolute power for himself following Kevdak's defeat at the hands of Vox Machina. The title of margrave is a holdover from the authoritarian rule of Warren "Drassig" centuries ago, and those who hold that office are appointed for life by the council. A group of local idealists called the Retrievers banded with adventurers and mercenaries to overthrow Zimmerset a decade after he took power, and instated their leader as the lord mayor instead. Elections for the position of Lord Mayor of "Westruun" are held every five years, with no term limits. All adult citizens of the city who have lived there for at least five years have a vote, though only a fraction of the people actually use it.

The Retrievers continue to be a political force in "Westruun", and several of "Westruun's" delegates to the "Tal'Dorei Council" are members of this faction. They are campaigning to abolish the office of margrave from all settlements in Tal'Dorei. Though they have broad support in the council, the council doesn't have the authority to unilaterally demand its constituent city-states to change their system of government. The revolution-minded Retrievers are somewhat stifled by the need to compromise with other cities.

Lord Mayor Lysandra Kallos is a middle-aged goliath and former leader of the Retrievers. She has never lost a vote for re-election, and holds executive power over the city's defenses, along with the ability to dissolve any business or guild, and to exile any person or group of up to ten people from the city at her discretion. She rules "Westruun" with the aid of a council of ten advisors.

#### Defense

The lord mayor commands a city guard of about 1,200 trained soldiers known as the Shields of the Plain, though most folk just call them the Shields. "Westruun's" soldiery is spread thin across the walls of the city itself, stationed at the gates of the dozens of outlying settlements and conducting raids against small cells of "Ravagers" across the plains.

Many people in town would like to gather their forces and put an end to the "Ravagers'" death cult once and for all, but the Shields are spread too thin to mount an effective offensive. Even in their current state, dozens—if not hundreds—of mercenaries, bounty hunters, and adventurers pass through "Westruun" every year in search of bloody work that the Shields are too beleaguered to handle themselves.

#### Debt

Before he was ousted, Margrave Brandon Zimmerset authorized hundreds of reconstruction bounties—offers of gold to anyone who could rebuild the immense damage the city suffered during Umbrasyl's attack and the Herd of Storms' occupation of the city. Bounties were placed on the city's siege-breaking stone walls, majestic towers and parapets, and even its iconic post-and-beam houses, many of which were razed completely during the attack.

The margrave expected these bounties to be slowly completed over decades, but they were all snapped up and completed in a few short years by mercenary mages serving a group called the "League of Miracles". The margrave was saddled with a crushing debt, one that he was both unwilling and unable to pay before being ousted by the Retrievers. As his successor, Lord Mayor Lysandra Kallos inherited Zimmerset's immense debt to the "League", and is constantly seeking to find ways to alleviate their pressure—especially as the league continues to use the debt as leverage to buy the allegiance of her advisory council.

#### Crime

The "Clasp" has become a major and public force in "Westruun" since the criminal organization's dubiously virtuous makeover following the "Cinder King's" defeat in "Emon". Many "Clasp" agents enjoy the reputation of folk heroes across the "Dividing Plains", and make public appearances in taverns and town squares throughout "Westruun".

Nevertheless, the fact remains that the "Clasp" is still a criminal organization. They have controlled and efficiently run their shadowy trades for decades right under the Shields' noses. Their network of fences runs from coast to coast, "Stilben" to "Emon". Their hideout changes every few years, when the Shields manage to track them down. Their current hideout is secreted away behind the storefront of the Saddled Plainscow, a popular tavern owned and operated by "Clasp" agents.

Folk in search of real folk heroes often seek the covert agents of the "Golden Grin", who tend to wait and watch in local taverns. The Grin sometimes gets a bad reputation in "Westruun", since people need help every day, but the Grinners prefer to wait for just the right moment to reveal themselves and strike against evil.

#### Geography

Miles of farmland and fields surround "Westruun's" towering stone walls—except to the west, where the city is bordered by the "Bramblewood" and dwarfed by the mist-shrouded peak of "Gatshadow". Nearly two dozen villages and towns surround the city's walls.

The city's interior is divided into six wards:

##### Scholar Ward

The city's small southern ward is replete with major temples to the "Prime Deities" and homes for their clergy. The most important gods of the "Dividing Plains" are the Lawbearer, the Wildmother, and the Platinum Dragon, and it's made obvious by their huge, resplendent sanctuaries in the Temple Ward. The greatest temples here are the First Bastion, the Wild Arbor, and the Platinum Dragon's Rest.

##### Opal Ward

"Westruun's" central district is also its municipal heart. The ward has no residential housing, but is home to the Lord Mayor's Residence, the "Hall of Reason", and the public square.

##### Residential Ward

The northeastern section of "Westruun" is the city's most densely populated ward, housing over two-thirds of its population. There are no major landmarks in this ward, though every neighborhood in the ward has its own unique culture. Even though tourists might not visit the landmarks here, there are countless local bakeries, shops, and pubs beloved by its residents.

This ward is rife with crime. "Westruun's" poorest citizens are pressed together in tight quarters, sometimes as little as a single city block away from the city's wealthiest manor houses. The "Clasp" and the "Myriad" prey upon the poor and affluent alike, often stoking the tensions affecting the city's downtrodden to create chaos that masks their crimes. The Shields are stretched too thin to properly deal with these agitators. Unlike in the Temple Ward, free expression of religion is not a guaranteed right here, even within the privacy of one's own home. Though the Lawbearer, the Wildmother, and the Platinum Dragon are all benevolent deities, many of their "Westruunian" followers are not particularly tolerant of other faiths.

##### Market Ward

"Westruun's" southwestern ward contains the majority of its businesses, trade stands, and production warehouses. Some of these businesses are historic fixtures of the city, rebuilt by the "League of Miracles" in years past, but many sell overpriced wares to cater to tourists, adventurers, and the city's wealthy elite.

It's currently in fashion for store owners to live in a second story above their shops, though less scrupulous businesspeople have turned their residences into gambling dens, black markets, and illegal brothels. The most significant building in this ward is the Exandrian Exchange, a marble-walled auction house where hundreds of vendors hawk rare and unusual items from across Tal'Dorei. A satellite location of "Gilmore's Glorious Goods", a famed magic item shop in "Emon", is a beloved attraction of this district.

##### Underwalk Ward

The city's newest ward is underground. It's an extension of the residential sprawl built from repurposed sections of the sewers, underground military bunkers, and the wine cellars of mansions annihilated by Umbrasyl and the Herd of Storms.

The Underwalk was frantically excavated during the invasion of the "Chroma Conclave" in hopes of keeping the populace hidden. It has been largely abandoned for the past twenty-four years, save for those too poor to return even to the Residential Ward, but an effort has been made in the past two years to create a unique and vibrant ecosystem in the Underwalk. The optimistic entrepreneurs trying to popularize Underwalk housing hire adventurers in great quantities, for every day, new and unsettling rumors of many-headed monstrosities prowling the Underwalk's shadowed roads spread to the surface. The best-known entrance to this tangle of tunnels is the Underwalk Gates, a forty-foot-wide staircase in the Residential Ward that descends into a gaping opening lit only by torchlight. Another entrance known mostly to the "Clasp" is a single unassuming manhole in the Opal Ward, topped with a metal cover emblazoned with the crest of "Westruun".

#### Points of Interest

The City of "Westruun" has a number of noteworthy landmarks. They are keyed to the map of "Westruun".

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-westruunmapplayer.webp#gallery)

##### 1. Cobalt Reserve

This vast repository looks more like a house of worship than a library. Nevertheless, this landmark of the Scholar Ward is Tal'Dorei's largest house of knowledge, and it is maintained and fiercely defended by the monks of the "Library of the Cobalt Soul".

A character who spends 1 hour in the public section of the Cobalt Reserve can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check, discovering any piece of common knowledge in Tal'Dorei. On a failure, this check can be repeated after another hour of study. The GM can decide that the knowledge the character seeks can only be found in the restricted archives, which only members of the "Cobalt Soul", or characters in the "Cobalt Soul's" good graces, can access.

##### 2. Westhall Academy

No university in Tal'Dorei can hope to compete with the prestige of "Emon's" "Alabaster Lyceum", but the Westhall Academy does its best. Its sand-colored stone walls and copper-patina dome are an unmistakable landmark of the Scholar Ward. They imply a stately and refined institution with an unpretentious, workaday attitude. Most of the Westhall Academy's students come from humble backgrounds, and the lord mayor does her level best to ensure that the academy is funded enough to let anyone from the plains who shows great promise attend, free of cost. Mages, architects, poets, artists, agriculturalists, and people of all disciplines can find an education at Westhall.

##### 3. Yuminor Observatory

"Westruun" is a fairly flat city, and one tower on the edge of the Scholar Ward looms high above the nearby "Westhall Academy in Westruun". It looks forever skyward, the arcanists inside constantly charting the movements of the heavens. A quasi-religious order of diviners and astromancers named the Scions of Yuminor study here, supported by the academy's headmistress, Estella Ladimar, who is herself a blood descendant of the heroic wizard Atz Yuminor. The observatory is open to all, and the diviners here will gladly give a star reading for 10 gp, once per day. Receiving this reading allows you to roll `1d20`. Note the result—you can exchange it for any `d20` roll made by a creature you can see. This divination fades after 24 hours. Despite the Scions of Yuminor's affability, something seems odd about them, like they have stared into the stars just a bit too long and seen something they wish they could forget.

![A red cloaked individual l...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-yuminorobservatory.webp#center "A red cloaked individual looks toward a massive, tall tower with a golden spherical observatory affixed to it's top, consisting of an intricate telescope housed in a gyroscopic apparatus. Behind the tower loom large, snowy mountains in a purple, dusky sky.")

##### 4. First Bastion

The most magnificent of the temples within "Westruun's" Temple Ward is the First Bastion. Dedicated to the Lawbearer, this opulent sanctuary is a common attraction for visiting folk of all faiths. Its magnificent, even decadent, gold-and-marble exterior is a sight most people can't imagine exists upon the Material Plane—it seems like nothing less than a building from the realm of the gods themselves. The First Bastion was a secret home for refugees during Kevdak's occupation, and many "Westruun" survivors have turned to the faith of the Lawbearer after being protected by her grace.

##### 5. Lord Mayor's Residence

The Lord Mayor's Residence is a squat manor in the Opal Ward. It was originally named the Margrave's Keep, and as such, it is a defensible and highly fortified compound buttressed against military barracks. The interior has been livened up significantly by the lord mayor, but the exterior is still a spare, military edifice.

##### 6. Hall of Reason

This beautiful courthouse in the Opal Ward is constructed in sweeping Lyrengornian style and bears a marble statue of the Platinum Dragon above its steps. The square before the courtroom steps is a forum for public gatherings and bears a fountain depicting Palest Westruun, the founder of the city, atop an onyx horse.

##### 7. The Black King

Palest Westruun was not a king, but his new statue in the Opal Ward is often called the [Black King](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/black-king-tdcsr.md), a subtle jab at the city's previous "Black King," the tyrannical dragon Umbrasyl. The high priest of the First Bastion blessed both the [Black King](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/black-king-tdcsr.md) and "Westruun" itself when the statue was unveiled on the anniversary of "Westruun's" reclamation, saying, "May the Lawbearer grant us all strength of spirit when chaos next threatens our peaceful civilization. When that time comes, may the [Black King](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/black-king-tdcsr.md) unsheathe his sword to rally our people and lead "Westruun" to victory."

When the safety of all of "Westruun" is threatened, the [Black King](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/black-king-tdcsr.md) will animate and defend its people, becoming a [stone golem with a speed of 60 feet, Charisma and Intelligence scores of 18 (+4), and the ability to speak Common](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/black-king-tdcsr.md). Its personality is dour but determined—regal and single-minded in its desire to protect its city and its people.

##### 8. Survivors' Legacy

The names of all those in "Westruun" who survived the reign of Kevdak and Umbrasyl are carved on a wall in the first chamber of the Underwalk. Legend has it that the memorial was created by [Percival de Rolo](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) when the people of "Westruun" first hid here from the wrath of the "Chroma Conclave" after Umbrasyl's death, but it has been expanded in the years since, now including the names of all who perished in the struggle as well.

The Survivors' Legacy is a symbol of hope, warding away the sorrow and evil of the Underwalk beneath, and to this day common, folk make trips here to honor their lost loved ones. Some of the more generous folk give aid to the homeless living here as well, and some more adventurous travelers make prayers to the Dawnfather and the Matron of Ravens here before delving into the Underwalk's deeper reaches.

Once per week, a character related to one of the people named on the Survivors' Legacy can pray there and gain advantage on death saving throws for the next 24 hours.

#### Westruun Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Westruun" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### They Can't Have Flown Away (low-level)

Over the past week, over four dozen [plainscows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/plainscow-tdcsr.md), exceptional livestock and beasts of burden, have disappeared from "Westruun's" outlying villages. Left in their place were nothing but a series of five-foot holes in the ground and traces of acid scarring. Farmers and caravanners alike are frightened and confused; these recurring attacks threaten to destroy "Westruun's" agriculture and disrupt commerce. Jeremiah Sook, head of the regional Rancher's Guild, is willing to pay a hefty bounty for the culprits.

##### An Assistant's Plight (mid-level)

Just outside "Westruun" is Slaterock Tower, the abode of renowned archmage "Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien". Normally, none are invited to the tower, but the characters, wherever they may be, receive a missive from the Realmseer's assistant, Jekt. The letter claims the Realmseer has gone missing within the tower, and the building itself now bars Jekt's entry—and apparently, the Realmseer's exit. Upon arrival, and confirmation of Jekt's request, the tower seems to constantly shift its interior structure, almost acting like a sentient entity. Challenge after deadly challenge is thrown at the party as they traverse the labyrinthine paths of the tower, only to find that the Realmseer himself is actually trying to keep something far more dangerous imprisoned within.

##### The Stuff of Nightmares (mid-level)

Reports of missing children rise once again within "Westruun", with a seemingly unrelated scourge of nightmares plaguing people old and young alike. Mystic expertise is sought to acquire information regarding either issue, but the sadistic [oni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/oni.md), secretly responsible for both, is deft at erasing its tracks. Nyx and Vryll, twin tiefling mages with only a single horn each, have also recently opened a dream-reading stall, and their business is booming. Are they responsible, or is their exploitative business just a red herring?

##### Down Below (high-level)

A massive sinkhole has emerged beneath the First Bastion, taking a portion of the temple into the darkness of the Underwalk Ward. With the depth seemingly bottomless, and initial investigators going missing, high priest Umentu Helmdoff seeks the assistance of brave and able-bodied adventurers to find answers and save the people still in the temple when it vanished. Only one thing is certain when descending into the unknown below—the terror only grows as the light from above fades.

### Wildwood Byway

Known as the oldest road in Tal'Dorei, this path linked the adolescent cities of "Kraghammer" and "Syngorn" before the landfall of humankind. During the reign of "Drassig", the "Silvercut Roadway" intersected with this ancient road. Warren "Drassig" built countless fortifications along this road to defend his holdings against "Syngorn", a move that made him many allies within "Kraghammer".

While traveling the Wildwood in broad daylight isn't any more dangerous than riding along the Silvercut, it's common knowledge that the forest at the northern end of this road is fraught with danger. Wild beasts, cultists, and bandits make the Wildwood their home.

## Cliffkeep Mountains

Spanning the northern reaches of Tal'Dorei, the "Cliffkeep Mountains" are an impenetrable barrier between the Republic of Tal'Dorei and the frozen "Neverfields". The southern foothills are dotted with forests and pockets of civilization, standing resolute against the unwelcoming topography. Deep within the earth itself, the dwarven stronghold of "Kraghammer" flourishes and expands, just a few scant leagues above ancient caverns that plunge into a domain of unknowable horrors.

The "Cliffkeeps" are the largest mountain range in all of Tal'Dorei, and innumerable types of beings make their homes upon the crags, in mountainside caves, and in the miles upon miles of tunnels that descend into the earth below them. "Dwarves", "half-giants", "goblins", and kobolds are the best-known peoples of the "Cliffkeeps", but the mountains are also home to the fire giants of "Vulkanon", wandering [ettins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ettin.md) and [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md), hungry [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md), [frost giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) marauders from the "Neverfields", and cave-dwelling [trolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/troll.md).

Near the earth elemental rift and "the Ashari" village of "Terrah", the mountains themselves seem to rise up in defense as [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) spring from the living stones. Northward, peaks reach higher and winds grow colder as snow and ice take the lands to become the frozen waste of the "Neverfields". These challenges keep the common folk at bay, the secrets and spoils held within these crags calling to the brave, the clever, and the foolhardy.

### Fort Daxio

Nestled within the "Othendin Pass", north of "Emon", "Fort Daxio" is a massive stronghold and series of military structures that, under the rule of the "Tal'Dorei Council", trains Tal'Dorei's most elite warriors. The fortress was constructed following the "Scattered War" as a strategic bulwark against opportunistic humanoid and giant bandit forces in the "Cliffkeep Mountains", and as a hidden reserve of military might in the event that "Emon" was ever threatened.

Though Tal'Dorei doesn't maintain a standing army—rather, it assembles one in times of strife from mercenaries, adventurers, and local militias—the forces of "Fort Daxio" are an exception. The legendary Daxio Outriders are a corps of cavaliers some four thousand strong. Half their forces remain stationed in "Fort Daxio" and its surroundings at any given time, serving as a historic barrier between "Emon" and the bandits and creatures of the "Cliffkeep Mountains". The other two thousand Outriders are spread across the continent, typically in battalions of up to one hundred riders, safeguarding villages, patrolling the "Silvercut Roadway", putting pressure on the "Ravagers" of the "Dividing Plains", or protecting traveling diplomats.

"Fort Daxio" itself is led by General Elle Gorgofon, a dour but diplomatic tactician. She served faithfully under the fort's previous leader, Warmaster Mikael Daxio, for nearly thirty-five years before he was killed at the hands of a [vampire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) hoping to throw the fort into chaos. Daxio was resurrected, but is enjoying an extended holiday in "Syngorn" rather than returning to arms.

The Daxio Outriders are divided into four different regiments: The Dusk Regiment, the Gale Regiment, the Aegis Regiment, and the Tide Regiment. Each regiment is led by their own assigned general, all answering directly to General Gorgofon (who in turn answers to the Master of War on the "Tal'Dorei Council" in times of conflict).

The Dusk Regiment is responsible for covert operations across the country and is led by General Fei Yujian, a cheerful, affable man. The Gale Regiment is trained in skyborne combat in addition to horse-riding; after the "Chroma Conclave" was defeated, "Fort Daxio" trained a variety of [griffons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md), [hippogriffs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hippogriff.md), and [wyverns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) to ward against airborne threats. It is led by General Jillian Sylph, a calm, tactical human with air "elemental ancestry". The Aegis Regiment is charged with remaining in "Fort Daxio" to protect "Emon", and is led by General Elle Gorgofon herself. The Tide Regiment is trained in spellcasting and ship-to-ship combat, in case "Emon" is ever threatened from the western seas. This final regiment is led by General Kay Clearsight, a half-elf trained in the arcane arts at the renowned Soltryce Academy in the Dwendalian Empire of "Wildemount".

##### Vampire Hunters (high-level)

Years ago, Warmaster Mikael Daxio was killed by a [vampire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) named Vrylaska Fellbranch. She disappeared without a trace, and the Daxio Outriders have been searching fruitlessly for her for years. While the characters are in "Fort Daxio", a scout returns with breathless news of vampire attacks in remote settlements in the "Cliffkeep Mountains". General Elle Gorgofon suspects a trap, but has no choice but to mobilize the Aegis Regiment—and the characters, if they accept her offer of 5,000 gp—to hunt the monster down.

Little do they know that, while the Aegis Regiment is away, the vampire's minions hidden in "Fort Daxio" will come out to play.

### Gatshadow

The mighty mountain known as "Gatshadow" is a spire of death that looms over the "Dividing Plains". "Westruun" sees it always upon the horizon, and the most vicious monsters of the "Bramblewood" grow cruel in its fell shadow. Folkloric tales about the evil powers within "Gatshadow" are told in all cultures of the "Dividing Plains": stories of [giant spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) in the forest, of beings of pure shadow that dwell within the mountain's tunnels, and of the tunnels themselves, which are so labyrinthine and shifting that no one who enters will ever escape. These days, most of these stories are told to keep children from wandering into the forest alone—but they are far from simply children's tales.

"Gatshadow" was transformed into a place of evil in the "Age of Arcanum". Acek Orattim, a priest of the Betrayer God known as the Chained Oblivion, made the mountain his seat of power. The Oblivion's inexorable might corrupted the mountain, stretching its stone-like putty until it was a jagged needle that towered over all other mountains, and etching a mind-bending labyrinth of twisting passages into the mountain's heart.

Acek spread the The Chained Oblivion nihilistic despair across the "Cliffkeep Mountains" and the "Dividing Plains" below. All bowed before their influence their minds lost to unfathomable contemplation of the end of all things. Untold thousands died at the hands of Acek and his god, willingly entering "Gatshadow"—which then became their tomb.

The bitter cold of oblivion threatened to consume the land, but it was repulsed by the Dawnfather and his warriors of light. The Dawnfather struck a telling blow against the Oblivion, and doggedly pursued as it retreated to "Gatshadow". He shackled and banished the god of the end within "Gatshadow's" depths. It was said that Acek's mind and spirit were so saturated with his master's essence that the god's banishment tore his body asunder. Today, only the empty maze of deadly chambers and traps remain beneath the mountain, forgotten and awaiting discovery.

The high bluffs of "Gatshadow" have in recent years been the home of many a villain, most recently Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, the black dragon of the "Chroma Conclave". Legend says that "Gatshadow's" interior tunnels spiral infinitely downwards, into a void of utter darkness. Immortal, white-eyed devotees of the Oblivion pace endlessly into "Gatshadow's" tunnels, carrying lightless torches, whispering that the secret to freeing their god from the Divine Gate is sealed in the depths below. The stone doors that bar entrance to "Gatshadow's" lowest reaches are sealed by magic so great, even the most inquisitive of the "Arcana Pansophical" can't breach them—and it is well that they cannot, for who knows what terror would be unleashed if they were opened.

##### Blood of the Dragon (high-level)

The body of the [ancient black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md) Umbrasyl was never recovered. Some think that's a waste of a perfectly good business opportunity—after all, a black dragon's bones are a potent alchemical reagent, and its scales stronger than any steel.

However, there's a reason no one has dared to recover the Hope Devourer's corpse. When Umbrasyl died, the caustic acid and magical blood within his body seeped through the caverns of Upper "Gatshadow", devouring stone and transforming the mountain's upper levels into a vitriolic maze teeming with oozes, half-black dragon warriors, and the restless spirits of "goliaths" from the Herd of Storms that failed to kill the dragon.

##### No Lights in the Darkness (epic-level)

The "Betrayer Gods" were banished to their planes of eternal imprisonment, but something has upset the laws of the planes. A being called the Nameless—supposedly a cultist of The Whispered One—has stolen her master's secret knowledge and fled to "Gatshadow" in search of the tortured spirit of Acek Orattim. Agents of the "Arcana Pansophical" have sensed that the lower gates of "Gatshadow" have been breached, and frantically call for Tal'Dorei's greatest heroes to rush to the evil mountain. As the characters hurry to the bottom of the mind-sundering labyrinth within, they discover that they race against not only the new Herald of Oblivion, but also the "Remnants" she betrayed.

### Jorenn Village

- **Large Village.** Population 2,480 (64% "humans", 9% "dwarves", 7% "halflings", 7% "gnomes", 13% "other races")  

For many years, Jorenn Village was just a tiny pioneer town trying to profit from the shadegrass of the "Umbra Hills". Over the past century, the village has exploded in size and population, after plentiful silver veins were discovered within the nearby rocky hills.

Hardworking common folk and opportunistic prospectors alike flocked to Jorenn, despite its unsettling proximity to the "Umbra Hills". Jorenn is far enough away from "Emon" that the influence of the "Tal'Dorei Council" rarely touches it, giving opportunists and outlaws freedom to subvert and control both the village government and the local economy. Thirty years ago, a small circle of vigilantes and mercenaries declared themselves protectors of Jorenn, and took the name Shadewatch, hunting and slaying creeping dangers in the night and returning to great fanfare. Over the past three decades, others seeking fame and glory joined the ranks of the Shadewatch, and the group ballooned into the unofficial town law enforcement.

The Shadewatch is deeply corrupt, and it has been almost since its first year. The vigilantes personally stoke the fires of fear, all while demanding increasingly galling tribute for their services—and breaking kneecaps if they don't get it. Today, the people of Jorenn are just as afraid of the Shadewatch as they are of the creatures the watch keeps at bay.

The Shadewatch is a minor organization in the grand scheme of things, but Shademaster Arhanna Lewyn has grand ambitions. She has sent messages to every faction in Tal'Dorei, from the "Myriad" to the "League of Miracles", with an interest in cruel subterfuge. It's clear that she's planning something: every night, she consults a ball of polished white quartz, and every week she sends a trio of her agents to the "Umbra Hills"—or to the base of "Gatshadow".

##### An Offer You Can't Refuse (low-level)

The characters are attacked by a group of [worgs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md), and more just keep coming. Just as they're about to be completely overwhelmed, they're saved by a sudden volley of black-feathered bolts! Six thugs join the battle and "rescue" the characters by driving off the remaining [worgs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md). These Shadewatch "officers" ask for the characters' names first, then brusquely declare that they like their moxie. They offer the characters a position in their force back in Jorenn, with unbelievable pay: 50 gp a day each.

If this deal sounds too good to be true, that's because it is: the Shademaster needs strong-willed sacrifices if she's to open the gates of "Gatshadow", a feat she can accomplish by teleporting up to twelve creatures into the depths of the mountain with her whispering quartz orb.

### Kraghammer

- **City.** Population 73,550 (73% "dwarves", 8% "gnomes", 5% "humans", 14% "other races")  

Dozens of dwarven redoubts rose and fell in the tunnels beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains" during the "Calamity", and in the uncertain years that followed it. Legend holds that a great civilization called Uthtor once reigned supreme in the "Cliffkeeps", and that all of the deep settlements are fragments of Uthtor's glory, fractured by the "Calamity". Over the centuries, these fragments divided and coalesced dozens of times until, finally, those who remained came together to create Kraghammer.

Clan Jaggenstrike united thousands of "dwarves", "gnomes", and other dwellers of the deep halls in the creation of Kraghammer. Having quietly died out centuries ago, the clan now holds a position of mythic reverence within the city. Kraghammer's founding was dedicated to the All-Hammer, divine creator of the "dwarves" and patron of creation and ingenuity. This god's industrious spirit filled the people of Kraghammer and blessed them with rich veins of [platinum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/platinum.md), mithral, adamantine, and other precious metals that have sustained them since the city's founding.

An ominous walk of a thousand stairs climbs the side of the mountain to the gates of the city—carved from the mountain itself, just wide enough for two "dwarves" to walk abreast. With the path too steep and treacherous for carts or common beasts of burden to traverse, traders and trappers use [giant goats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat.md) to transport their goods to and from market, while wealthy dwarven merchant lords employ serfs and laborers to carry their goods. Kraghammer's impenetrable adamantine gates stand at the end of a perilous bridge overlooking a hundred-foot chasm, guarded by three watchtowers carved directly into the mountain.

Within those gates, the massive stronghold is made up of three cylindrical levels called "slabs" that descend deep beneath the mountains. Kraghammer's granite walls are lit by roaring fires, enchanted torches, and shimmering candlerock, which glows with internal fire. Even when the evening fires are extinguished, the amber light of the Bronzegrip Metalworks at the base of the city bathes Kraghammer in its warm glow.

#### Government

"Kraghammer" law is written by a consortium of the five most powerful houses within the city, each appointing a delegate to serve on their behalf. That tenuous union of houses is kept by the city's executive officer, the Ironkeeper. The Ironkeeper is elected by the houses and carries a term of ten years, with no term limit, though most Ironkeepers contain their rule to three to five terms.

The current sitting Ironkeeper is "Palluda of House Zuurthom". She rose to prominence advocating for the rights of workers in the wake of the "Chroma Conclave", and is a strong advocate for uniting with the Republic of Tal'Dorei to strengthen their might against future supernatural threats. She is sitting comfortably in the midst of her second term and enjoys strong support from members of "Kraghammer's" working class—and staunch opposition from traditionalists, who cling to the city's fading culture of "isolationism".

The laws of the city are enforced by a military class of elite warriors called Carvers that act as guards, soldiers, and jailers under the guidance of the Ironkeeper. Becoming a Carver is a lengthy, rigorous, and taxing pursuit, and many who choose to join fail to complete their training.

Most who join the Carvers are "dwarves" from families with centuries of history within the Carvers. This isn't just because of the pressure to uphold their family's honor. Most hopefuls are also those who value "Kraghammer's" ancient traditions and rigid social order—a set of beliefs largely held by dwarven clans with long family histories. Once officially named, a Carver is given a homestead built into the center slab of the city, a set of immaculate armor and weapons, and a steady income.

In the years following the defeat of the "Chroma Conclave", the famously "isolationist" and xenophobic houses conceded to formally make an alliance with the Republic of Tal'Dorei. An ambassador from "Kraghammer" now sits on the "Tal'Dorei Council", and rumors are beginning to circulate within the city that the heads of the Great "Houses of Kraghammer" are in talks with the "Tal'Dorei Council" to make "Kraghammer" an official constituent city-state of the republic.

![A cross-sectioned map of K...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-kraghammermap.webp#center "A cross-sectioned map of Kraghammer showing the underground network of dwarfish tunnels beneath the mountain. On top is The Arch, the middle is The Heart, the bottom is The Pit, with Keenstone Quarry below that. Much further down are the Emberhold and Yug'voril.")

#### Isolation of Kraghammer

It's not easy being an outsider. "Kraghammer" has long been a city of "dwarves", for "dwarves", and anyone else within the city is an interloper. Some traditionalists within the city still think that surface-born folk should spend as little time in "Kraghammer" as possible, so as not to dilute the ancient splendor of their culture.

Yet times are changing. A coalition of people, ranging from "dwarves" to "gnomes" to traditionally surface-dwelling people who have made "Kraghammer" their home, have demanded that the Great Houses amend the city's most xenophobic laws. Despite the angry protestations of the city's most bigoted "dwarves", the Great Houses have acquiesced to the requests of their people. This is due in no small part to these protestors having the support of the current Ironkeeper—"Palluda Zuurthrom" has long been a proponent of "Kraghammer" entering the Republic of Tal'Dorei and ending their centuries of relative isolation.

No non-dwarf has ever served as a delegate of the houses, let alone the Ironkeeper. Progress is slow, especially in "Kraghammer", but it is happening. The most despicable of the city's xenophobes have left of their own volition, creating other dwarven settlements throughout the "Cliffkeeps" where they can keep to themselves and "their own kind" in peace.

#### Crime

Citizens of "Emon" who visit "Kraghammer" often marvel at how lawful and organized the dwarven enclave is. Crime is ostensibly low within "Kraghammer" thanks to the Carvers' protection, but this peace comes at a cost. Crime is low because the courts of "Kraghammer" almost always reach a guilty verdict. As a long-lived and durable people, most "dwarves", particularly those with a family reputation to uphold, would rather plead guilty and endure years, even decades, of hard labor than disturb the fabric of their society by fighting conviction.

Beyond this, corruption is rife within the Carvers, and they are able to brutalize even innocent people with relative impunity. This corruption is shielded from public scrutiny by the vast wealth and political influence of House Glorendar, their patron house. Because of Glorendar's close ties with the Carvers (and the mutual benefits thereof), corruption has been hard to uncover within either organization.

Over twenty years ago, however, a gnomish journalist named Ida Mudrake uncovered something damning within the vaults of House Glorendar, bringing some hope that change may yet move steadily forward. She has been forced to flee the city and now lives with a security detail in "Emon", but she works tirelessly to bring the crimes of House Glorendar to light. Many in "Kraghammer" hope that this evidence, whatever it is, will shake both Glorendar and the Carvers to their foundations. Many more fear that even true justice is not worth the chaos that bringing Glorendar's misdeeds to light will cause.

#### Geography and Climate

Though the "Cliffkeep Mountains" themselves are blanketed in thick snow, the bone-piercing chill does not extend into "Kraghammer" itself. Heat from the Bronzegrip Metalworks and the other blast furnaces in the Bottom Slab rises and permeates the entire city, though the Top Slab still grows cold in the winter. The city itself is carved out of the granite core of Mount "Kraghammer"; though the "dwarves" rarely see the night sky, the inner walls still sparkle like starlight in the amber glow of the furnaces.

##### Top Slab

Also called the Arch, this uppermost tier is the entry level of the city, built on a massive ring. Like a hub with many spokes, countless neighborhoods and tunnels spread out from the Top Slab. A fine layer of soot tends to coat much of this slab, due to imperfect ventilation from the industrious center slab; despite this, this level is where most people make their homes, with thousands of stone-built abodes dotting the walls, while popular taverns like the trendy Firebrook Inn and the historic but austere Ironhearth Tavern fill alcoves pushed into the rock. For hundreds of years, most non-dwarves within "Kraghammer" were relegated to living in a Top Slab neighborhood called the "Otherwalk." These days, non-dwarves live all over the city, and the Otherwalk has been renamed the Cavernwalk. It's still mostly inhabited by non-dwarves, and it has a vibrant culture all its own.

As members of the "Kraghammer" working class, "Topslabbers" either make the long commute to labor in the Bottom Slab or work in the Toppers' farms above the mountain. Others are indentured servants to wealthy "dwarves" in the Middle Slab, and only return to their families on the Top Slab on their monthly day of rest.

##### Center Slab

Also referred to as the Heart, this middle tier is the widest and most varied rung on the journey through "Kraghammer". It is stratified between the residences of "Kraghammer's" old money (its long-established noble houses), and the new (the wealthy merchant class). At the exact center of the slab is the Pyrethrone, seat of the Ironkeeper. The geometric symbolism of the Pyrethrone being at the dead center of the city is a fact most visitors to "Kraghammer" hear ad nauseum. Radiating out from the Pyrethrone are the various fortress-manors of the dwarven noble houses, with several Carver barracks in easy reach.

Below, the outer rings of the Center Slab are occupied by most of the city's non-mining businesses, from smithies, breweries, and jewelers, to tailors, butchers, and tinkerers like the "Cracksackle Union". The Hunter's Club is also well known as the chief provider for non-imported meats to the city, sending parties into the mountains or the nearby "Torian Forest" for wild game. The extravagant marble temple known as All-Hammer's Will stands on the center slab of the city, the grandest of all shrines to the most worshipped deity under the mountain. Enormous in size and impeccable in both detail and architectural design, this hall calls to artisans and crafters throughout the city for inspiration.

Of the five noble houses, only two conduct their affairs entirely in the Center Slab. The magically talented Lord Steddos Thunderbrand and his family are known to rarely leave their mansion, except on business with the Ironkeeper. Wallera Glorendar used to oversee the combat training of all Carvers within "Kraghammer", but hasn't been seen in public for twenty years. Her daughter, Kazya, runs all her affairs within the public eye.

##### Bottom Slab

Best known as the Pit, this tier is the industrious powerhouse of "Kraghammer", boasting the most forges per square mile of any location in Tal'Dorei, courtesy of the Bronzegrip Metalworks and their competitors. Most of these forges are potent, highly industrialized, and mechanized blast furnaces. The expansive "Keenstone Quarry" is chief among the numerous mining operations that have tunneled through the depths of the mountains—depths whose true dangers are obscured by centuries of legend, and therefore not fully understood.

A network of fungus-farming paths called the Glowgrove works its way around this level, passing through all sorts of caverns. The mushrooms are harvested by the Toppers, the dwarven agricultural league that got their name from the small topside farms they tend above the city.

Three of the five dwarven houses have business interests in the Bottom Slab, though they direct its operations from the next tier up. "Nostoc Greyspine" is the grim overseer of "Keenstone Quarry". Haddi Bronzegrip is the foredwarf of the Bronzegrip Metalworks; she claims to be the wealthiest dwarf in the North, a claim no one has ever been able to successfully dispute. Blenton Zuurthom is an architectural savant, and one of the older and kinder noble "dwarves"; he tries his best to oversee every major construction project in the Bottom Slab.

The glow of flames emanate from four faces carved into the designs of the forge and several vents.")

#### Points of Interest

"Kraghammer" has a number of famous landmarks, as well as a few mythic locations said to exist in the caverns beneath the city, as depicted on its map.

##### The Starshrine (Top Slab)

Most "dwarves" worship the All-Hammer, and his teachings of community and ancestral piety have been all but completely subsumed into "Kraghammer's" culture at large. For outlanders with different faiths, however, the monolithic religious culture can feel inescapable. Shrines to all the "Prime Deities" have spread throughout "Kraghammer" since the fall of the "Chroma Conclave", but the Starshrine was the first.

When the world trembled at the might of "Thordak the Cinder King", tremors rocked the upper layers of "Kraghammer", causing certain caverns to collapse—and in some cases, to reveal places of great beauty. The Starshrine is a vast grotto whose granite walls mysteriously sparkle with a perfect replica of the stars in the night sky. It can be found within the Top Slab's culturally diverse Cavernwalk district. Once per year, when a character prays to one of the "Prime Deities" here, there is a 1% chance chance per character level that their prayer is answered, as the cleric's [Divine Intervention](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md#Divine%20Intervention%20(Level%2010)) class feature.

##### Cracksackle Guildhall (Middle Slab)

The headquarters of the Cracksackle Union looks unlike anything in "Kraghammer". It's made of a dozen glistening steel domes, like sleek, metal igloos, and the light of unusual experiments flicker through its slitted windows at all hours of the night. Most within "Kraghammer" consider the building an eyesore, but all interested in technological tinkering and ingenuity love it for its uniqueness. If nothing else, it plainly displays the oft-baffling ingenuity of its tinkerers.

The Cracksackle Union was founded by gnomish refugees from "Wittebak" nearly four hundred years ago. While intrinsically tied to the Bronzegrip Metalworks for resources, contacts, and distribution, the Cracksacklers have made themselves indispensable to the dwarven elite with their inventive contributions to mining and masonry technology.

On any working day, a dozen tinkerers, many of them "gnomes", will set up shop in the courtyard, selling strange and untested devices they have made in their workshops. The GM determines which non-magical curiosities can be purchased here, but some include:

![Cracksackle Guildhall (Middle Slab); Cracksackle Wares](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/cracksackle-guildhall-middle-slab-cracksackle-wares-tdcsr.md)

##### Keenstone Quarry (Bottom Slab)

Despite all of "Kraghammer's" wondrous crafts and goods, its most significant export is raw stone—most of which is excavated from Keenstone Quarry, making the quarry's overseer, "Nostoc Greyspine", a very rich dwarf indeed. As the legend of Vox Machina spread across Tal'Dorei, "Overseer Greyspine" got an idea: open the quarry to adventurers. Vox Machina famously entered the vast network of dangerous tunnels beneath "Kraghammer" from a fissure at the depths of the quarry, and countless imitators have tried to follow in their footsteps—some emerging with fabulous treasure, but most never returning at all.

To take advantage of this opportunity, "Greyspine" has advertised the quarry far and wide as the "Gateway to the Depths," and posted an entrance fee of 25 gp per adventurer. Of course, neither "Greyspine" nor the staff of the quarry bears any liability for death, dismemberment, or emotional trauma sustained with the depths.

##### Hall of Burning Mushrooms

The Bronzegrip Metalworks just carved deeper into the mountain to expand their furnaces, only to discover the most magnificent cavern: a mile-wide cave filled with bioluminescent purple mushrooms. Industry had to move in, and the Bronzegrips hired Wyrmhide Thunderbrand and his pyromancer brigade to torch the cavern. The mushrooms never stopped burning, and the [myconids](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/myconid-adult.md) that lived in the fungal forest never stopped fighting. Characters known within "Kraghammer" may be requested by House Bronzegrip or Thunderbrand to cut through the inferno and destroy the [myconid monarch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/myconid-sovereign.md).

### Emberhold

- **City.** Population 21,180 (73% "dwarves", 15% "elves", 12% "other races")  

A passage from the "Keenstone Quarry" in "Kraghammer" leads below the earth. Deep. Deeper. Until the light of day is entirely gone, and then deeper still. Across chasms miles-deep and full of magma, beneath great hanging gardens of glowing [malachite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/malachite.md), lies the "Emberhold". It stares imperiously over an underground kingdom of the [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md), "dwarves" who long ago broke away from the rule of the Great "Houses of Kraghammer".

Millennia of fear and superstition have turned the "dwarves" of "Kraghammer" into bitter, fearful enemies of their estranged kin. Untold dozens of duergar villages span the glassy lava-plains that the "Emberhold" is built upon, with mighty armies constantly coming and going, sometimes returning with just a few bloody survivors, other times returning with captives in chains—and other times returning not at all.

The "dwarves" of the "Emberhold" rarely rise to the surface; they have lived so long in the darkest depths of the earth that the light of the sun sears their eyes and prickles their skin. Few ever arise even to "Kraghammer", for they are taught that only death awaits them there. Nevertheless, many duergar doubt the narrative that has been fed to them since birth, and make attempts to escape to the surface. Those duergar that have left the ways of the "Emberhold" behind and learned of the outside world have remarked how unbelievable it is that their people were so misled by lies about the barbaric cruelty of surface-dwellers.

#### Government

The "Emberhold" and the towns that serve as its vassals are ruled by an absolute monarch. The current King of Embers is the wrathful King Thangrul II. He rules through fear and conquest, spreading his armies to the farthest corners of Tal'Dorei's underground caverns in the name of the Crawling King.

Thangrul's rule is supported by a contingent of [dark elves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md) from their decadent, alien domain of "Ruhn-Shak". Most in Thangrul's court know well enough to mistrust these ambassadors of the far-flung caverns, for their minds have been twisted by the influence of not just the Spider Queen, but also the aberrations with whom they have made strange alliances in order to sustain their power. Thangrul himself cares little for his advisors' mistrust of his elven allies and openly declares that he will make use of them as long as they are useful.

Vox Machina's assault of the "Emberhold" over twenty years ago cost the duergar their king and queen, but rumors of a lost princess of Ember have begun to circulate through the realm, and the survivors of Vox Machina's raid have rebuilt their hierarchy and continued their endless war of conquest throughout the depths.

#### Geography

The "Emberhold" itself is a fortress built of black stone and [obsidian](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/obsidian.md), framed by rivers of molten rock and surrounded by a massive city of ramshackle dwellings and towers that mark the boundaries of its peoples' domain.

#### Emberhold Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Emberhold" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### The Lost Heir (mid-level)

King Murghol of the "Emberhold" was killed in combat by [Scanlan Shorthalt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/scanlan-shorthalt-tdcsr.md), gnome bard of Vox Machina, and his wife, Queen Ulara, was slain by the aberrant tyrant K'Varn. All of the "Emberhold" knows that the King and Queen had a young daughter—only six years old at the time of their death—but none seem interested in seeking "Emberhold's" missing heir. The new king, Thangrul II, grows particularly fiery whenever anyone mentions her name in his presence.

### Yug'Voril

Where the "dwarves" of "Kraghammer" whisper fearful words of the [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md), so too do the [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) whisper of Yug'Voril. Beneath the deep "dwarves'" fiery kingdom, ever deeper into the heart of Exandria, there is a miles-wide grotto coated in glowing crystal. A lake fills the grotto, its surface so smooth and placid it seems like a [jade](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jade.md) mirror, perfectly reflecting the light of the crystals around it. In the middle of the lake is an island, atop which loom the grand, austere towers of Yug'Voril.

The clean lines and beautiful facade of the city belie its current, abominable denizens.

Thousands of years old, the builders and previous occupants have long vanished, leaving the unspoiled ruins to become home to a host of [psychic, mind-eating creatures](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) from a plane beyond the boundaries of reality. The tyrannical society of these alien creatures flourishes here, far from their cosmic pursuers, giving them the freedom to build a legion of thralls: mind-slaves whose delicious brains are allowed to remain in their bodies...until those bodies fall apart from toil.

Yug'Voril and [its inhabitants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) fell recently under the control of the extraplanar aberration called K'Varn, before he was slain by Vox Machina. Now that the [alien mind-eaters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) have been freed from K'Varn's tyranny, they have reclaimed Yug'Voril as their own and have continued work on their strange and terrible plots.

#### Yug'Voril Adventures

##### A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste (high-level)

Four of the foremost minds at "Emon's" "Alabaster Lyceum" have disappeared without a trace. All vanished on the same night, and there have been no confirmed sightings since. Investigations have been underway for several months, and some "dwarves" of "Kraghammer" have recently reported seeing four figures that could be the missing scholars entering the lower passages of the "Keenstone Mine" under cover of night.

Something has mentally dominated these scholars. The alien inhabitants of "Yug'Voril" hunger for a specific morsel of powerful knowledge within their brilliant minds.

### Lyrengorn, the Elvenpeaks

- **Town.** Population 5,430 (93% "elves", 3% "dwarves", 2% "humans", 2% "other races")  

Every year, dozens of travelers from across Tal'Dorei travel past the far northern reaches of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" to see the Moonweaver's Ribbons twist around the Elvenpeaks, pulled through the sky by those mysterious figures on [wyvernback](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md). The Elvenpeaks are a single mountain split perfectly in the center, with ice-sheeted forests topping both peaks. While the exterior of these forest canopies appears frozen and without life, the interior is instead a warm and humid wood, blooming with flowers of all colors and roamed by living plants and wild game. In the boughs of these thick tropical trees also lives a society of wood "elves", some of those wild folk who broke away from Yenlara's pact and the city of "Syngorn". Their city of Lyrengorn—*lyren'gorn* literally meaning "mountain city" in Elvish—is the last bastion of safety before crossing into the endless ice of the "Neverfields" to the north.

These lyren'alfen—"high "elves""—call themselves friends of none and enemies of fewer; they welcome all who manage to make it to their home, provided they come in peace, and take no sides in any conflict. In ages past, they were highly sought-after as mercenaries because their warriors had learned the rare art of [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) riding. When Warren "Drassig's" legions marched to conquer Tal'Dorei, the "elves" of Lyrengorn refused to die for anyone else's war, retreating instead to their mountaintops and lush forests.

Today, few of the lyren'alfen are actually warriors, though many among them are hunters. In the intervening centuries, [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) riding has transformed from a martial art into a ceremonial one; great athletes called skyswimmers train year-round for the annual coming of the Moonweaver's Ribbons, great streaks of multicolored light that illuminate the northern sky on the winter solstice. The skyswimmers and their [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) mounts seize the strands of light on their spears and paint radiant, esoteric portraits in the wintry sky, drawing intrepid outsiders from across Tal'Dorei to camp on remote mountains and marvel at their visual poetry.

Beyond the ceremony's artistic merit, it's also a ritual to the goddess known as the Moonweaver, chief deity of these "elves". The high priestess of the moon claims that the annual rite purifies Lyrengorn and gives the wild "elves" long life.

![A jagged, icy mountain pea...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-moonweaverribbons.webp#center "A jagged, icy mountain peak looms over a barren, frozen valley as a beautiful, glowing borealis of purple, blue and green twists around itself. In the foreground, a figure in shadow rides a wyvern, twisting the borealis behind them like playing with ribbon.")

##### The Impossible Art (low-level)

While traveling through the "Cliffkeep Mountains", the cold becomes too much for the characters to bear, and they pass out in the snow. When they awaken, they find themselves being tended to by a trio of Lyrengorn [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) riders, but their roles are suddenly reversed when a massive band of raiders, most of them [goblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and human thugs, pincushions the riders in mid-flight. When the characters crash in the snowfields, they find their saviors dead, and must try to learn the impossible art of [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) riding before they are claimed by the blizzard.

##### The Incorruptible Light (high-level)

While the characters are in Lyrengorn, they discover a small community of dark elf refugees. They fled here from a monstrous, nameless source of aberrant corruption that has been devouring their society for centuries. The dark "elves" hope that the skyswimmers' ceremony will cleanse them of the corruption and fits of sadistic cruelty that still plague them from their days under the abberrations' terrible thrall. Strange accidents conspire to kill the skyswimmers and the priestesses, and on the day of the solstice, a pair of [many-eyed aberrations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) rise from the depths of the earth and try to bend the Moonweaver's Ribbons to their evil purposes.

### The Neverfields

The farther north one goes into the "Cliffkeep Mountains", the taller the peaks grow and the colder the weather becomes, until the snowstorms are so thick that no human unprepared for their chill can survive. The spiky peaks grow shallow, trading treacherous rock for glacial ice and the untempered fury of endless blizzards. No bastions of living society exist this far north, though some brave, foolish warriors endure the elements here to hunt rare and powerful game or to seek lost relics from before the "Calamity".

Legends tell of a time when this region was green and temperate, when trees and joyous elven enclaves covered the land. Moreover, these tales say that relics of this elysian era are still buried deep beneath the icy wastes. Many that go seeking answers to these rumors never return. The few that do, however, occasionally emerge with artifacts of intense power and mystery, reigniting interest in the region and sending further generations to their doom among the ancient, ice-rimed ruins and plains of endless glacial wasteland.

#### Neverfields Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Neverfields" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Seed of Life (mid-level)

Heroes of Tal'Dorei who have made themselves known to "Syngorn" may suddenly find themselves contacted by "Verdant Lord Celindar", leader of "Syngorn's" armies. His report is grim: the warding trees of the "Verdant Expanse" no longer protect the city; in fact, some have turned against it. The [treants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md) that once defended the "elves" have grown pale and sickly, and are now attacking the elvenguard. "Celindar" beseeches the characters to meet with his counterpart in Lyrengorn, Skyblade Hali Instralidar, who has been surveying the ice fields of the north for centuries. Why? Because elven legend speaks of the Seed of Life, the last bloom of an ancient [treant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md) named Cedargaunt, which may restore the withered treants' senses. The Seed of Life is worn on the neck of a [frost giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) jarl's pet [remorhaz](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md) within the "Neverfields".

### Othendin Pass

This massive valley carved into the southwest section of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" was, in ancient times, the territory of [stone giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) clans that warred with the "dwarves" of "Kraghammer". After the arrival of humanity on Tal'Dorei's shores, the people of "Kraghammer" and the new settlers of "O'Noa" banded together and pushed deep into the mineral-rich valley.

The [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) fought back, but they were overwhelmed by the might of their combined foe. They retreated to their caves higher into the mountains to the northeast, and have rarely been seen by humanoids in the centuries since. This allowed the forces of "Emon" to claim the resources and land of the Othendin Pass for its people, establishing "Fort Daxio" to defend it.

However, the population of deadly landsharks—creatures called [bulettes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md)—native to the region has been on the rise. Some say it's because the giants who hunted them were driven away, but since the giants have been gone for a century, few can understand why the landsharks are only taking over now. The miners, gatherers, and passing travelers do their best to cull the [bulette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) population both on their own and with the help of hired adventurers, but they can only ever hope to keep the deadly monsters at bay.

#### Othendin Pass Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Othendin Pass" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Bite the Bulette (mid-level)

A druidic order called the Stoneherders, made up mostly of [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) and "goliaths", have taken up residence in an important choke point of the "Othendin Pass". They claim that they are the Stoneherders, a great druidic order that keeps the balance between civilization and nature in the north. "Fort Daxio's" military presence in the pass has kept them away for several generations, but an unusual rise in the [bulette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) population has forced them to return.

The Stoneherders' plan to thin the [bulette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) herd requires the characters' aid in rounding up the deadly creatures; once they have been assembled, the Stoneherders will tame as many as they can and move them elsewhere in the "Cliffkeep Mountains". Those that can't be tamed will be relocated to other parts of the mountains, where they can be hunted again.

### Palace of Wonder

In the desolate and uninhabited northwestern reaches of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" stands a ruined citadel. All that remains of it are crumbling walls, half-beaten to dust by the unrelenting winds of the mountains, and one forlorn tower, its turret torn asunder to reveal the mildewed, rain-fattened wooden beams within. This ruin, a relic of the early days of "Issylran" settlement and a panoply of forgotten wars, is all but forgotten by the people of Tal'Dorei. Few explorers travel these wind-scarred peaks, or the storm-beaten northwestern coast of Tal'Dorei. The citadel itself is wracked by the elements, while the shoreline and the mountains beyond it are prowled by territorial elementals that brook no intrusions.

#### Secrets of the Citadel

The ruined citadel that overlooks this treacherous landscape is far more than meets the eye. In truth, it is the headquarters of the "League of Miracles". The power-hungry spellwrights who make up the league's upper echelons call this castle the Palace of Wonder. A crumbling but entirely illusory edifice has replaced the derelict fortress, maintained by the league to deter curiosity and avoid notice.

Beneath this arcane façade, the Palace of Wonder truly lives up to its name. The palace is made up of five wings, each of which has a dedicated [teleportation circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md):

##### Halls of Splendor

The "League of Miracles" is in the business of good first impressions. Though the Palace of Wonder is a secret to the people of Tal'Dorei, the spellwrights occasionally teleport particularly powerful mercenary mages to their home base in order to dazzle them with the castle's splendors. The palace's ground floor is made of a number of interconnected grand halls, awash in a tide of splendid, vibrant colors—bordering on garish—that crashes over all who enter.

These many grand dining, entertaining, and performance halls are gleaming spectacles of white marble, decorated by sparkling globes of magical light, and festooned with self-indulgent tapestries of the spellwrights' many dubious achievements. Any intruders here without the express permission of at least one spellwright will find themselves beset by a small army of [animated armors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) and other constructs—including a [platinum golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/platinum-golem-tdcsr.md) that watches over the front entrance.

##### Bowers of Recovery

The second floor of the palace is a verdant paradise, with vibrant plants curling around the castle's stately stone architecture. Most spellwrights have their quarters in this wing, which is protected by powerful enchantments that give life to the plants. All who enter here without a spellwright escort are viewed by the living plants as a tasty snack.

This wing of the palace also includes a three-tiered conference chamber where all twenty-four spellwrights can gather to discuss matters of import. In the center of the chamber is a pedestal, upon which sits a humanoid mask of gleaming mithral. When the "Wonderworker", the league's mysterious leader, wishes to deliver a proclamation to the spellwrights, their voice emanates from this mask.

##### Towers of Farsight

The pinnacle of the palace is made up of four sky-scraping towers that gaze out over the "Cliffkeep Mountains"—and all of Exandria. These private studies are the personal quarters of four of the league's chief spellwrights, and they are equipped with all manner of [scrying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) crystals and tools of clairvoyance, clairaudience, and far-speech.

##### Dungeons of Despair

Woe betide the prisoners of the "League of Miracles", who are left to rot in the cells beneath their palace. The warden of this dungeon is an infallible [mage hunter golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/mage-hunter-golem-tdcsr.md), and each cell is equipped with shackles that inhibit the spellcasting capabilities of anyone in their grasp. Instruments of unspeakable arcane torture litter these dungeons, capable of instilling endless pain, and even extracting the very soul from one's body. The shackled spirits of those who have died by this last vile torment serve eternally as the guardians of the palace dungeons.

##### Cradle of the Adranach

Winding about the palace dungeons are a network of twisting passages illuminated by glaring, magical lights. These forking tunnels shift daily, and the secret to navigating them is a mark visible only under the power of a [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md) spell. Within these passages are a dozen laboratories stocked with the tools needed for the spellwrights to dream up new potions and spells. Some they sell at extravagant cost to the governments and militias of towns and cities across Tal'Dorei—but the best they keep for themselves, to wield against the factions they manipulate from the shadows, should they ever grow unruly.

At the deepest point of the tunnels is the Cradle of the Adranach, a unique arcane laboratory where all spellwrights are initiated. Here, they craft an [adranach](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/adranach-tdcsr.md), a construct of mithral and astral energy that serves as a loyal servant—and that unmistakably marks its creator as a spellwright of the "League of Miracles".

#### Gathering the Spellwrights

The "Palace of Wonder" is almost never empty, for at least one of its twenty-four spellwrights must always remain within its walls to protect it. Many more spellwrights frequently return by means of the palace's [teleportation circles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md), or upon the back of their personal [adranachs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/adranach-tdcsr.md), to take advantage of its magical equipment and nigh-impenetrable defenses.

At times, all spellwrights are requested to return to the palace at the behest of one of the four chief spellwrights, but unless one's presence is demanded by name, these summons are not mandatory. The one summon which cannot be refused, however, is the annual calling of the "Wonderworker". The nameless, faceless leader of the "League of Miracles" holds a near-prophetic sway over the spellwrights that cannot be understated. When all twenty-four spellwrights are gathered within the conference chamber, the "Wonderworker" intones a slew of cryptic yet unquestionable commandments that all of their followers must interpret and obey to the best of their ability.

### Pools of Wittebak

Wittebak was once a peaceful city of three thousand or more rock "gnomes", a safe haven for the small ones that was built into the mountain rock and heated by a series of geothermal pools. The Wittebak "gnomes" weathered great wars by not getting involved, investing in contraptions and laughter rather than wars and empires. They found joy in inventing complicated ways to simplify their daily lives. Yet, for all their efforts, trouble eventually came to them.

Around four hundred years ago, a displaced band of [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) found and luxuriated within Wittebak's hot springs and made a homestead on their banks. It is said that Wittebak was founded underneath the full light of Ruidus, for by pure misfortune, a flaw in the stonework of the gnomish city cracked under the force of the giants frolicking within the pools. Worse still, the cave-in did more than simply crush a few buildings beneath. The seismic force of thousands of tons of rock collapsed into the caverns, cracking open buried pockets of volcanic gas.

Over a thousand "gnomes" suffocated that night, or were incinerated in isolated gas explosions. The survivors fled into the mountains, assailed by hungry giants as they ran. The "gnomes" have found unlikely refuge in "Kraghammer", but Wittebak has been abandoned entirely, choked by caustic gas and locked in a terrible moment in time. The ten-times great-grandchildren of the giants that caused the "gnomes" to flee now call the hot springs their ancestral home. To them, it is named Gundergrunch, and they flourish within their unchallenged territory.

Beneath them, the ruins of Wittebak are stratified into three distinct tiers of death and despair.

#### Tinkerer's Tier

This level is relatively unharmed, and the full glory of "Wittebak's" tinkering shops can be seen here; some even include marvels of technology unseen for centuries. Creatures that need to breathe can survive the gases in the widest, uppermost level for a number of hours equal to their Constitution modifier, and take 3 (`1d6`) poison damage each minute after that time. The [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) that live within have adapted to the gas and do not fear it.

#### Homesteads

The air in the middle level is heavy with gas, and the quaint gnomish homes on this level are filled with the decomposed remains of those too slow to escape. The entire area is lightly obscured with clouds of gas, and tiny streams of hot water leak from the walls, tumbling into the level below.

#### Engine Core

The bottommost tier is a mechanical marvel, a titanic wheel of rusted iron and shining steel with no known purpose. This level is completely flooded and filled with merrow. It is also the lair of a [sea hag](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) named Mauvlettir.

#### Pools of Wittebak Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Wittebak" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Getting into Gundergrunch (mid-level)

Just getting into "Wittebak" is an adventure unto itself. It's nearly impossible to fight through the hundreds of [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) in the hot springs and the Tinkerer's Tier—and even if it weren't, such a fight would be a callous slaughter of countless innocents. Stealth is an option, for the giants take little heed of folk smaller than them. Diplomacy is another option; Gondalorr, prince of the giants, has a tender heart and loves the idea of repatriating "Wittebak's" "gnomes". His sister Gondabrau, on the other hand, is cruel, and would like nothing more than to pop wriggling "gnomes" into her mouth as a snack. Cunning adventurers could sneak in with Gondalorr's aid, or even cause chaos in the giant town by playing the siblings against each other.

##### The Truth of the Disaster (mid-level)

Was it truly just by chance that "Wittebak" was destroyed? Perhaps there is truth to the rumors that Ruidus, the Moon of Ill Omen, shone brightly above "Wittebak" on the night of its founding. The [merrow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) that lurk in the Engine Core know nothing, but the [sea hag](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) who lairs there has an inkling. Delve deeper, and the [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) and its aberrant servitors know more still—a secret that dates back to the "Founding" itself.

### Reaching Bluff

- **Village.** Population 324 (53% "humans", 27% "dwarves", 3% dark "elves", 3% earth "elemental ancestry", 14% "other races")  

In a small, fertile valley in the northwest of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" is a small village founded by Tal'Dorei homesteaders just ten years ago. This simple settlement is inhabited by hardy folk seeking new places to mine [gold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gold.md) and [iron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iron.md) from the earth. Many unpleasant exiles from "Kraghammer" have joined them, so while this village has a charming, rustic atmosphere, few travelers stay for long. The hostility toward outsiders is palpable to all.

This insular attitude has only grown more hostile following the discovery of a gleaming dodecahedron about the size of a human head. One of the miners who unearthed it found that her pickaxe barely scratched its surface—and when struck, it began emanating a radiant, internal golden glow. This mystical object was returned to the village foredwarf, and before the day was out, all the villagers had learned of it. The people of Reaching Bluff call it the The Lost Beacon of Unknown Light, and worship it as a god.

The settlers protect their mysterious beacon with cultish fervor, and Foredwarf Daz, a deceitful dwarf [veteran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) with earth "elemental ancestry", is willing to murder anyone who tries to probe into their business.

### Serpent's Head

"Thordak" only flew to the "Cliffkeep Mountains" once during his occupation of "Emon". No one living knows why the nearly invincible "Cinder King" left his prized city to attack a single, isolated mountaintop village, but the ruins of "Serpent's Head" prove that he did.

"Serpent's Head" is a squat mountain in the southern reaches of the "Cliffkeep Mountains". Its people were mostly "dwarves" and "humans", miners and farmers. They had no militia to speak of, and most had already evacuated to "Kraghammer" when news of "Emon's" fall reached them—but not everyone.

The village that surrounds "Serpent's Head" Mountain is an ashen ruin. The immolated corpses of its people still lay buried beneath a thick layer of ash, and the mountain itself was transformed into a small volcano by "Thordak's" magic.

#### Serpent's Head Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Serpent's Head" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Factions of Flame (any level)

Characters who wish to plumb the depths of "Serpent's Head" for treasure—or perhaps to find an item or character connected to the greater story of your campaign—must contend with the creatures that have made it their home. Mindless [cinderslag elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cinderslag-elemental-tdcsr.md) prowl the shattered battlements of the fortress that once stood atop the mountain. Earth tremors have cracked the keep's foundation, revealing deep magma caverns filled with diamonds—precious and infused with chaotic magic. Occasionally, tiny rifts to the Elemental Plane of Fire flash open within the depths, allowing groups of [azer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/azer.md) and [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) to wriggle through. The two factions have made camp in the lower caverns, and both struggle for a foothold in the Material Plane.

##### Hot-Headed Wanderers (high-level)

The "Cinder King's" incursion into Tal'Dorei attracted elementally infused monsters from deep beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains" to the surface. [Magma landsharks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magma-landshark-tdcsr.md) and their [young](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/young-magma-landshark-tdcsr.md) are the worst of these monsters, and even decades after the "Cinder King's" defeat, they continue to prowl the mountains from their nests beneath "Serpent's Head", devouring entire villages unless brave adventurers stand in their way.

### Terrah

- **Village.** Population 838 (61% "humans", 19% "dwarves", 5% "gnomes", 15% "other races")  

Sheltered within a cauldron-like valley, miles deep into the northern mountain range, lies the home of the Earth "Ashari". The people of "Terrah" have long stood watch over the exposed rift to the Elemental Plane of Earth, protecting the ever-quaking ground of this crumbling valley. Those without druidic power dig long trenches around their village to protect their people against rockslides that roll off the mountains, while a handful of mighty druids use their magic to reshape the valley and rebuild damaged structures.

Living off hunted game and scavenged fungi, the "Terrah" people are stocky warriors of stubborn mind and immense pride and loyalty. Jewelry made of precious gemstones is regarded as a sign of station and respect. The Earth "Ashari" supply "Emon" with precious and semi-precious stones from the rift in exchange for essential goods and, occasionally, protection from the creatures of the mountains.

The peaks that surround the rift frequently seem to shake with rage, and from their angry slopes rise creatures of living stone, imbued with life by elemental spirits from the rift. The people of "Terrah" sleep in shifts to keep watch for any sudden changes in seismic activity, lest the fury of the mountains undo all that "the Ashari" have created.

#### Government

"Terrah" is governed by an "Ashari" archdruid given the honored title of Heart of the Mountain. This archdruid has completed their "Aramente" and earned the respect of the four elemental enclaves of "the Ashari". Pa'tice, the current Heart of the Mountain, is a human man well over one hundred years old. Though tenacious and ornery, he is a venerable warrior with boundless appreciation and support for those who prove themselves honorable and self-reliant. Rumor has it that Pa'tice is seeking a worthy druid who can undertake the Aramente and succeed him as Heart of the Mountain.

#### Terrah Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in "Terrah" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Pestering Pa'tice (any level)

Rumor has spread throughout the "Cliffkeeps" that the Earth "Ashari" are seeking a new Heart of the Mountain. In response, dozens of upstart druids with delusions of grandeur have flocked to "Terrah", seeking to impress the current leader of the Earth "Ashari". Pa'tice can't be bothered with this pageantry, and quietly hires a group of adventurers—the characters—to disperse these druids. If there is a druid in the party, perhaps their actions will impress the Heart of the Mountain and set them on the path of the Aramente.

##### Dependable as Stone (high-level)

The "Terrah" people are insular and dutiful, and rarely take sides in any conflict. However, sometimes times of great peril require that even "the Ashari" go to war. Whatever the conflict, the characters must convince the "Terrah" to join their cause. Pa'tice meets with them and grimly states that the "Terrah" cannot aid them because a terrible new threat has come through the portal. The Stonesight Council, four [medusas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md) aided by two [gorgons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gorgon.md), now command the [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) descending from the peaks around "Terrah". Pa'tice is a practical leader—he cannot lead his people to fight a threat to the outside world while danger lurks on their doorstep. "Eliminate this threat to Terrah," Pa'tice says, "and perhaps we can join your cause."

### Umbra Hills

The "Battle of the Umbra Hills", the climactic battle of the "Scattered War" and the death knell of the Kingdom of "Drassig", transformed the floral, sun-dappled Emerald Highlands into a blasted wasteland. A tide of demonic blood spilled across the highlands like fire, cursing the land forever. Generations have passed, but the heather that once grew on these hills is as black and burnt as the day of the battle. No animals live here, and the only plant that grows in the "Umbra Hills" now is shadegrass. Its ash-gray stalks are dry and unfilling, but its unique, acrid flavor has drawn the interest of spice traders worldwide, propelling wealthy merchants to hire armed escorts for their spice-pickers.

Though no animals live here, danger still lurks within the "Umbra Hills". Undead soldiers rise from the grass when the silvery moon Catha is high, and the ruins of ancient "Drassig" war camps seem to draw demons of all types, still bound by the contract between "Trist Drassig" and the Demon Prince of Indulgence. Pathetic [dretches](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/dretch.md) gambol about in the ruins' long shadows, and rumors say that, on nights when the moon Ruidus is full, even mighty [balor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/balor.md) demons prowl the hills in search of mighty souls to corrupt.

#### Umbra Hills Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Umbra Hills" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Sword of the Demon Prince (high-level)

In a dream, a skilled warrior within the party continually sees visions of a noble, kingly sword embedded in the ground, surrounded by shadows and demons. "Free me," it whispers. "I need your help...I am in the "Umbra Hills"." The sword is not as it appears; though the Demon Prince of Indulgence was defeated at the "Battle of the Umbra Hills" and banished to the Abyss, his accursed greatsword still lingers. The last shard of his malevolence in this world, [Graz'tchar, the Decadent End](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/graztchar-the-decadent-end-tdcsr.md) rests in the center of the valley, its tip embedded in the earth. The alluring, androgynous [marilith](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md) demons that guard it pretend to be the ghosts of great knights, protecting the blade of a lost Sovereign of Tal'Dorei.

![Sun light breaks through d...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-umbrasword.webp#center "Sun light breaks through dark, stormy clouds overtop a rocky terrain. In the foreground, a sword is embedded in the ground with dark vines twisting around the blade and hilt.")

### Grey Valley

North of the "Umbra Hills" lies a wide valley of ill omen and dark history, named for the forest of petrified trees that fill the majority of the valley's forest floor. During the "Scattered War", "Trist Drassig" obsessed over the possibility of losing and pledged his service to the Demon Prince of Indulgence in exchange for power to smite his foes.

The bargain accepted, the demon prince sent his forces to this valley to aid Trist in the "Battle of the Umbra Hills", but ultimately both fell to the incredible strength of the rebelling forces. The release of terrible energies exploded across the battlefield. Now left cursed and lifeless, the valley remains a warning against dealing with demons—and a dangerous locus of darker entities that are drawn to the ruined place.

#### Grey Valley Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Grey Valley" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Heart of the Wraithroot (high-level)

At the dead center of the "Grey Valley" is a petrified tree unlike any other. Knots in its stony bark gaze like eyes at its withered domain. This [wraithroot tree](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/wraithroot-tree-tdcsr.md) is the eternal guardian of a dark treasure. Rumors abound about what could be secreted away behind this vile guardian—a relic of a demon prince, the crown of "Drassig", or an artifact of the "Betrayer Gods" unknown to mortal minds? The true nature of this artifact is up to the Game Master, but whatever it is, rumors of its existence have lured countless adventurers to their deaths.

## Stormcrest Mountains

Spanning Tal'Dorei's southern reaches, buttressed against the "Verdant Expanse", stand the massive "Stormcrest Mountains". The winds of the "Lucidian Ocean" wail through the storm-battered peaks, and few dare make these treacherous mountains their home. The few who do live amidst the Stormcrests are ferocious monstrosities and the "giantkin" strong enough to defeat them—and those few peoples cunning enough to evade storm, monster, and giant alike. The only friendly towns anywhere near these forsaken peaks lie in the "Mornset Countryside" pushing along the Stormpoint range, far beyond the influence of the "Tal'Dorei Council". These rugged folk are used to fending for themselves and scoff at the thought of returning to so-called "civilization," preferring life among the swamps and shadowed forests of their homeland.

### Ashen Gorge

One mountain stands out among the Stormcrests. Its twin peaks rumble with fury, breathing fire and smoke into the sky to mingle with the storm clouds that surround the mountains. Lightning tears through the ashen clouds with giddy excitement, making it clear to all who behold it that this is a place of supernatural power. Cartographers in "Emon" call this crater the "Ashen Gorge", but the people of the low valleys call it the Dragon's Throne, for they know what creature once lived atop the mountain. They remember when they too were under the dominion of "Thordak the Cinder King".

Today, several tenuous alliances of [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md), "dragonblood", [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md), and even a few young dragons trying to expand their treasure hoards battle for dominion over this ruined vale. When the mountain was the lair of the "Cinder King" during his first incursion into Tal'Dorei, the [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) and [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) flocked to his side, worshiping his might and cruelty. Though "Thordak" is slain, his influence yet lingers, and his legend draws treasure hunters and would-be tyrants to this place. Gold, jewels, and magic items from all ages of the world lie in wait within the dozen or more secret vaults of the "Cinder King's" lair. When the king of dragons still held dominion here, he had thousands of loyal scaled minions at his beck and call, moving invaluable treasures into deeper and deeper holds. Beyond the main cavern of the lair, even the "Cinder King" himself had to magically take humanoid form to traverse the winding tunnels his servants carved through the rock.

The descendants of "Thordak's" servitors now fight an endless war over his treasure. Every year, it seems a petty new "Cinder King" rises to power within the "Ashen Gorge", but they are always dethroned before their minions can enter the ancient vaults, still locked after all this time. To steal "Thordak's" greatest treasures, an adventuring party would have to either broker a peace between the warring clans or somehow sneak into the mountain undetected.

The following major factions fight for control over the "Ashen Gorge". They make and break their alliances with one faction or another, and then break their new alliances just as readily. You can use these factions to inspire adventures set in the "Ashen Gorge".

#### Scions of Flame

This cult of black-scaled [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) claim to have been "Thordak's" elite guard in ancient times, and are the current rulers of the gorge. They're led by a five-hundred-year-old druid named Burning Oak, and while his awesome magic keeps the other tribes at bay, his frailty makes him vulnerable to attack—and the other tribes know it.

![Two green lizardfolk warri...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-ashengorgewarriors.webp#center "Two green lizardfolk warriors crouch down in rocky terrain with a mountain behind them. Each one holds a long spear, with one of them bearing a leather-bound shield.")

#### Tinysoot

Every ten years brings a new generation of [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md), and while the Tinysoot tribe's warriors are not the mightiest, their overwhelming numbers have allowed them to overwhelm even the greatest of the Flame Scions' champions. The Tinysoots' leader, a stubborn young Queen of Soot named Yabber Tinysoot XIX, wears around her neck the key to Everflame Crevasse, "Thordak's" deepest treasure vault.

#### Black Snow

When "Thordak's" ally, Umbrasyl, was slain atop "Gatshadow", his caustic blood seeped into the corpses of a dozen goliath scouts from the Herd of Storms. The black dragons' magic, combined with the foul power of "Gatshadow" itself, transformed the "goliaths" into a squadron of undead black "dragonblood" warriors. Skeletal wings sprouted from their backs, and the Black Snow tribe flew instinctively to the "Ashen Gorge". They were drawn to the Ruby of Oblivion, a pitch-black ruby of immense unholy power—now stored in the Obsidian Geode, a treasure vault guarded by a legion of golems and elementals. This squadron of hateful revenants is small, but each one of them wields the strength of twenty lesser warriors.

#### Tatterwing Kin

Toxoshuul, Chloroxodon, and Snagglefang, a trio of [young green dragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md), long to plunder "Thordak's" lost vaults for their own hoards, and demand tribute from the other factions of the "Ashen Gorge" in exchange for their aid in battle. All three are the children of Tatterwing, a feared dragon of the Kirmont Valley, and even if they find themselves on opposite sides of a skirmish, they never fight one another, only annihilating the pathetic humanoids beneath them with their toxic breath and razor-sharp talons.

### Dreamseep Marshlands

East of the Stormcrest Range, within the Kirmont Valley, is the sprawling, fetid Dreamseep Marsh. The perpetual rain rolling off the Stormcrests' enchanted slopes has transformed this once-lush forest into a morass of rotting vegetation, sulfurous mud, and gnarled, weeping trees. So many cruel murders have been committed within the Dreamseep that the very land is cursed, forsaken by the gods. Negative energy pools there like water, and the dead drink deep of it. The marsh is populated by more than just the walking zombies of killers and their victims—awful amalgamations of dozens of bodies, both humanoid and bestial, are birthed within the Dreamseep's putrid womb.

Somewhere in the middle of this accursed realm is a sinkhole that plunges deep beneath the earth. At its deepest point is the Tomb of Udah, a fabled necropolis of countless chambers, littered with traps and treasures that have claimed the lives and imaginations of untold hundreds. Every death within Udah's accursed walls only adds to the legions at its dread master's command; characters who explore its tunnels face not only undead warriors in armor from a bygone millennium, but steely warriors in armor from every epoch in Tal'Dorei history.

The small community of Bronbog holds the only lights of civilization within the shadows here, and those that continue to thrive against the oppressive swamp are hearty and stubborn folk..

##### Skull of Udah (epic-level)

Two rumors persist of the Tomb of Udah. First, it is said that within the tomb's deepest sanctum is a three-eyed golden skull, and that in each socket is inlaid a ruby that can grant any wish. Second, the locals say that, unlike the mindless undead of the "Dreamseep" above, the abominations in the necropolis below are commanded by a hideous master. Little do these rumor-spreaders know that the skull and the master are one and the same. Udah the Undying is a [lich](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/lich.md) of tremendous power, devouring the souls of all who die within the "Dreamseep". His disembodied spirit controls the dungeon itself, and only retreats into the skull—the last remnant of his physical form—when it is in danger.

### Bronbog

- **Village.** Population 683 (53% "humans", 18% "half-elves", 11% "goblinkin", 9% "halflings", 9% "other races")  

If there ever was a civilization that called the "Dreamseep" home, Bronbog is all that remains of it. Its buildings are made from planks of waterlogged bogwood, and the only sign of its previous greatness is the ring of stone pillars that once supported the Temple of the Dawnfather. Even though the temple to their patron god has crumbled, the people of Bronbog keep the faith; their belief in the sun god's afterlife is their greatest comfort against their meager lives. Yet, for all the gloom that surrounds the "Dreamseep Marshlands", the Bronboggi maintain a determinedly optimistic disposition. There's a saying in the village: "If you don't feel the storm, you can't know there ain't sun."

The only reason anyone north of the "Stormcrest Mountains" knows of Bronbog is because of queenscap, a rare swamp fungus that serves as a reagent in creating potent potions of superior healing. It's been harvested almost to extinction in the more accessible "K'Tawl Swamp", and Tal'Dorei's alchemists will pay good money for a shipment.

The biggest building in Bronbog is its tavern, the Queen's Knight, which has about six beds in drafty rooms to accommodate the town's very few visitors.

#### Bronbog Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in Bronbog can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### Morning Glory (mid-level)

On a queenscap-gathering expedition to Bronbog, an unusual storm forces the characters to stay the night. As they spend time in the swamp town, vine-choked stone obelisks slowly emerge from the murky waters, emanating an unearthly light. Some villagers immediately fall under the obelisks' sway, claiming they are "heralds of the Dawnfather, the rising sun," but all others are disturbed by their neighbors' feverish worship of the stones.

The true power behind these obelisks is a misguided [deva](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) that calls himself Eclipse. He seeks to create a brainwashed, perfectly loyal Army of the Dawn to fight against the Dawnfather's enemies. He is posing as Father Larkylai, the town's affable priest of the Dawnfather, and conducts services from within the town's tavern.

### The Frostweald

Along the northern base of the Stormcrests is a forest locked in perpetual winter, cursed to eternal cold by the invasion of "Errevon the Rimelord" during the "Icelost Years". Within the forest, ponds magically freeze into perfect mirrors, reflecting the snowy sky above, and the snow-draped trees shelter families of fey hiding from enemies in the Fey Realm. At first, the "Frostweald" seems a wonderland of crisp snow and aromatic pines and firs, yet the serene landscape belies sinister danger. Herds of [basilisks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/basilisk.md) roam the woods, and travelers who encounter mysterious snow-covered statuaries or copses of petrified trees must think fast or join this grisly statuary—permanently.

#### Frostweald Inhabitants

The only humanoid peoples who live within the "Frostweald" are hunter-gatherers called the Shivergut. Many of their people are "orcs" who have lived within the "Frostweald" for generations, but their ranks also include "humans", "elves", and "dwarves" who adopted their ways centuries ago during the "Icelost Years". Most are helpful to travelers, if reserved. Others, however, are dour, selfish isolationists who have been apart from other folk for so long that they care more for the thrill of bloodshed than a warm conversation over a crackling fire.

The "Frostweald" is also home to a host of benevolent fey, most of them pixies or dryads, using the forest as a safe haven away from the Fey Realm. If pressed for answers on why they left the Fey Realm, their answers are cryptic and dissatisfactory, but always ominously suggest a "Great Shadow" has descended upon their lands—perhaps even a host of warriors from the Plane of Shadow? A nymph named Arethusa watches over a cluster of three mirror-like pools that form a pathway into the Fey Realm, each to a different Archfey's forest. She is suspicious of all mortals, and both her trust and a favor are required to gain passage.

#### Ruins of the Frostweald

Many forgotten obelisks of the Knowing Mentor rest secretly beneath the ice and snow. These lost beacons were created to guide the faithful of the Knowing Mentor to the "Cavern of Axiom", a sacred place guarded since time immemorial by a [sphinx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/androsphinx.md) dedicated to the Mentor. If any living creature knows why these ancient monoliths reside here when no other ruins of the Knowing Mentor have been discovered, they have kept the knowledge secret from the other scholars of the world. Over thirty years ago, the half-orc "Emonian" archaeologist Jorlund Vohr discovered a cache of [Ioun stones](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ioun-stone.md) buried here and brought them to the "Alabaster Lyceum" of "Emon", but his research and findings were stolen the week after he returned. Vohr has since stated he "got over it," and is back to work on new research on "Visa Isle".

This poem was discovered by Jorlund Vohr on his first expedition to the "Frostweald", on a silver tablet written in flowing Celestial script. Upon examination, scholars at the "Alabaster Lyceum" discovered the language of the heavens is so sublime that its poetry rhymes even when translated into any language. The tablet was stolen later that week, along with the rest of Vohr's findings, but Jorlund keeps a parchment-and-charcoal copy of the tablet in a chest beneath his bed in "Emon's" "Erudite Quarter".

### Cavern of Axiom

The Cavern of Axiom is a lost shrine to the Knowing Mentor, spoken of only in riddles. Hidden by ever-shifting illusions, the entrance to this cavern opens only to those who are expected by fate. Its entrance looks different to every group that finds it, from the imperious to the humble, but it appears simply as a heavy snowdrift to those not fated to open its doors. Within its shifting facade are dangerous trials designed to test the will and mettle of those who seek the infinite knowledge of the Knowing Mentor. The chambers plunge deeper into the rock beneath the mountain, while half-eroded murals and strange puzzles evaluate any wanderer who seeks an audience with the keeper of the cavern, an ageless [androsphinx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/androsphinx.md) named Kamaljiori. The final challenges presented by the [sphinx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/androsphinx.md) alter from subject to subject, and failure banishes the petitioners from the cavern, barred from ever returning.

### Ruhn-Shak

- **Small City.** Population 6,670 (80% "elves", 12% "dwarves", 5% "gnomes", 3% "other races")  

If you find carved arches and steel gates in the mountain slopes, do not rest there, no matter the cold. There are no grand dwarf-halls among these forsaken peaks.

Deep below the surface world, countless caverns and tunnels wind into regions where light finds no purchase. It is here, beneath the "Stormcrest Mountains", that the largest subterranean society of the Spider Queen's devotees maintains its tyranny. Hidden entrances and tunnels riddle not just the mountain range, but the edges of the "Dreamseep", as well as darker regions of the "Verdant Expanse", granting raiding parties quick and easy access to the surface under cover of night—slaughtering many, capturing the rest, and taking the spoils as gifts to the Spider Queen.

These tunnels, in their twisted network, are easily collapsed and reopened through the use of "Pit Witches," druids who master the art of rock and dirt manipulation, making it near impossible to give chase. The "Wardens of Syngorn" are ever seeking a way to find and destroy this heart of the Spider Queen's power in Tal'Dorei, but the sly and cunning "elves" of Ruhn-Shak have yet to meet their match.

#### Ruhn-Shak Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in Ruhn-Shak can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Dynastic Intervention (any level)

While in "Syngorn", the characters are called by "Ouestra, Voice of Memory", to meet with guests from "Wildemount". They are emissaries of the Kryn Dynasty, a society founded by dark "elves" who fled the Spider Queen's grip and now live on the surface. These Kryn envoys seek to undertake an expedition into "Ruhn-Shak", to try to use the radiant power of their mysterious god, the Luxon, to free their kin from the Spider Queen's evil influence. The characters are offered a fine reward by the "Wardens of Syngorn" to protect these Kryn priests on their mission.

##### A Plea from the Dark (mid-level)

The characters are drawn into the underground tunnels around "Ruhn-Shak" by a psychic message: "I have displeased the Spider Queen; there is nothing I can do but beg for salvation—can anyone hear me?" The message comes from Ry'denyan, a [drow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md) of "Ruhn-Shak" granted telepathic powers by an unknown aberration. This unexpected gift allowed him to break free of his society's brainwashing. He tried to escape, and was exiled into the tunnels, where he will surely be devoured by [driders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/drider.md) unless the characters save him.

### Wrettis

A relic of the "Age of Arcanum", Wrettis is the ruined tower of a powerful mage, one who was driven mad by the seductive whispers of beings from the beyond. What few legends survive of the mage of Wrettis say he was known as Clemain Astural, the Sight Shephard, and that he was a powerful arcanist who peered into a realm beyond the planes in search of power to end the war that ravaged his world. He found it, and thought it would serve him.

He was wrong. Astural's sanity crumbled, but his power only grew, fueled by an entity he called the Sightless One. As devastation crept across southeastern Tal'Dorei, heroes of the land rode to Wrettis to end Astural's chaotic reign, destroy his tower, and bury his corpse in the rubble. Wrettis is now a moss-coated ruin, but some chambers within and below the tower still hold secrets of the mad mage, as well as some of his creations.

> [!note] The Astural Scrolls
> 
> Clemain Astural covered thousands of pages of parchment with his writings, ranging from alchemical formulas to powerful spells to esoteric star charts...but his later notes descend into paranoid, half-crazed ramblings. One of the heroes that killed Astural, a wizard named Atz Yuminor, took as many of the scrolls as he could find and brought them back to his house in the "Dividing Plains". Yuminor's bloodline continues in Estella Ladimar, headmistress of the "Westhall Academy in Westruun" in "Westruun", and many of the Astural Scrolls are kept secretly by the "Scions of Yuminor in the academy's observatory".

## Rifenmist Peninsula

South of the "Stormcrest Mountains" and the "Verdant Expanse" are a number of autonomous communities that live outside the influence of the Republic of Tal'Dorei and its constituent city-states. A number of plans to expand into "Rifenmist" have been brought to the "Tal'Dorei Council", but strong opposition from the "Syngornian" delegation and the Master of Defense have consistently buried these plans before they can come to fruition.

A number of communities exist on the "Rifenmist Peninsula". Some are lost remnants of the "Scattered War" that chose to flee "Drassig's" rule to the isolated and unpopulated "Mornset Countryside" rather than fight against his tyranny. These are the communities that some "Emonian" merchants wish to bring into the fold of Tal'Dorei proper. Farther to the south (and occasionally roaming north into Mornset) are the "Orroyen elves", a collection of nomadic tribes. The "Orroyen" and the "elves" of "Syngorn" see one another as family, and the "Syngornian" delegation refuses to allow the council to interfere with their cousins' way of life.

^1b9

Beyond the Mornset people and the "Orroyen" are a number of other small, individualistic settlements that live in fear of the imperial power that commands Rifenmist: the "Iron Authority". Tal'Dorei's Master of Defense warns the council of provoking this slumbering empire, for they are preoccupied with their unholy conquest of the "Rifenmist Jungle" in the name of their patron deity, the Strife Emperor. A number of "Orroyen elves" and other people of "Rifenmist" long for "Emon's" aid in breaking the grip of the "Iron Authority", but fear that allowing the Republic of Tal'Dorei to gain a military foothold in "Rifenmist" would simply be trading one imperial master for another.

Beyond the political struggles of this realm are terrors only true heroes can survive. Enormous, ancient beasts stalk the vine-twisted paths of the jungle that consumes the majority of the peninsula's coastline. An expanding morass of fungus spreads from a mysterious, corrupt source along the eastern depths of the underbrush, while a secret society of naga-worshippers bring bloody offerings to their snake-queen.

### Beynsfal Plateau

Where below there is life and freedom, above there is naught but death and tyranny. In the high, southern plateaus of "Rifenmist", verdant jungle gives way to a cracked, volcanic landscape, its basalt fields interrupted only by towering structures of black iron. This hellish place is the home of the "Iron Authority", and one of the last battlegrounds of the "Calamity".

It is here that the Betrayer God known as the Strife Emperor, aided by his legions of brainwashed goblinkin, clashed with the Wildmother and her Free Children. Though the Wildmother was victorious and the goblinkin were freed, the site of the Strife Emperor's defeat was reduced to rock and ash, a place where plants would never again grow.

Most of the goblinkin who survived the battle vanished into the jungle and traveled north into the rest of Tal'Dorei, leaving the shame of their connection to the Strife Emperor behind. Centuries later, however, a number of goblinkin still remained among the towering iron of the Strife Emperor's fallen armor. One platoon of [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), the Iron Regiment, devoted themselves wholly to the Strife Emperor, and pledged to revive his glorious legacy of conquest. They press-ganged as many of their kin as they could into armies and created the seed of an empire—one which they watered with blood.

When the Iron Regiment brought all of the Beyensfal Plateau under their rule and transformed themselves into the "Iron Authority", their empire only continued to grow. The Iron Tide never broke, and within a decade, it had engulfed all the other kingdoms along "Rifenmist's" southern coast. They were united under the cruel banner of Tz'Jarr, the Iron Emperor.

While the entirety of Beynsfal is firmly controlled by the "Iron Authority", the empire is still reaching, now locked in a decades-long war to subjugate the native inhabitants of the jungles below: the "Orroyen".

Five major city-states comprise the core of the "Iron Authority", though all swear fealty to the Iron Emperor in its capital of "Tz'Arrm", the southernmost city of the plateau. From south to north, the other imperial city-states are Rybad-Kol, city of the Forge Lords; Hdar-Fye, the necropolis of Prince Hdar; Ezordam-Haar, eyrie of the red pegasi; and Ortem-Vellak, the petrified elventree.

#### Beynsfal Plateau Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure on the "Beynsfal Plateau" and the surrounding mountains can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### The Wayward Bloodline (mid-level)

Tz'Jarr has a single heir to his throne: his [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) child Zuun'dak, nearly of age and currently being groomed to become a great general. However, Zuun'dak has grown up with trepidation regarding the brutality of his society, and after being briefly captured by an outlying "Orroyen" scouting party and learning of the gentler world abroad, he's begun to long for escape and reformation. When the party stumbles upon a disguised and fleeing Zuun'dak, they must decide whether to turn over such a valuable bargaining tool to the "Orroyen", or aid and groom the defecting heir as a rebellious force against his father.

### Mornset Countryside

After a long journey south from "Syngorn", or north from the "Rifenmist Jungle", thick foliage gives way to rolling hills and winding rivers. No great cities are to be seen here, only an untouched wilderness pockmarked by fortified towns. The Mornset Countryside is home to many people whose ancestors fled the rule of "Drassig". Most of these people value their privacy—especially from "Emonian" landscape painters who enrich themselves by romanticizing and exoticizing their idyllic way of life.

The Free Folk of Mornset, as they call themselves, include a wide variety of people who have spurned the ways of their forebears. The bulk of these people are the descendants of refugees from a long-ago war, but a number of Tal'Dorei people who long for freedom from the pressure of modern life have uprooted their lives and journeyed to Mornset to start anew. Likewise, some "Orroyen elves" who dislike the nomadic lifestyle find homes in the small communities of Mornset.

Beyond those who follow their hearts to this realm, Mornset is also home to a number of criminals fleeing persecution. Most Free Folk don't ask questions about newcomers' pasts, and welcome them regardless. However, if these particular outlanders don't leave their past behind and continue to harm others, or bring bounty hunters (or worse) in their wake, every village in Mornset has a well-trained militia that will eagerly remove dangerous folk from their midst.

Bound by the necessity of survival, the people of this land share a common code of honor called the Fundaments. This code holds all to a baseline of respect for all travelers and outcasts, and codifies ancient principles of hospitality. Each denizen of the countryside looks out for their neighbor, and if a person in need arrives upon one's doorstep, the hospitality of food and shelter must be provided.

It is understood that the Fundaments may be taken advantage of by ruffians and power-hungry upstarts. Nevertheless, this code of honor has served the Free Folk well for centuries, and anyone who scorns it is looked upon with disdain and mistrust. Most of the Mornset Free Folk are humanoids, but many free settlements have alliances with the local [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md), [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md), and [ogres](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) that help protect them against the "Iron Authority" to the south.

#### Mornset Adventures

##### Anger Everburning (low-level)

A number of residents of the uncharted village of Heldenfaire have been unexpectedly—and suddenly—flying into a rage both mindless and destructive. Many within the village are confused, fearing a plague of violent madness, and they seek adventurers (especially parties with clerics or skilled healers) to save them. Investigation by the party reveals that each individual driven to these fits is connected to the town alchemist's dark past and a failed herbalism experiment from ten years ago, when she lived in "Kymal". If the characters wish to find an antidote, they must explore the alchemist's sinister laboratory in the hills.

### Byroden

- **Town.** Population 8,050 (45% "humans", 21% "half-elves", 12% "goblinkin", 8% "halflings", 8% "gnomes", 6% "other races")  

The northernmost and largest town in the "Mornset Countryside", "Byroden" borders the "Gladepools" and marks the first stop for any traveler on their way to the "Rifenmist Peninsula". It's also a hub of trade for the entire "Mornset Countryside", and even some trappers and artisans of the "Verdant Expanse". The town has a dense town center surrounded by palisades and tall wooden walls, but most of the community lives in homesteads and farmhouses spread across the surrounding fields. "Byroden" is mostly self-sufficient, and has a wealth of farmers, fishers, artisans, and miners, giving them everything they need to survive. Trade provides the opportunity for some luxuries, with raw materials serving as their primary currency.

While pleasant and welcoming on the outside, this lifestyle is protected by a fierce and intense drive to defend the community's way of life at the first sign of threat or danger. Most citizens are armed at all times, trained to rise as a communal militia at a moment's notice from the war ringer, a sentinel charged with the town's protection.

Despite (or perhaps because of) the ever-present dangers that threaten "Byroden", the town holds frequent festivals, feasts, and fairs, including the highly anticipated Gem of "Byroden" pageant and the midsummer Peachiest Pie bake-off. On festival days, small children roam freely within the protective town walls as their parents enjoy the chance to let loose and celebrate life in all its ephemeral glory.

#### Hillmaw Chasm

A few miles north of the center of "Byroden" is a gaping chasm. An earthquake thirty years ago split open Deercrest Hill. The chasm is referred to officially as Deercrest Ravine, but is known to most superstitious folk in town as Hillmaw Chasm. After the earthquake, locals stayed as far away from the chasm as they could—until four years later, when a group of adventurers found vast veins of precious [gold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gold.md) and sturdy [iron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iron.md) within. Soon, all people of "Byroden" strong enough to swing a pick or lift a shovel made their way into the chasm.

Most miners hire an armed escort because the chasm is known to be home to grumpy [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md), as well as unpleasant, slimy creatures of the dark. Most serious beliefs about the chasm being haunted have dissipated over the past thirty years. Still, rumors persist, and as folklore becomes myth, some say that myth can become reality.

#### Advent of the Cinder King

About forty years ago, "Byroden" was brought to its knees by "Thordak the Cinder King". This incursion was about two decades before the "Cinder King's" destruction of "Emon", and it was stopped by an adventuring party led by "Allura Vysoren", now a senior member of the "Tal'Dorei Council". Many in "Byroden" still see "Allura", Lady Kima of Vord, and "Drake Thunderbrand" as heroes. The graves of the companions they lost in that fight, Sirus Kaldrem, Dohla Lorian, and Ghenn Talevesh, hold places of honor in the town cemetery.

While "Byroden" has long-since been built anew, the terror of that day still lives on in its elders and adults. All but the youngest generation of "Byroden" takes great caution against another such monstrous attack—as well as against any attack by the "Iron Authority" to the south.

##### Ironbound Scouts (low-level)

All are awoken in "Byroden" by the ringing of the town's alarm bell, including the characters. As the town militia is armed for battle, the characters overhear that [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) scouts of the "Iron Authority" have been spotted twenty miles south of town—closer than they've been seen in nearly two decades.

Worried that this scouting party is an omen of invasion, the town's war ringer deputizes the characters and offers them a handsome sum of money to investigate the scouting camp. Their goal is simple: learn the interlopers' mission, either by interrogating their commander or by finding a written command note. And, if the characters can capture or eliminate the scouts before the town's upcoming festival, the locals will celebrate their success with all the free food and drink they can stomach.

##### The Dreamgate (mid-level)

After a mining expedition goes missing deep within the Hillmaw Chasm, locals begin to report vivid, communal dreams involving members of the missing party pleading for help. A half dozen mercenaries have been hired to investigate—only for them to disappear as well. Just a day before the characters are asked for help, the townsfolk of "Byroden" discovered with horror that the vanished mercenaries have also appeared in their dreams. The adventurers are asked to delve into this unearthed pathway and to find both answers and the missing people.

### Niirdal-Poc

- **City.** Population 15,442 (18% "humans", 17% "goblinkin", 12% "elves", 12% [elephantines](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/loxodon-ggr.md), 10% "half-elves", 7% "elemental ancestry", 24% "other races")  

Long before the "Calamity", a great civilization called the Qoniira made "Rifenmist" their home. During the "Age of Arcanum", the Qoniira Tetrarchy grew from a loose coalition of towns led by arcanists, clerics of the Wildmother, and druids who spoke with the jungle around them. These towns were inhabited by "humans" and the animal-bodied humanoids of the jungle. The first stones of the Qoniiran heart-city Niirdal-Poc were laid by the broad, towering [elephantine people](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/loxodon-ggr.md), and places for new settlements were scouted out by "Catfolk" seers whose eyes glistened with starlight.

#### Surviving the Calamity

In time, the Qoniira civilization grew into a Tetrarchy, with four great satellite cities and the central heart-city of "Niirdal-Poc". The tetrarchs established their cities with mathematical precision. A constellation of the night sky guided them—Surrac's Shield, a four-starred diamond with a fifth star in its center. The constellation still shines over "Rifenmist" and southern Exandria today. The four outer cities of Qoniira match the points of Surrac's shield precisely, and "Niirdal-Poc" is aligned with its center star.

The "Calamity" struck at the peak of Qoniiran civilization, yet rather than take up arms against gods and mortals, the tetrarchs opted to remove themselves from the world—not unlike the "elves" of "Syngorn" to the north. Something happened in "Niirdal-Poc", some sort of magic that even the Qoniirans of today do not understand.

#### Geography

Today, only the heart-city of "Niirdal-Poc" survives. Its satellites are little more than crumbling ruins. Something shifted in the magic of the jungle when the Qoniirans chose not to fight in the "Calamity". The "Rifenmist Jungle" closed its boughs against the world, shielding the city. When the Strife Emperor died on the "Beynsfal Plateau" to the south, the Qoniirans knew nothing of it. All the tumult of the world passed them by.

The "Rifenmist Jungle" sunk "Niirdal-Poc" into a deep basin, and its thick canopies shield it from above, while its intertwining boughs hold the heart-city tightly in its embrace. Few are permitted by the protective, ancient magic of the Qoniirans to enter the city. Its people live contentedly within "Niirdal-Poc", only occasionally traveling outside their basin to trade with "Orroyen nomads" or, in mythically rare instances, with the town of "Byroden".

The four ruins which surround "Niirdal-Poc" are:

##### Niirdal-Gan

This outer city to the north of "Niirdal-Poc" was the agricultural hub of Qoniira. Some farmers have opted to live outside the basin and tend to these still-fertile lands. They are few, for magic is able to supply food for most people of "Niirdal-Poc".

##### Niirdal-Teek

This outer city, east of "Niirdal-Poc", was an academic center of the Qoniiran civilization. Most of the city is one vast university that once was populated by over 30,000 people. Some explorers venture into these ruins to find lost knowledge.

##### Niirdal-Sarqet

Located south of "Niirdal-Poc", this outer city was a center of faith for the Qoniirans. All that remains of the sacred city is a vast, floating cube called the Hexahedron of Sarqet. It is adorned with statues of the "Prime Deities" and the "Betrayer Gods" alike, and none living know what is inside its unbreachable walls. Even today, modern Qoniiran priests teach that balance is the true way of the world, telling their people to invoke the names of the "Prime Deities" for blessings, and of the "Betrayer Gods" for curses.

##### Niirdal-Hup

Precious little remains of this fortress-city, the heart of the Qoniiran military. A common parable reminds those who hear it to not fight fate—for of all the ruined cities, only the city of warriors was reduced to dust.

All of these ruins are filled with statues from the height of the Qoniiran Tetrarchy. Some statues have been known to move under the light of the stars, illuminating hidden runes upon their bodies as they patrol like sentinels of antiquity.

![A large statue of the Obse...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-niirdalpoc.webp#center "A large statue of the Observer stands in the middle of a beautiful, jungle city. The Observer is a feminine humanoid figure, with a cat-like face. Two sets of wings unfurl behind her, her hand outstretched with a star hovering right above it. She is dressed in a long tunic, with a glowing halo behind her.")

#### Government

The Tetrarchy of Qoniira, in ages past, was ruled by four tetrarchs, each of whom ruled one of the civilization's four outer cities. In times where the fate of Qoniira was at a crossroads, they gathered within the heart-city to guide the course of their civilization together.

The relative autonomy of the four outer cities and the looseness of the coalition that bound them seems at odds with the perfect precision with which the cities were built, so precisely matching the stars in the sky. The Qoniirans have always been an easygoing people who typically follow the flow of fate, rather than fight against it.

Today, the tetrarchy survives, even though the four outer cities are in ruins. They gather daily in the Hakredic Dome, an architecturally magnificent granite rotunda adorned with an outer layer of grayish-purple porphyry stone and lifelike, reddish porphyry statues. There, the tetrarchs and their advisors work to keep life simple and content for their people.

The tetrarchy is a hereditary office, but citywide elections are held between eligible heirs to determine which heir should take up their parent's mantle. Elections are also held when a tetrarch's line ends without heirs—often giving advisors a chance to gain power by virtue of their service to the city.

#### Magic Beyond Reckoning

Magic suffuses the city of "Niirdal-Poc". Its magic is something older than the gods, or the "Calamity", or anything wielded by mortals today. However, the mortal mages of "Niirdal-Poc" wield the same arcane force gifted by the gods, and its druids and clerics touch upon the power of the gods behind the Divine Gate, just as Exandria's other mortal peoples do.

Both ancient and modern magic mingle in "Niirdal-Poc", for the patterns of the ancient powers are mysterious, and its methods are unknowable. Some call it the Light of Fate, others the Blessing of the Stars. The most common name is simply "the Gift." It was the Gift that protected "Niirdal-Poc" in the "Calamity". It is the Gift that causes miracles to occur, like a person surviving a fall from the heights of Vedrim's Pinnacle to the streets of the city. It is the Gift that causes the Hexahedron of Sarqet to hover mysteriously; it is the Gift that surrounds the Statue of the Observer, a four-winged feline humanoid figure in the city's center, with a broken halo of ashen-gold light—and that causes that same light to flicker within the lamps of the city.

### Orroyen Tribes

- **Nomadic Tribes.** Population 11,850 (64% "elves", 12% "half-elves", 10% "humans", 14% "other races")  

> [!quote]- A quote from Cloudwriter Ix  
> 
> Storms bring death, but rain brings life. Storms are power, the power of the distant gods, on display for all to see. Climb into the Stormpoints, young one, and shout your fury into the relentless wind and booming thunder. Your prayers may not be answered by the gods, but you will feel them echo in your heart.

^1d0

Born from a wandering colony fleeing the "Calamity", these wood "elves" have not just survived within the jungles of "Rifenmist"—they have flourished. Learning the dangers of the surrounding lands, refining their hunting techniques, and maintaining a healthy arms-length relationship with outsiders, the Orroyen call the jungle their domain and protect it furiously.

The Orroyen tribes have no central government, and their membership shifts as different clans move through the region and encounter other tribes, sometimes trading members as they go. Elders are given the most oversight and respect among a traveling tribe, the eldest given the title of dura, and the duty of leading their tribe. Each nomadic group maintains a population of anywhere between a hundred and a thousand people. Temporary lodging is constructed at each resting point, called a *tomenda*.

Most Orroyen groups remain at a tomenda they've constructed for about two years, before depletion of resources or the arrival of dangerous creatures or soldiers forces them to move on. Countless abandoned tomenda can be found throughout the jungle, and Orroyen clans will frequently make camp in old tomenda made by a different tribe—it is considered a gift from the jungle.

To come into prominence within the tribe, or request admittance into the tribes as an ally or member, a hopeful entrant must complete a series of ceremonial trials. These trials change from dura to dura, but are designed to test strength of body and mind. It is not uncommon for those who attempt these trials to return maimed, or to not return at all, and many elders bear the marks and scars of their trials long past. Few outlanders from the north, known as orfindes to the Orroyen, have been allowed into any of the dozens of Orroyen tribes, and the elders have little intention of changing this, for they have heard distant tales of the ancient tyranny of "Drassig" and the supernatural horrors the people of northern "Gwessar" invite upon themselves.

Nevertheless, the Orroyen are practical, not prideful. They trade often with the Free Folk of Mornset, and sometimes even travel as far north as "Byroden" to trade rare goods. There, some Orroyen meet people from "Syngorn" or beyond and share stories of their lands. Love can bloom in these meetings of separate worlds, and sometime results in an orfinde being brought into an Orroyen clan. And sometimes curious Orroyen leave simply to see the world beyond the jungle.

### Rifenmist Jungle

![In the midst of a thick, o...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-jungletemple.webp#center "In the midst of a thick, overgrown jungle canopy lies the ruins of a keyhole shaped entrance set in a triangular-peaked temple.")

The jungles that cover Tal'Dorei's southern expanses are a vast wilderness. Many "elves" call this lush landscape their home, particularly those of the nomadic "Orroyen Tribes". There is no doubt that this jungle is as magical and mysterious as Tal'Dorei's temperate forests, for the jungle's greenery is home to countless mystical spirits, ferocious monsters, and arcane mysteries. The vine-strangled floors of the jungle are clustered with swollen trunks, spine-laden ferns, and carnivorous plant life that waits for the unknowing wanderer to make an incorrect step.

The sweltering heat of the sun-baked peninsula grows even more oppressive beneath the jungle's humid canopy. Clusters of venomous insects buzz through the mist-shrouded trees, alongside large lizards, and wild beasts in search of carrion. Sunken valleys lead to pockets of marshland or quicksand pit traps, while others are wrought with a dire, spreading fungus. Those who have lived all their lives in this environment know its dangers well and have hundreds of years of precautions to take against them. On the other hand, those who venture into the jungle from northern Tal'Dorei rarely return, and those that do warn others to never make the same mistake.

The farther south one travels into "Rifenmist", the denser the jungle grows. Though some "elves" and "humans" of northern Tal'Dorei have attempted to colonize the jungles for their vast resources in decades past, they were quickly rebuffed by the "Orroyen elves" of the jungle. Their message is clear: no cities are to be built south of the jungle's edge—and if the northern jungles are cleared or burned, the trees' vengeance will be swift and just. The "Tal'Dorei Council" reacted quickly as well—the "elves" of the jungle are to be heeded. The few settlers who have joined the Free Folk of the "Mornset Countryside" are deeply superstitious about the southern jungles, and rarely travel deeper than they need to in order to parley with their "Orroyen" allies.

Even the "Iron Authority", who has been at war with the trees of the jungle itself for decades, has not managed to destroy their foe. The "Orroyen nomads" fear the conquerors of "Beynsfal Plateau" and the massive armies supplied to them by their authoritarian leaders. Their raids ebb and flow as imperial leaders rise and fall. Each new era begins with a bold and cruel warlord rallying their people against their age-old enemy. War is waged, and countless innocents and Authority soldiers perish in a senseless fight. And then resources run low, morale dips, and the legions return to the "Beynsfal Plateau" to lick their wounds.

Legend holds that the jungle will never die, so long as even one of the "Orroyen" lives within it. So far, history has only proved the jungle's enduring strength.

#### Rifenmist Jungle Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Rifenmist Jungle" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### The Insatiable Sanctuary (mid-level)

Long have rumors stirred regarding a vine-obscured temple from an epoch long past, but reports have mapped it at many different locations, with returning expeditions finding it missing. This temple has seemed to reveal itself once more in the northern region of the "Rifenmist", its shadowed passages and secret bounties ripe for the plucking. It isn't until a venturing band delves deeper into the structure that signs begin to reveal the shrine itself to be a living entity, and the treasure a lure to draw in prey.

##### Seed of Immolation (high-level)

Deep beneath the twisted floors of the jungle lies a long-slumbering relic from before the "Founding": an unborn primordial titan seed, its energy responsible for the fertile landscape and extreme overgrowth of the jungle. The "Iron Authority" and their power-hungry clerics of the Strife Emperor have tampered with the seed and unleashed powers beyond their control. The titan has begun to develop and wake from its eons-long slumber. If the process isn't halted, it will fully awaken and terrorize the continent. However, if the seed is destroyed, vast swathes of jungle may wither and die without its magical essence.

### Stormpoint Mountains

The southern offshoot of the "Stormcrest Mountains", the Stormpoint Mountains push deep into "Rifenmist Jungle" itself. These steep peaks are shrouded in low-sitting clouds and fog for most of the year, their rocky surface hidden from view by lush overgrowth that's fed by the near-perpetual rain.

This region is beautiful, and in spring, thousands of waterfalls spray mist and cast gorgeous rainbows across the crags. However, due to its distance from most of Tal'Dorei's population centers, few but adventurers and treasure hunters come here—seeking wealth, not beauty. Some Free Folk from the "Mornset Countryside" and pilgrims of the Wildmother do take great pains to travel here and revel in the Stormpoint Mountains' natural splendor.

##### Allies of the Storm (high-level)

The people of the "Mornset Countryside" and the free people of the "Rifenmist Jungle" long for an end to the tyranny of the "Iron Authority". A group of freedom fighters who have heard of the characters' legendary feats of heroism contact them with a request: help. They lack the funds to request the characters fight the Authority themselves, but they wish for the characters to recruit a clan of [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) that live in the Stormpoint Mountains, including the mighty [cyclops stormcallers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops-stormcaller-tdcsr.md) that lead their people. Once there, the characters learn that their clan is beset by demons who have possessed their [stormcallers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops-stormcaller-tdcsr.md) and are using their mighty powers to conjure a deadly storm to keep the rest of the [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) in submission. Only exorcising the demons and saving the [stormcallers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops-stormcaller-tdcsr.md) will earn the characters their aid.

### Tz'Arrm, Helm of the Emperor

^content-warning-slavery

When the Strife Emperor fought the Wildmother, he took the form of a giant of unimaginable size, clad from head to toe in armor of pitted iron. When he was defeated and cast back into his planar prison, his immense, divine armor remained and crashed to the ground. Centuries have passed, and the thirty-foot tall Helm of Strife is now the palace of the Iron Emperor. The rest of their imprisoned god's armor fuels the unstoppable war machine of the "Iron Authority", melted down to create walls, weapons, and worse.

#### Government

The armies of the "Iron Authority" are strictly regimented, and its society is no less ruthlessly structured. Every [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md), [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), and [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) knows their place within the imperial hierarchy. And every being of other races, including a number of "elves" who have betrayed the "Orroyen" in hopes of gaining power within the Authority, know their place beneath the goblinkin. Iron Emperor Tz'Jarr is the supreme military commander of the empire, loyally served by the four royal generals that rule the empire's individual city-states. Tz'Jarr is unimaginably old, and it is said that his clerics have used blood magic granted to them by their god to sustain him beyond his years.

The military government of the "Iron Authority" is headquartered in Tz'Arrm. Its cultish generals are doggedly focused on maintaining the Authority's war machine—and their own personal power. Beneath these generals are innumerable propagandists, military officials, slave-owning nobles, and their cronies, all of whom ravenously seek a way to climb the ladder of power. No elections are held; positions are only vacated in the event of death or promotion, and all leaders are appointed by the emperor or an immediate superior.

#### Society

As the capital of an empire with an insatiable appetite for expansion and conquest, Tz'Arrm is awash with propaganda and crawling with secret police. In addition to being the headquarters of the military, Tz'Arrm is also the center of operations for the Gauntlet, the empire's intelligence and espionage division. As the children of the Strife Emperor, loyal goblinkin are seen as the supreme citizens of the empire. The upper echelons of the "Iron Authority" are filled almost exclusively by [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), for the Iron Emperor has declared them the strongest and most worthy children of their god. By the same token, goblinkin who betray the empire are seen as the ultimate traitors, and suffer a fate worse than death.

Those with wealth and status within the empire are constantly paranoid about falling out of favor. Even great generals see all those around them as hungry wolves waiting to gobble them up. At the bottom rungs of society are the serving class, who eke out a meager existence as indentured servants for the elite, or as merchants who are bound to whatever master owns their shop. Beneath even them are slaves, most of whom are prisoners of war.

#### Slavery

The armies of the "Iron Authority" have captured tens of thousands of slaves during their wars of conquest across "Rifenmist". The slaves of Tz'Arrm are mostly used as laborers, sent to chisel iron scraps from the Strife Emperor's fallen armor, or to venture back into the lower jungles to forage for food. The elite of the "Iron Authority" sometimes play at benevolence by granting comfortable jobs indoors to slaves skilled in the arts—such as personal portrait-painters, musicians, or sculptors. Such kindnesses are rarely a sign of true mercy; they are more likely a simple (and meager) expression of guilt.

Groups of slaves that pass in and out of the city to labor in the armor yards or furnaces are escorted by a military detachment whose primary purpose is to discourage escape. The powerful people of the city prize their elven slaves above all others, passing them down like heirlooms from generation to generation. "Elves" are treasured possessions by the Authority's despicable elite, not just because of their beauty and long life, but because of how difficult it is to procure slaves from the sheltering boughs of the jungle.

#### Geography and Climate

Tz'Arrm is hellishly hot. The black stone of the "Beynsfal Plateau" and the iron walls of the city trap the heat of the relentless "Rifenmist" sun. The imperial elite enjoy spells that cool their homes and shelter them from the sun, but those who toil under the sun pay a heavy price. The Authority's [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) elite are well suited to such a climate, but their [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) slaves suffer as they toil—as do the "Orroyen elves", whose life in the shady, humid boughs of the "Rifenmist Jungle" has left them unprepared for the blistering heat of the plateau.

## Verdant Expanse

East of the "Stormcrest Mountains", hundreds of miles of massive, unbridled forest shroud the landscape in mystery and shadow. This dense greenwood was for centuries traversed by few but the "elves" of Tal'Dorei, for it was known to be their domain, and theirs alone. Even in the time of "Zan Tal'Dorei", when her rebels and their elven allies saved the realm from tyranny, it was understood that the coasts were humanity's domain, and the woods were that of elvenkind. Times have changed, however. The alliances formed to oppose "Thordak the Cinder King" united virtually all of Tal'Dorei's disparate peoples, and many more than simply "elves" now walk the shaded paths of the "Verdant Expanse". Even so, much of the Expanse is protected by the watchful eyes of the "Wardens of Syngorn", as it has been for hundreds of years.

![A map of the Verdant Expan...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-verdantexpansemap.webp#center "A map of the Verdant Expanse showing a wooded coastline on the Ozmit Sea.

^1df

Merchants travel from "Emon" to "Syngorn" along roads sanctioned for trade, hunters both human and elven alike seek glory in tracking the wild beasts that roam the untamed wilderness, and bands of dark elf raiders from "Ruhn-Shak" prowl the forest under cover of night. This enchanted wood holds the decay of the seasons at bay, and its trees are green year-round.

The "Verdant Expanse" is sustained by a massive confluence of ley lines—rivers of magical power that flow through the earth—after the devastation of the "Calamity" shifted the flow of magic across the world. The region is saturated with magic. Magical creatures flock to the forest's supernaturally vibrant boughs, including wayward fey, [unicorns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md), unusual arcane monstrosities like [owlbears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md), and displaced aberrations that call the darker groves their home.

### The Gladepools

Surrounding the southern edges of the Expanse lies a cluster of broken ponds and lakes that ever draw fresh water from the "Stormcrest Mountains" to the east, along with saltwater from the Ozmit Sea to the west. The strange mix of habitats across this somewhat marshy grassland has led to unusual ecosystems and odd, dangerous denizens, which in turn has drawn the attention of many fishermen from the "Rifenmist" region, and of "Syngornian" hunters from within the "Verdant Expanse".

The clay and silt gathered along the shores of the saltwater lakes can be refined into fine ceramics and simple constructs that fetch fair prices in northern Tal'Dorei. "Syngornian" tradition tells of an oracle's spirit that is bound to the lakes, and when given sufficient offering and respect, the oracle will emerge to grant sufficiently reverent supplicants a cryptic prophecy.

#### Gladepools Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Gladepools" can use this plot hook for inspiration.

##### No Basis for a System of Government (any level)

While traveling along the edge of the "Gladepools", an elf character, or a character with elven ancestry, notices a gleaming [longsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md) embedded in the bank of the lake. No one but that character can see it until they draw it from the mud. Flowing elven script upon the blade reads, "Whosoever draws this blade bears the mantle of the true scion of Yenlara."

Attempts to appraise the sword and discover if it's a true ancient "Syngornian" artifact plunge the characters into a dark conspiracy that lurks at the heart of "Syngorn": The High Warden may be wise and just, but she is not the rightful ruler—at least, she is not Yenlara's heir. Centuries ago, someone strove to subvert Yenlara's bloodline. Why? And, if the High Warden is truly a good ruler, does the bloodline deserve to be restored?

![A city composed of glowing...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-gladepools.webp#center "A city composed of glowing towers and domes surrounds a lake of water at the base of a mountain. A starry night and crescent moon are seen overhead and reflected in the water.")

### The Mirescar

Deep within the western reaches of the "Verdant Expanse" is a region where the trees grow so close together that sunlight is barely permitted to pass through their boughs. These ancient trees cluster and twist into a labyrinth of knotted roots and branches, while a tangled canopy of drooping foliage and gray moss blocks the sky from view. Strange powers dwell within the Mirescar, and beasts and travelers that wander into its depths often emerge with their hearts and flesh touched by a deep and corrupting evil—if they emerge at all. The woodlands surrounding the Mirescar are rife with dire beasts, cruel fey, and many-eyed aberrations.

The Mirescar is the subject of countless "Syngornian" folk tales, many of which purport to tell the true story of how it was formed. Some say it contains the bones of a titan. Others say that a meteor from Ruidus itself landed in the forest. Another, that the Spider Queen cursed it during the "Calamity". Any one of the tales may be true—or none of them. Only adventurers of great courage and skill have the power to penetrate deep enough into the Mirescar to learn the truth and retain their humanity.

More often than not, these tales serve to frighten the people of "Syngorn" and "Byroden" away from the region altogether.

#### Mirescar Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the Mirescar can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### A Sickness Spreads (mid-level)

A plague has begun to spread from the Mirescar. People living in the woods around this evil realm are suffering as they fall blind, with milky-white eyes; or their bodies are wracked by fevers; or they are struck by a number of other mysterious symptoms. All are aware that the vile Mirescar is the source of the [contagion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md). The characters are hired to delve into its boughs and find a cure, or to at least stem the flow of disease.

In ancient times, the Mirescar was called the Heartwood. It was the domain of a wise and kindly [guardian naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/guardian-naga.md) named [Sagacitous Erusaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sagacitous-erusaire-tdcsr.md), who welcomed all with good hearts to share their bounty or receive alms. However, this [naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sagacitous-erusaire-tdcsr.md) has been corrupted into a cruel shadow of his former self. He and his [diseased grick](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/diseased-grick-tdcsr.md) minions have been twisted into hideous, pus-oozing spreaders of disease—and spreading it is now the only thought in their minds. The [naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sagacitous-erusaire-tdcsr.md) can cast [contagion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) at will, and his [diseased grick](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/diseased-grick-tdcsr.md) minions can do so once per day. Is it possible to save the mind of this corrupted guardian?

> [!note]
> Use the [Sagacitous Erusaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sagacitous-erusaire-tdcsr.md) and [diseased grick](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/diseased-grick-tdcsr.md) statblocks for this adventure hook.

##### Tree of Scarred Knowledge (high-level)

A [wraithroot tree](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/wraithroot-tree-tdcsr.md) dwells at the heart of the Mirescar. It is covered with deep gouges, all of which open and close like eyes and mouths as it watches and, on occasion, speaks in a hissing voice to its surroundings. It stands atop a fell artifact—the very thing that turned the Mirescar to evil in ancient times—and has drunk deep of this artifact's forbidden knowledge and its cruelty.

The tree is excited to bargain with any creature that meets it, trading secrets of unknowable origin for the memories held most dear. It fears no attack, for it is protected by a small legion of [invisible stalkers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) that enact its will throughout the Mirescar.

### The Shifting Keep

The Verdant Guard has a secondary base of operations, beyond "Syngorn's" walls, called the "Shifting Keep". It is built within and around a cluster of massive, living trees that form the heart of the "Verdant Expanse", and enchanted with the most powerful illusion magic that could be mustered by "Syngorn's" military arcanists and their guild of Spellbenders. Enchantments woven into the keep's foundations allow it to cloak its presence, seemingly vanishing and reappearing elsewhere within the forest at will.

The "Shifting Keep" can't teleport, but it can turn [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and project an illusion of itself to any point within a mile of its true location. This remarkable enchantment has made it almost impossible for invaders to besiege the keep, and it played a major role in "Syngorn's" victory against Neminar "Drassig" in the "Scattered War"—tales of the unassailable "Shifting Keep" are told in "Syngorn" to this day. Nearly a thousand trained elven warriors, hunters, and spies call the "Shifting Keep" their home, though many spend their time patrolling and exploring the "Verdant Expanse". These rangers are vigilant, seeking signs of whatever foolish invaders would dare trifle with the might of "Syngorn".

### Syngorn

- **City.** Population 38,540 (85% "elves", 9% "humans", 3% "halflings", 3% "other races")  

Founded by the sorceress Yenlara in the wake of the "Divergence", "Syngorn" became the heart of elven civilization on Tal'Dorei following its calamitous destruction. The remnants of the fallen Court of Ullusa fled to the Fey Realm for a generation following the end of the "Age of Arcanum", returning only when Yenlara found the realm safe to return. These four hundred survivors built a new home, taking inspiration from their temporary home among the fey, and formed the foundations of "Syngorn". Though "elves" have spread all across Tal'Dorei, even as far as the frigid "Neverfields", there was once a time where nearly all of them resided in "Syngorn".

This beautiful city of curving stone is built in harmony with the trees of the "Expanse" and sits against the western base of the "Stormcrest Mountains". It is all but impervious to external assault—not simply because of its 40-foot-high walls of ivy-covered [jade](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jade.md), and not only because it's also surrounded by living trees of the "Verdant Expanse" and beacons of detection that keep constant vigil for intruders. No, "Syngorn" is virtually unassailable because every entrance to the city is warded by a series of threshold crests: massive emblems of a crescent moon, flanked by two trees, over a deep cerulean stone. These enchanted stones act as an anchor to the Fey Realm, where "Syngorn's" founders once recovered, allowing the city itself to vanish tracelessly into the Fey Realm as a final act of preservation.

> All here will say to you that Syngorn is a city without equal on Exandria. Its towers and bowers are impeccable, yes. Its cloisters and arches so graceful and fine they make your heart ache, yes, it has been said. But our dreams and memories are the most precious treasure here. They flicker like fireflies through the night, and they are heard in the laughter of the youngest elven child, and in the reminiscing groans of the eldest of our kind.

^1e9

#### Government

The city has been governed since its inception by the "High Warden", a hereditary monarch who appoints proven individuals to three other offices alongside them as the "Wardens of Syngorn". Each Warden carries a title and bears a responsibility to guide the city toward safety and prosperity. The Verdant Lord is the head of the city guard, though they delegate this responsibility to a Vice Protector when leading the armies of "Syngorn" to war abroad.

The Guildrunner manages the city's treasury and oversees commerce within "Syngorn's" borders. The "Voice of Memory" is a heralded keeper of history and culture, and is often seen interacting with the elven people, gathering new memories for the archives. The High Warden has always been of Yenlara's bloodline, and is responsible for keeping order within "Syngorn" and its territories, as well as within the "Wardens" themselves.

#### Society

"Syngorn" is steeped in elven tradition that dates back to before the "Divergence". The arts are lauded and revered, the pursuit of knowledge is respected and encouraged, and some training in refined martial techniques is culturally expected. The idea of trade between other cities and nations is understood to be both healthy and beneficial, but most foreign trade and travel is relegated to outer areas of the city.

There was a time that few foreigners ever saw "Syngorn's" innermost reaches, but that time has passed. "Syngorn's" gates are open to travelers from across Tal'Dorei—though all who visit the city are bound by "Syngorn's" strict cultural laws to respect their millennia-old traditions. Any who disrespect the ways of "Syngorn" are warned but once, and are thrown out of the city thereafter. Delicate crafts by "Syngornian" hands are sought after by collectors around the world, so many "Syngornians" take up the trade for both profit and honor.

In a populace made up of people who are extraordinarily long-lived, having children is a rare and highly-regulated process. Prospective parents must gain approval from the office of the "Voice of Memory" to procreate, and any unapproved children are sent out of the city to be raised in outposts or foreign cities. All "elves" call such an occasion "regrettable," and truly do treat it with sorrow—but the laws of "Syngorn" are clear on this point, and few "elves" are willing to speak out against rulings which have stood for a thousand years.

#### Crime

If "Syngorn" appears free of crime, it's because elven criminals have hundreds of years of experience at lurking in the shadows. A thriving market for illegal goods runs invisibly through the city's guilds. Though time often seems to stand still in "Syngorn", crime moves with the same celerity as it does in other cities—it must, if the criminal underbelly wants to stay one step ahead of the "Wardens of Syngorn".

The most common contraband to pass through "Syngorn" are shipments of [suude](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md), stolen goods, and dwarven trinkets. Many come to "Syngorn" to purchase these goods for a low price on the black market, but those unwilling to make a journey and risk being stopped by the Verdant Guard can wait for these goods to make their way up to "Kymal", where they can be purchased at an outrageous markup of five times their cost in "Syngorn".

Most people in "Syngorn" have their basic needs taken care of by the city's government, to ensure the wellbeing of their people. Nevertheless, some people still fall into poverty, and these destitute individuals are often preyed upon by pickpockets, swindlers, and smugglers who seek to use them as patsies for a paltry sum of gold.

#### Geography and Climate

The perpetual shade of the thick, green canopy of the forest maintains cooler weather throughout the summer months, while this far south, the ice and snow of winter is present, but minimal.

"Syngorn" is broken up into six main districts and has a variety of neighborhoods:

##### Memory Ward

The mind of "Syngorn" is contained within a ring of marble walls in "Syngorn's" northeast reaches. A winding stair, the One Thousand Steps, leads up to its lofty gate. Standing in the center of its grand court is the mystical Sequoia of Remembrance, a three-hundred-foot-tall redwood within which are stored the lives and memories of every elf in Tal'Dorei. At least, those whose bodies are brought before the sequoia and are granted the Rite of Remembrance, as performed by the "Voice of Memory" and her disciples, have their memories preserved and added to the collective. Nearly all "elves" in "Syngorn" receive this rite, and a vast number of "elves" who live elsewhere write into their wills that they must be subject to the rite after their death.

Wisps of violet light flit about the sequoia's ancient boughs, and those who look closely into their centers have been known to catch glimpses of eras past, troubles present, and things that yet may be. The great redwood and its spirits are watched and tended to by the Dreamweavers, "elves" who have dedicated their waking and sleeping lives to the protection of their heritage. About five hundred Dreamweavers and five thousand scholars, merchants, and other "elves" call this district their home.

The "elves" are a culture obsessed with tradition and the past. As such, the Dreamweavers are among the most well-respected factions within "Syngorn". Their leader, "Ouestra, the Voice of Memory", is likewise the most revered and socially powerful of the "Wardens".

##### Beryl Keep

This fortress-district houses the martial might of "Syngorn". Situated on a hill in the northwest of the city, thick walls of leaf-green beryl separate the district from the rest of the city. Within these walls are rows of barracks, archery ranges, trance chambers, forges, mess halls, and all the other necessities to train an army of long-lived "elves". At the far northwest of the district is the Beryl Keep itself. The near-unassailable fortress proves the saying that even the most utilitarian of elven things are beautiful to mortal eyes. Six eucalyptus trees of unknown age mark the boundaries of the keep, and between them grows a thick curtain of ironbark. A dense canopy of impenetrable steelfern forms its roof. Legend says that when "Syngorn's" need is greatest, the six ancient eucalyptus trees that guard the keep will uproot and march as mighty [treants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md) to defend the city.

Beryl Keep is commanded by "Verdant Lord Celindar", "Syngorn's" master strategist. He possesses a [crystal ball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/crystal-ball.md) of [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md) within his war room, which he can use to [scry](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) upon any part of the "Verdant Expanse" and to pierce any illusion. From this vantage point, he commands his forces like a chess master, always one step ahead of the threats within the enchanted forest. So far, "Syngorn" remains safe because its enemies are wild and disorganized. Were they to unify, the might of the Verdant Guard would truly be put to the test.

The armies of "Syngorn" are about five thousand "elves" strong, though only about three thousand are within this district at any time. The rest are stationed at outposts within the "Verdant Expanse" and the Fey Realm.

##### Tarn Ward

"Syngorn's" central ward is a peaceful commerce district surrounding Lake Ywynnlas and split by the channels that feed it. From sunrise to sunset, no business is conducted here, save for food service at public houses and beds at inns. During the daylight hours, "elves" socialize, play, sing songs, write poetry, paint great works of art, and meditate here. "Elves" are long-lived, and if half the day is not spent in peace and self-improvement, it is thought that the day was truly wasted, no matter how productive one might have been in matters of business.

At nightfall, however, the Tarn Ward changes. The Tarn Thoroughfare opens at moonrise, lit only by the heavens and by magical, floating lanterns. The streets are silent but for the ethereal elvensong that guides those who know how to listen through the streets. "Elves" and half-elves raised in "Syngorn" know this musical language, but those unfamiliar with it must use a [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md) spell to follow the melody. When the river of sound guides a customer to a vendor, they speak in hushed Elvish, like an audience whispering at the theatre.

Most shops along the Tarn Thoroughfare are affiliated with one of three guilds—the Spellbenders' Guild, the Elvencraft Alliance, or the Mithral Fellowship—and the sly "Guildrunner Rawndel" sits at the head of all three. The Warden of this district, Rawndel lives in a permanent [magnificent mansion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion.md) with a façade adorned with splendid fey grotesques, and is respected by elven merchants and nobles alike. The "elves" don't seem to mind his monopoly on Thoroughfare trade, as their lives haven't been affected much, but "High Warden Tirelda" worries of the long-term consequences of Rawndel's power-hungry behavior.

> [!note] Syngornian Goods
> 
> Any basic goods can be purchased in "Syngorn" at twice their usual cost. These goods, however, are of fine elven make. [Weapons have a +1 bonus to damage rolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md), horses and other mounts increase their movement speed by 10 feet, and other items are possessed of unearthly beauty and preternatural durability. All common magic items can be easily found here, and any uncommon magic item has a 50% chance chance of being found here in the ward's many market stalls. Finding magic items of greater rarity requires a character to make a DC 21 Charisma ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find a rare item, or a DC 25 ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find a very rare item. These items are rarely for sale, and can only be bartered for—typically by completing a dangerous quest for the person who possesses them.

##### Emerald Citadel

The great palace of "Syngorn" looms high over the north of the city—a mighty castle of faded white marble, now covered with climbing ivy and sprouting plants. As the highest point in the gradually sloping city, its emerald-tipped spires can be seen from anywhere below. Visitors to the citadel first climb a grand set of stairs, curved like a flowing river of marble, before reaching its brass gates. The Verdant Guard aggressively protects the castle's main entrance, rejecting any commoner who does not have an invitation to the palace marked with the High Warden's seal. "High Warden Tirelda's" monocled majordomo, a silver-haired elf named Ibbimas, screens all of the High Warden's supplicants.

The palace's high, vaulted ceilings are supported by pillars of gleaming marble carved in the image of tall elm trees, such that the ceilings are a canopy of polished stone. Beautiful portraits and busts of past "Wardens" line the walls, along with opulent tapestries of Yenlara and the creation of "Syngorn". The citadel is made up of four main levels. The basement levels hold the castle dungeons, as well as grand vaults containing fabulous treasure, historical artifacts, and overwrought gifts—the latter given by emissaries uncertain of how to present a gift fine enough for an elven monarch. The first floor holds lush quarters for ambassadors and visiting dignitaries. The second floor's chambers are dedicated to business of state, including the High Warden's throne room. The towers above the citadel contain studies and quarters for the High Warden and her family.

![An emerald peaked stone ci...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-emeraldcitadel.webp#center "An emerald peaked stone citadel stands grandly above a beautiful, sylvan stone path. It is surrounded by a grand white and gold gate within a thick forest canopy, several cloaked individuals guard the gate as another figure approaches.")

##### Feygrove

A once-splendid manor house in southern "Syngorn" is now completely overgrown with plant life. Massive mulberry trees sprout at odd angles out of windows and through gables, and fairy lights dance around the house at all hours of the day. When "Syngorn" returned from the Fey Realm after the "Conclave's" defeat, the "elves" unintentionally brought a little of the Fey Realm with them. A number of fey creatures slipped through a gate from the Fey Realm to Exandria, then wriggled through "Syngorn's" defenses and made their home in the mansion of an elven noblewoman named Lady Ladri Il'shavfa. She has tried for years to reclaim her home, but even the patience of "elves" wears thin; the fey are simply too numerous and too tenacious to be kicked out for good.

The fey interlopers, however, are having the time of their lives. Far from merely throwing nightly parties—though they do that, too—they have made Il'shavfa Manor a place for them to experiment with wild new magic. Their leader, a [pixie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) prince named Windybranch, has found great pleasure in planting strange fey plants in the house and watching as they integrate with the mansion. The house is now a living, breathing, thinking thing—a new friend for the fey! It keeps the "elves" out and it's a great conversationalist! To the fey, this arrangement has no downsides! The fairies have named this manor after the Archfey who first allowed them into the city. To them, their new home is Artagan's Lodge (and it's said that the Archfey Artagan occasionally stays within its walls when he visits Tal'Dorei).

Since the Feygrove was first "founded" over twenty years ago, the fey have spilled out of Il'shavfa Manor and made an entire district of the city into their home. By this point, only the most stubborn of elven nobility still gripe about "the fey menace" within their midst. Most of "Syngorn's" residents are delighted to have a district filled with the fey, even if it causes the southern end of the city to be a little more chaotic than usual. The fey here seem to have kind hearts, and their chaos rarely crosses the line from churlish pranks into cruelty.

##### Reverie Walks

The artistic and spiritual center of "Syngorn" is a winding labyrinth of living trees and stones. "Elves" who seek a day-long (or days-long) journey of meditation may wander the Reverie Walks, entering a trance-like state as they do so. Those who seek true enlightenment may dedicate years of their near-immortal lives to wandering the ever-shifting labyrinth, finding peace in isolation or in search of the Stone of the Arch Heart in the labyrinth's center. An elven monk named Lyssev Sorveline has walked the labyrinth for five hundred years, seeking answers to questions even the gods do not know. Some "elves" leave gifts of food for the Wanderer within the labyrinth, allowing them to continue their eternal meditation in peace.

No Warden holds sway over the Reverie Walks. Legend holds that the living stones and trees that shift the labyrinth are devotees of the Arch Heart that swore to be their god's eternal wardens.

#### Points of Interest

"Syngorn" has a number of famous landmarks. They are keyed to the map of "Syngorn".

![A map of the elven city of...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-syngornmap.webp#center "A map of the elven city of Syngorn showing the neighborhoods and wards that surround Lake Ywnnlas.")

##### 1. Elvencraft Alliance Guildhall

The Elvencraft Alliance is supposedly the oldest guild in "Syngorn". They are entrusted with creating works of art that spread the culture of "Syngorn" far and wide across Tal'Dorei. The front rooms of their guildhall are a museum of fine elven crafts from ages past, and they're open to all who wish to appreciate "Syngorn's" cultural heritage.

##### 2. Guildrunner's Mansion

"Guildrunner Rawndel", Warden of the Tarn Ward, makes his home within a permanent [magnificent mansion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion.md). Its exterior is a magnificent façade of stone and leering fey statues, yet if one were to look inside, they would find it completely empty. The door, which is constantly locked to all but the Guildrunner and his guests, is actually a portal to an extradimensional space containing a manor of supernatural beauty and luxury.

##### 3. Mithral Fellowship Guildhall

The master metallurgists and smiths of the Mithral Fellowship are tasked with arming the Verdant Guard and the armies of "Syngorn". In peacetime, they turn their talents to creating things of beauty from metal and jewels, sometimes in tandem with the artists of the Elvencraft Alliance. Due to their military involvement, none but authorized members of the fellowship are allowed within their guildhall.

##### 4. One Thousand Steps

This winding stair is the only way in or out of the "Memory Ward". Each step is inscribed with an ancient elven idiom, aphorism, or impossible philosophical question. Anyone who enters the "Memory Ward" is told to read the aphorism upon the first step and ponder it the entire time they are climbing the stairway. If they find peace in their answer, they are to read the inscription of the second step on their next journey, and so on. There are few, even among the "elves", who have pondered the inscriptions of all of the steps to their satisfaction.

##### 5. Spires of Yurek

Roads lined with dormitories and vendors radiate out from the branches of the Sequoia of Remembrance to the walls of the "Memory Ward", providing essentials for not only the Dreamweavers, but the elven scholars who teach, study, and experiment with magic within the Spires of Yurek. This academy was named for "Yurek Windkeeper", founder of the "Arcana Pansophical" and personal counselor to the "Voice of Memory" herself. The school is small compared to "Emon's" magnificent "Alabaster Lyceum", but its seven marble towers are no less awe-inspiring. Characters who visit the Spires of Yurek can learn any historical fact by studying its tomes for one hour and then making a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check. They can even uncover hints toward long-lost secrets by completing a day's study and then succeeding on a DC 25 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check. New spells are constantly being invented here, and countless tomes filled with ancient spells can be found within the libraries.

##### 6. Tower of Moonlight

Most visitors to "Syngorn" doubt that "Ouestra, the Voice of Memory", truly dwells in a tower of moonlight. It is the truth. Her tower does not exist under the light of the sun, and then appears as a semi-solid pillar of Catha's silvery glow, occasionally veined by lines of Ruidus's ruddy light when the smaller moon is full. Its inside has supposedly never been seen by any but the other "Wardens of Syngorn", and a thousand rumors circulate throughout the realm of the magical and divine marvels that must be contained within.

##### 7. Spellbenders' Guildhall

The "Verdant Expanse" is saturated with magic. The ley energies that suffuse the greenwood make it easy for arcanists to create works of spellcraft by themselves, when it might take a half-dozen mages working in concert in other lands. Many of "Syngorn's" most trustworthy magi are members of the Spellbenders, a guild dedicated to creating new spells and using them to create works of art, defend their homeland, and improve their peoples' lives. Their guildhall is only accessible to those with the express permission of "Guildrunner Rawndel".

##### 8. Stone of the Arch Heart

In the heart of the Reverie Walks is a column of pure diamond, carved in the radiant likeness of an androgynous elf. Though the Arch Heart is worshiped throughout Tal'Dorei as a god of magic and art, they are something more to the "elves" of "Syngorn": a progenitor of their people, a deity of fatherhood and motherhood, yet also of neither—a liminal god that by their very nature both embraces and destroys binaries. "Elves" that are "born of the Arch Heart" are honored within "Syngorn", and many who seek that honor wander the Reverie Ward in search of the Stone, longing for physical transformation, social power, or arcane might. Some search for centuries and never find it, but in times of peril, the Arch Heart always makes their wisdom known to those who truly need it.

##### The River Does Not Run Through It (low-level)

Word arrives from Verdant Scouts that the Feshun River has stopped emptying into the Ozmit Sea without warning. The powerful flow from the "Tormor Falls" shows no signs of dwindling river flow, so the party is sent to investigate, only to find a sudden sinkhole that has consumed a small section of the "Expanse", causing the river to pour into this massive, underground cavern. The rock and earth below appears to be crumbling at an accelerated pace, and the air below smells of decay. What could be the source of this rapid destruction, and how can it be remedied?

### Tormor Falls

Feeding the mouth of the rushing Feshun River that carves through the body of the "Expanse", Tormor Falls is an incredible multi-level series of waterfalls that cascade down the eastern side of Orencleft Mountain for hundreds of feet. Swelling with every major rainfall, and beautiful to behold at all times of the year, Tormor Falls is also host to a number of caves that hide beneath the mist and spray, leading beyond the forest and under the "Stormcrest Mountains".

A squad of Verdant Guard patrols the base of the falls, and many have explored the caverns in the past. Some return with nothing; others discover old relics and trinkets from the earliest days of Tal'Dorei, or even from the time of the "Calamity". It's rare for a patrol to fail to return, but when they do, no search party has ever been able to make contact with survivors, or to reclaim their remains. The guard has begun to whisper that the cave entrances move, shifting with each rising sun. The superstitions surrounding the caves around Tormor Falls have grown so great that expeditions which fail to return are no longer searched for at all, and no patrols go inside the caves without a critically important reason.

##### This Cave Was Made for Me! (mid-level)

Characters that travel the edge of the "Verdant Expanse" hear distressing news that people from small villages, and even from "Syngorn", have disappeared in the night—and now, a friend of the party has joined the ranks of the missing. What they don't know is that these people are leaving the village themselves, hypnotically drawn to the caves behind "Tormor Falls" by an [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) living within a pool deep inside the cave system. The beings that emerge from those caves are no longer humanoid, but nightmarish mockeries of life.

### Vues'dal Waters

- **Scattered Villages.** Population 2,420 (52% "elves", 28% "goblinkin", 12% "lizardfolk", 5% "humans", 3% "other races")  

The volcano known as Mt. Vues'dal erupted for the last time in the early days of the "Age of Arcanum". Its explosion shook the earth so terribly that the mountain itself was swallowed, creating the Vues'dal Basin at the edge of the "Stormcrest Mountains". Today, the basin has been completely filled by the Feshun River, and the land around the Vues'dal Basin is among the most fertile farmland in southern Tal'Dorei. The villages of the Vues'dal Waters are known for their prize produce, exporting tomatoes, cherries, pumpkins, lentils, sweet potatoes, and dozens of other foods, both staples and luxuries, to "Syngorn"—and from there, to the rest of Tal'Dorei.

The people of the Vues'dal Waters are mostly "elves", but over the years they've been joined by some of the local [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) that have dwelt in the marshes, as well as goblinkin fleeing the "Iron Authority" to the south. All of these various people have banded together to create something beautiful around the caldera of this long-dead volcano—and to repel bandits and monsters from the nearby marshes. The [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) hate fighting their kin, but human and [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) bandits alike have made the wetlands their home, and prey upon these honest farmers from encampments that shift from week to week.

##### Legions of the Reptile God (mid-level)

The people of Vues'dal have unwittingly been skirmishing with the vanguard of a force that wishes to bring "Syngorn" to its knees. The [spirit naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/spirit-naga.md) Maledicta Hexos has come from below the "Stormcrest Mountains" to rally the [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) tribe in the name of the Cloaked Serpent. Vues'dal will soon be overrun, and the Verdant Guard has called for "Emon's" aid in driving back the legions of this monster with delusions of godhood.

Maledicta's armies contain not just countless [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md), but also several [hydras](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md), and a [night hag](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) that serves as her lieutenant. Maledicta is also in possession of one of the "Astural Scrolls", an artifact looted from "Wrettis" that grants her uncanny cosmic powers.

## Bladeshimmer Shoreline

The Bladeshimmer Shoreline, named for the distant glimmering of sun across the Ozmit Sea, stretches across the central western coast of Tal'Dorei. This coast is where "humans", "halflings", and "gnomes" first set foot on the continent of Tal'Dorei, and it bears the marks of their first steps on this land. It's also home to the present heart of the Republic of Tal'Dorei.

The shoreline is a hub of international trade, for the western coast of Tal'Dorei is closest to the continents of "Issylra" and "Marquet". Dozens of tallmasted trading ships set sail to and from its calm shores each day—as well as the majestic [skyships](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) that daily soar in and out of the resplendent capital city of "Emon".

Inland Bladeshimmer is mostly temperate grassland, intercut by cool, winding rivers. The bulk of western Tal'Dorei's produce comes from farms here, blessed with clean water and non-salinated soil, despite the ocean's proximity. "Emon's" presence lends the region stability. Nevertheless, the yeomen living beyond the city's walls struggle to defend their small plots from burrowing [ankhegs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ankheg.md), corrupting fiends, and the various folkloric spirits and monsters that lurk in the shadows of their minds.

### Daggerbay

Daggerbay, so named for the jagged Slumber Reef that flanks the bay, was where the first human colonists of Tal'Dorei made landfall. In that bygone time, it was a bustling port for the human city of Port "O'Noa". It has since fallen into disuse after the "Scattered War" and the destruction of "O'Noa". Centuries later, the bay is now naught but a haunting reminder of darker days. It is home to hundreds of sunken ships and the bodies of their lost crew, deep below the depths of the reef. Those who know of their history say that the waters are cursed, and the nearby settlers spread rumors of ghost ships and [sirens](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/siren-tftyp.md) calling looters to their grave should they wander too close to the ominous waves.

A society of banished [merfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/merfolk.md) have claimed "Daggerbay" as their domain. They harass any treasure hunters that seek to loot the wreckage at the bottom of the bay. While the characters are traveling nearby, a terrible storm forces them to take shelter in the ruins of "Daggerbay".

In truth, the storm was caused by the renegade [merfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/merfolk.md). Some weeks ago, they discovered a relic of the Stormlord with the power to summon and direct storms. The coast is now shrouded in an endless maelstrom. That night, when the characters take shelter in the ruins, they're assailed by the [merfolks'](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/merfolk.md) land-dwelling humanoid thugs. These brutes attempt to capture the characters and deliver them to their leaders.

### Daggerbay Mountains

The pages of history do not remember the Molten Titan, or when this fierce entity of liquid metal was felled by primordial "elves" at the end of the "Founding". The entity was sealed within and consumed by the earth, giving birth to a range of mountains that has stood for the ages since. Jutting upward against the northwestern border of the "Verdant Expanse" and stretching to the Ozmit Sea, these stormy peaks functioned as the first boundary between the long-established "elves" of "Syngorn" and the burgeoning human colonies on Tal'Dorei during their arrival.

For most of history, the "Daggerbay Mountains", or the lyren'alsi in Elvish, were known to be desolate and devoid of material worth. Prospectors from "O'Noa" came home empty-handed, if they came back at all. The survivors returned with tales of bands of bloodthirsty, one-eyed giants that roamed the peaks: [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md). "Issylran" settlers and "Syngornian" "elves" both learned to leave the lyren'alsi well enough alone.

Decades later, the "Emerald Outpost" was established as a major trading post for the people of "Emon" and "Syngorn". With such a valuable settlement nearby, the "Daggerbay's" hazardous peaks suddenly garnered the interest of adventurers and fortune-seekers. Small hunts for undiscovered riches grew into vast expeditions. These incursions into the mountains aggravated the mountains' territorial inhabitants; elven scouts reported [cyclops](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) raiders and [cyclops stormcallers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops-stormcaller-tdcsr.md) conducting strange rituals within the eyes of thunderstorms at night, and hungry [bulettes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) hunting beyond their normal domain, as if guided by some unknown intelligence.

#### Daggerbay Mountains Adventures

Game Masters who set their adventure in the "Daggerbay Mountains" can use these plot hooks for inspiration.

##### Eye of the Storm (mid-level)

Groups of [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) are migrating into the mountains, leaving their foothill settlements empty of warriors, civilians, and the infirm alike. A half-elf [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) named Thunderchaser has caused a stir in the "Emerald Outpost" by bringing back the lightning-charred corpse of a [hill giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) with one eye ritually gouged out. What are the [cyclops stormcallers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops-stormcaller-tdcsr.md) planning beneath the concealing stormclouds of the "Daggerbay Mountains"?

##### A Metal of Memory (high-level)

The ancient molten beast that was sundered beneath these rocky peaks left behind pockets, located far below the surface, of an incredibly rare metal with mysterious properties, called orichalcum. The sudden discovery has sent local entrepreneurs into a frenzy, and the ensuing rush has already sparked violence among the bands of treasure hunters. As the adventuring parties dig deeper, they discover that some essence of the ancient creature still lives, and it is seeking vengeance.

### Emerald Outpost

- **Town.** Population 1,470 (76% "elves", 19% "humans", 3% "halflings", 2% "other races")  

Originally established by the "elves" of "Syngorn" as a hidden outpost to protect their homeland from the growing empire of "Drassig", the "Emerald Outpost" fell out of use after the "Scattered War". This former military outpost is now an intermediary trading post and a place for merchants traveling between "Emon" and "Syngorn" to rest. The Emerald Chambers, once used as a war room, and more recently used as a diplomatic chamber for the allied governments of "Emon" and "Syngorn", have these days been converted into a stylish bazaar, in which "Emonian" and "Syngornian" traders can sell their wares without making the full journey to either city.

### Emon, the City of Fellowship

- **Metropolis.** Population 365,026 (63% "humans", 8% "dwarves", 7% "elves", 22% "other races")  

"Emon" stands defiantly against all who would threaten Tal'Dorei and its people. It is the cultural and political heart of the Republic of Tal'Dorei, as well as a nexus of commerce, entertainment, travel, education, and adventure.

"Emon" is accessible only through its heavily patrolled gates and by [skyship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md). The denizens of the city are generally well protected from outside attackers and sieges.

#### Government

"Emon" is the seat of the "Tal'Dorei Council", the nation's highest governing body. Though the council originally served under the Sovereign of Tal'Dorei, the nation's final sovereign was killed when the "Chroma Conclave" attacked "Emon". Following the death of "Thordak the Cinder King" and the rest of the "Conclave", "Emon" was rebuilt and the council reformed as the backbone of the new Republic of Tal'Dorei. The council and its members are "described in detail starting on page 42."

One unintended consequence of relying on magic to rapidly rebuild "Emon" is that the mages of Tal'Dorei now hold incredible influence over the fledgling council. Some fear that without a sovereign, the council will be unable to keep the arcanists in line, and Tal'Dorei will dissolve into magocracy.

#### Current Events

The "Tal'Dorei Council" is best known for their policies that affect the whole of Tal'Dorei. It is often ignored that the council also governs "Emon" and resolves the day-to-day issues of the city. These are some current events both great and small affecting "Emon" today; these topics can add flavor to the discussions and rumors the characters hear around town, and could even inspire new adventures for them to take on.

##### Elemental Disturbances

Over twenty years have passed since "Thordak the Cinder King" was killed in the caverns beneath "Emon". His wreckage in the "Cloudtop District", as well as the "Scar of the Cinder King", a swath of elemental destruction outside the city walls, have been tended to by members of the Fire "Ashari", gradually healing the stubborn wounds of his influence. Yet the primordial fires that seeped from his body continue to linger in the caverns beneath the city where he died. Every year or two, an incursion of wild fire and hateful [cinderslag elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cinderslag-elemental-tdcsr.md) burst through the city streets, causing mass chaos, expensive damages, and life-or-death battles for the city guard.

##### Mercenary Mages

A generation ago, the fledgling "League of Miracles" hired hundreds, if not thousands, of mercenary mages to aid in the reconstruction of "Emon" and other cities across Tal'Dorei. These days, Tal'Dorei is rebuilt, and the few infrastructure problems aren't enough to employ all the mercenaries left behind by the league. These out-of-work mercenaries now linger around dismal dive bars and make trouble for the locals. Most people would rather see them gone, but it's hard not to feel sorry for their situation.

##### Walls and Slums

The city's outer walls have fallen under heavy criticism from politicians and civilians alike in recent years. Many people are concerned that the walls' true purpose these days is to separate the slums outside the walls from the "respectable" districts within them. Popular opinion is now that the great "City of Fellowship" should do more to help its less fortunate, but council politicians continue to stall. In private, Master of Commerce [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) de Rolo fumes that she wants to help, but can't cut through political red tape with her [legendary bow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/fenthras-tdcsr.md) and arrow.

#### Society

While in antiquity "Emon" was the heart of a human empire, the city has grown to encompass people from all over Tal'Dorei, and all over the world. Its citizens include people of nearly all known races from Exandria's many nations, thriving on the new innovations and ideas of its citizenry. It has been this way since the sovereignty of "Zan Tal'Dorei", when the alliances she formed invited dozens of displaced "elves", "dwarves", "orcs", and "goliaths" into her city. Since then, "Emon" has developed into a city whose people valued innovation and collaboration, especially in small, cohesive groups—virtues that some historians within the "Alabaster Lyceum" believe have given rise to the prominence of the modern adventuring party.

While "Emon" is becoming more commercial and the use of [gold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gold.md) as currency has been ubiquitous throughout Tal'Dorei's history, many communities within the city are still close-knit enough to use the barter system. During the reign of "Drassig", the "humans" of "Emon" adopted a dwarven oath called rudraz, an intimate promise between two people to repay a deed or trade. Though the rudraz is not a contract, the "dwarves" believed that an oathbreaker would be forever barred from passing beyond the Brightguard Gates of Hilmaire, the gates that allow "dwarves" to pass to the afterlife. "Humans" in "Emon" treat the rudraz more lightly, often using it to seal matters of business or politics rather than personal promises, but breaking this oath still carries massive social repercussions. Few look kindly upon a person with the epithet "Oathbreaker".

#### Rebirth

"Emon" has mostly recovered from its destruction at the talons of the "Chroma Conclave" and "Thordak's" subsequent occupation. A number of Tal'Dorei's most significant factions played a role in "Emon's" rebirth, and their members enjoy positions of prominence throughout the city. "Emon" was rapidly rebuilt to its former glory, due to the expensive but effective intervention of mercenary mages serving the "League of Miracles". Thanks also to the "Clasp's" underground networks and established hierarchies, "Emonian" society and culture was able to bounce back more swiftly than any other major settlement in Tal'Dorei.

And the "Tal'Dorei Council", formerly an advisory council to the sovereign, is now the ruling council of the land. Folk heroes and career politicians alike sit on the council. Over the past two decades, the council has, with many missteps, enacted the will of the people—allowing Tal'Dorei to transition from a monarchical power to a republic without war or insurrection.

However, the swiftness of "Emon's" rebirth has put the "Tal'Dorei Council" in a precarious position. Not only are they socially indebted to a criminal faction—one whose members now command immense celebrity among the common folk—the council now owes vast amounts of gold to mages of the "League of Miracles". League conjurers created thousands of tons of stone and steel, and each one of their transmuters rebuilt everything from taverns to townhouses and sewers to stately manors as quickly as a hundred laborers. "Thordak's" hoard of plundered wealth has dwindled to nothing, repaying the league, and they have done the same in cities across the land. Some members of the council have already caved to pressure from factions within the "Clasp" and the "League of Miracles", and subsequently turn a blind eye to the crime and magical abuse that run rampant throughout the city. Barely a single human generation old, the young republic is already struggling under the weight of ruling in a just and noble manner.

#### Defenses

The Republic of Tal'Dorei has no standing army, and doesn't elect a Master of War—a military commander-in-chief—to its council outside of wartime. In peacetime, the Master of Defense is responsible for the acquisition of mercenaries and adventurers for tasks which require the use of force. They also have the ability to conscript existing militias and town guards into military service and call them to "Emon's" defense at any time, though typically only while the Master of War is being elected.

The only standing forces pledged exclusively to the defense of the realm are the elite forces of "Fort Daxio". Mobilizing the armies of "Fort Daxio" to "Emon's" aid generally requires the city to withstand a week-long siege. However, in case of internal strife, there are stables positioned every fifteen miles along the Othen Trail, allowing Daxio's legendary outriders to arrive at "Emon" in a mere two days' time by switching out their exhausted steeds.

"Emon" is encircled by 60-foot-high stone walls that stretch from the eastern fields to the western shore—though a number of discussions in the "Tal'Dorei Council" have revolved around the strategic irrelevance of great stone walls. They didn't protect "Emon" against the "Chroma Conclave" over twenty years ago, and they wouldn't have done much against an army of [cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) and winged [gloomstalkers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gloomstalker-egw.md) had The Whispered One led an army against Tal'Dorei. As [skyships](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) grow more popular and affordable around the world, even the council's Master of Defense is considering demolishing the city's walls—making the strange case that such fortifications are prized more for their historic and cultural value than for their strategic importance.

These walls are patrolled by lightly armed and armored members of the Arms of Emon, the city's official watch and constabulary. They are divided unofficially into the Arms upon the Wall and the Arms on the Streets, the latter of which are assigned to patrol the city streets to dissuade petty criminals and respond to violent crime.

#### Crime

Hundreds of miles of tunnels of varied provenance run beneath "Emon". Most are the forgotten remnants of paved-over neighborhoods and secret passageways made by thieves' guilds during the reign of "Drassig". Others are the lairs of tunneling monsters. The origins of others still are lost forever, for they have already long since been turned into sewer passages to whisk away the refuse of "Emon's" citizens.

The vast majority of the tunnels closer to the surface are known to the "Clasp" and used to rapidly move about the city unseen. Somewhere deep in this network of unlabeled roads is the "Clasp's" secret headquarters, where all manner of thieves, [cutthroats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/clasp-cutthroat-tdcsr.md), fences, and spies gather beneath their banner. Though the "Clasp" operates in major cities across Tal'Dorei, "Emon" has always been their home, and saving their neighbors from "Thordak's" reign of terror gave the "Clasp" the dubious benefit of a heroic reputation.

However, the "Myriad" crime syndicate from "Wildemount" has spent over two decades relentlessly clawing their way into the "Clasp's" territory across Tal'Dorei—dismantling their networks, poaching their clients, and assassinating their informants. The "Myriad" hasn't managed to completely eliminate the "Clasp's" hold in any of the cities they've targeted, but that hasn't stopped them from bringing the ongoing power struggle to the "Clasp's" doorstep. "Myriad" agents bargain in shadowed alleys, gamble in upscale taverns, and lurk in the very tunnels that the "Clasp" relies on, waiting for their chance to unseat the "Clasp" once and for all.

#### Geography and Climate

"Emon" is not a tourist destination for its climate—the city is known for sudden, pounding rainstorms just as much as for its beautiful, sunny days. The city is blessed with cool summers and warm winters, thanks to its proximity to the cool Ozmit Sea. Though snow rarely falls on the city itself, it relies on springtime snowmelt from the "Cliffkeep Mountains" to fill its reservoirs throughout the year.

"Emon" is made up of the following districts:

##### Abdar's Promenade

The Promenade is an open marketplace district and massive bazaar that dominates eastern "Emon", named for the legendary spicemonger from "Marquet" who helped fund the construction of "Emon". To this day, the name of Abdar is synonymous with both generosity and business savvy. Nearly everything a person could want can be found within the tents, carts, warehouses, and shops of the promenade. Its intertwining roads stretch for miles, and it has dozens of tiny neighborhoods, each with their own distinct cultures and identities. The promenade is heavily patrolled by the Arms of Emon, for its sunny reputation is shrouded by an equally significant reputation for literal back-alley criminal deals.

##### Central District

This is the largest residential district within "Emon's" walls. It houses most of the city's merchant class, including traveling traders, ship captains, and guild journeymen. The Central District is a patchwork of thousands of personal homes, tenements, and guildhalls of all shapes and sizes, peppered with small taverns and inns on nearly every street corner.

These neighborhoods lay clustered together among tightly set streets, occasionally broken up by park grasses or the Ozmit Waterways that snake through the region between the promenade and the port. Visitors to the Central District are advised not to go out at night; the wide disparity of wealth from home to home here has seen a recent rise in crime, and the city watch seems reluctant to find a constructive solution. Residents who know the lay of the land have an easier time at night and can help visitors avoid the most dangerous streets.

##### Cloudtop District

Out of all of "Emon's" districts, the Cloudtop has, in some ways, changed the most over the decades. In "Drassig's" time, a monstrous fortress loomed over the manors of his sycophants. In the age of "Zan Tal'Dorei's" descendants, countless mages transfigured that decadent citadel into a sleek, elegant palace. By the time the "Chroma Conclave" came, decadence had once more crept up on "Emon", and though the Palace of the Sovereign remained much the same, the Cloudtop District was once again a nest of luxury and the throne of the social elite. The latest additions in that era were [skyship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) platforms, so that the wealthiest and most connected in Tal'Dorei could travel in exclusive luxury—soaring through the skies rather than enduring arduous journeys over land or sea.

All of that was reduced to slag by the advent of the "Cinder King". "Thordak" made the Cloudtop District his home, and the palace itself his throne. His very presence caused magma to surge from the caverns beneath "Emon", where previously no fires burned. "Thordak" ruled there for only a matter of months, but those few months were enough to annihilate unknown millions of gold pieces' worth of art and creations of untold value—though the greedy dragon took care to command his minions to save the most beautiful works for his treasure hoard.

Today, the Cloudtop District is rebuilt, though the most stubborn elemental influences of the "Cinder King" linger in "Thordak's Crater". A new castle called "Cloudwatch Palace" has been built atop the city of "Emon", and it contains the chambers of the "Tal'Dorei Council", as well as grand dining halls and guest quarters for visiting dignitaries. Much of the castle is a museum, displaying what regalia and objets d'art survived the wrath of the "Cinder King". The private chambers of the palace also contain a number of [teleportation circles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) that leading councilmembers can use to return to their homes at night—particularly if they live in far-off cities such as "Whitestone".

##### Temple District

Some say that this northern district contains more temples than in the rest of Tal'Dorei's cities combined. This is a flagrant exaggeration, but at first glance, most people believe it. "Emon" is a city of many people, from many different places, with many different faiths. Even folk who worship the same gods worship them differently, and have built their own temples. Legend has it that shrines and temples used to be built all across "Emon" (and there are still some small sanctuaries elsewhere in the city), but a cleric of the Dawnfather declared her temple the greatest in all "Emon". Her boast was met with scorn from a nearby church of the Stormlord. Their clerics, always eager to rise to a challenge, built an even greater temple across the street, and soon, people of all faiths were building the most magnificent structures they could, all in one tiny corner of "Emon".

Today, cathedrals to the Lawbearer and the Platinum Dragon stand at apex among smaller temples to the Dawnfather, the Stormlord, the Wildmother, and the Matron of Ravens. All "Prime Deities" have at least a moderately sized house of worship here, and even some of the "Betrayer Gods" are worshiped in secrecy.

Anyone who seeks shelter here, be they rich or poor, can find sanctuary in the Temple District. Even the faithful of gods of strength, such as the Stormlord and the Platinum Dragon, have mercy for those who need the aid of others to help them stand on their own.

Travelers and sailors come to leave tokens and gifts at shrines to bless their journeys, while people of all walks of life seek the graces of the Changebringer before undertaking risky endeavors. The meek search for wisdom in the great halls of the Knowing Mentor, as the artists and wistful folk give praise to the Arch Heart. However, not all folk are drawn toward religion, nor trusting of it, and temples past have been exposed as frauds—or worse, cults who venerate power.

Recently, an off-kilter faith to a lesser idol called the Traveler has found purchase in the Temple Ward—primarily in the form of puerile graffiti in back alleys. Other quasi-religious spiritual entities have small cult followings in the Temple Ward. They are generally allowed to flourish to whatever degree they can, so long as their beliefs don't advocate for any behavior that would break the laws of "Emon".

##### Erudite Quarter

This district is home to members of the educated upper-middle class and destitute academics alike. Several institutions of higher learning have their stately campuses here, ranging from well-to-do boarding schools to Tal'Dorei's most premiere academic and arcane institutions.

Beautiful towers in ancient "Syngornian" style stretch to the sky across a cityscape of centuries-old halls of learning and student boardinghouses. Here, the finest schools and colleges draw the wealthy, the gifted, and the brilliant—and none more so than the "Alabaster Lyceum", often lauded as the largest and most accomplished institute of arcane study on the continent. Though the district's walls were shattered and its libraries crushed during the invasion of the "Chroma Conclave", the Erudite Quarter has thankfully been mostly reconstructed, thanks to the efforts of the "Lyceum's" staff and students.

Members of the "Lyceum", under the direction of Headmaster Thurmond Adlam, performed the reconstruction themselves not simply because they sought to project an image of good work ethic and self-sufficiency, but because the heads of their colleges distrust the "League of Miracles". Their motives and sources of funding are, in the eyes of the "Lyceum", too opaque to be trusted. Their suspicion has often been derided either as elitism over the diverse array of mercenary mages the league hires, or as sour grapes over losing out on countless lucrative reconstruction contracts.

##### Military District

Since "Emon" has no standing army, the Military District is one of the city's smallest wards. Nevertheless, it has the capacity to house and train a vast number of soldiers if an army needs to be levied from the people of Tal'Dorei. The Military District is mostly filled with several prisons and jails, including the infamous "Black Bastille", as well as tightly locked barracks and instructional facilities for the Arms of Emon.

##### Cemetery District

This smaller section of the city is filled with graveyards and small religious sanctuaries so that people with means to purchase a gravesite or a mausoleum can bury their dead in whatever luxury they can afford. Countless gravestones line the rolling hills of the district. They are sectioned off from the roads by tall iron fences, with mausoleums of more affluent families dotting the grassy hillsides. As surface space grew limited in centuries past, the city excavated a network of catacombs called the Undervaults. Upkeep, expansion, and general safeguarding of the sites are all overseen by the Gravewatchers, a guild of gravekeepers that have held political and social hegemony over the district for generations.

Their attempts to expand the Undervaults have had mixed results over the centuries. Most new excavations meet without incident (likely because the "Clasp" has learned to keep their tunnels far from this district). However, excavations in recent decades have broken into the "Crystalfen Caverns", an eerie cave system filled with mind-bending inscriptions and horrific beings. The breach was promptly sealed off.

Yet the sealing of the caverns did not stop some members of the Gravewatchers from seeing an opportunity to gain fame and glory. Most who ventured into the caverns were never seen again, and those who have returned shudder unspeakably of the horrors they escaped. Still, passage is occasionally granted to the "Clasp" or adventurers willing to pay the Gravewatchers for entry to the dangerous realm below.

##### Port of Emon

"Emon" is bordered on the west by the Ozmit Sea and is generally sheltered from the worst of its storms. The vast "Port of Emon" allows hundreds of thousands of gold pieces' worth of goods to flow through the city every single day. Well over a hundred ships fill this port at any given time, and the dock crews are ever working, carrying crates and goods away to "Abdar's Promenade", or to empty vessels for exportation. The northern sector of the Port is mostly allocated to the Everline, a powerful fisherfolk's guild. They frequently feud with the Onyx Banner, "Emon's" most powerful shipping guild, over which docks they are permitted to use. Both guilds keep their hands clean, but it's an open secret that both hire adventurers and mercenaries to trash the other's ships and warehouses to intimidate them. Adventurers in need of fast cash who don't mind dodging the Arms of "Emon" can find good work as muscle for either of these two guilds.

![The Port of Emon where sev...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-portofemon.webp#center "The Port of Emon where several ships on the water approach the gleaming, colorful city in the distance. A beautiful, tall castle stands far in the background, overlooking the city.")

##### Outwall

During the reign of "Drassig", a massive city of tents and hovels grew outside of "Emon", filled with those too poor to pay "Drassig's" extortative taxes. By the end of the "Scattered War", the slum had grown to a third of the city's size, and nearly half its population. Even during the reign of "Zan Tal'Dorei", these slums continued to grow, as refugees of the "Scattered War" tried to earn enough money to find stability within "Emon's" walls.

Though their conditions were still meager when the magnanimous "Zan Tal'Dorei" ended "Drassig's" iron rule, the city's denizens chose to remain, having created a community with its own culture of inexpensive living and brotherhood in poverty, away from the bustle of the city's inner streets. A microcosm of "Emonian" society now exists within the city of Outwall, including its own trade square, shrines for worship, and makeshift farms on the outskirts. As early as two decades ago, Outwall was called the Upper Slums—a derogatory name given to it by "Emon's" Cloudtop elite. People within Outwall tried to transform the term "Upper Slums" into a symbol of civic pride, but it never stuck. The name Outwall eventually emerged after community leaders demanded an audience with the "Tal'Dorei Council" in an event that came to be called the Outer Wall Debates—for they demanded the council convene in the slums' own town square.

These days, Outwall is becoming a trendy place to live, thanks to its vibrant culture and relatively inexpensive housing. Its locals are fighting hard to keep young people with money to burn from the "Central District" from gentrifying their home. It hasn't come to violence yet, but the angrier members of the Outwall community clandestinely meet with adventurers to burn down the stylish houses and mansions that are driving out local residents and businesses.

##### Southgate Farms

Inspired by the civic action of the people of "Outwall", the farmers of Southgate were able to break from the ugly name of "slum" in the past decade. This community of farmers and ranchers, formerly known as the Lower Slum, exists outside "Emon's" southern gates. It first formed when a large refugee band from "Othanzia" was barred entry into the city in the midst of the "Scattered War". Instead of dispersing, they decided to lay down roots while "Drassig's" armies were out fighting a losing battle against "Zan Tal'Dorei". These squatters eventually formed a community of farmers who petitioned "Zan Tal'Dorei" for land in exchange for providing produce and grown goods to the people of the city.

Thanks to the aid of the First Sovereign, the descendants of those "Othanzian" refugees have become one of the most significant sources of fresh food for the people of "Emon". Frustrated by being saddled with the name of "slum," and inspired by the Outer Wall Debates, the leading families of the Lower Slums demanded recognition by the "Tal'Dorei Council" as well. They were met with little debate, and these humble farmers are now a respectable part of "Emonian" society—even if they live outside the city's defensive walls.

This southern region of the city is also home to a famous site of modern history: Greyskull Keep, the former base of operations for Vox Machina in "Emon". This fortress was gifted to them by the Last Sovereign as thanks for saving his life. The various heroes of Vox Machina have moved on to other homes (and now typically gather in "Whitestone" for holidays), and they allowed the keep to be turned into a museum of their heroic exploits.

##### Shoreline Farms

Less respectable than the "Southgate Farms" are the communities along a stretch of murky shore north of "Emon". These people of "Outwall" have tried for decades to turn terrible, salty land into effective farmland, to mixed results. They have successfully cultivated the few vegetables that grow in saltwater-soaked soil, leading to bountiful harvests of savory quattet gourds and the hard-to-grow brineroot. However, the farms' distance from the city gives them little protection from dangers that city folk think little of. Adventurers are always wanted to protect the farms from petty criminals and wandering monsters, but the farmers have little to pay. Generally, only utterly novice adventurers find their start in a place like the Shoreline Farms—but all heroes have to start somewhere.

##### The Grotto

This sprawling series of underground chambers composes the "Clasp's" headquarters beneath the city of "Emon". It's rumored that over a dozen entrances to the Grotto are concealed amidst the labyrinthine tunnels, which are both naturally occurring and a part of "Emon's" sewers. That doesn't even begin to get into the hundreds of other entrances and access shafts abandoned and filled in for fear of discovery. The very nature of the "Clasp's" business is to keep shifting out of sight, and as such, the actual core of the organization moves from base to base between multiple subterranean structures, ever building further underground, or repurposing a long-abandoned hideout whenever necessary.

#### Points of Interest

A number of both popular and historically significant landmarks can be found in "Emon". They are keyed to the map of "Emon".

![A map of Emon: The City of...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-emonmap.webp#center "A map of Emon: The City of Fellowship along the Ozmit Sea coastline, detailing the city's many districts, with the port on the Ozmit Sea to the west and its castle directly in the middle of the city. Channels and waterways wind throughout the city, circling towards the north.")

##### 1. Laughing Lamia Inn

While the city is home to countless taverns and inns for the weary traveler or practiced performer, few are as grand and well known as the Laughing Lamia. Almost as old as the city itself, this fine establishment has traded hands numerous times over the years, and has expanded with each transition, leaving the massive, four-story institution a hodgepodge mass of odd rooms and themes, all centered around a raucous central tavern room filled with dozens of tables. Currently under the ownership of a brash and cheerful lass called Luthania Wells, this hot spot for traveling traders and adventurers alike rarely sees an hour in the day (or night) where there isn't something interesting going on within.

##### 2. Azalea Street Park

Azalea Street, within "Abdar's Promenade", is one of "Emon's" oldest neighborhoods, and is full to bursting with small businesses, quaint homes, and hole-in-the-wall restaurants, such as the "Laughing Lamia". Amidst the chaos of daily life, Azalea Street is also home to a peaceful park overlooking the Ozmit Waterways. When the stress of constant battles becomes too much to bear, adventurers in the know take a moment to visit the Azalea Street Park and recover, maybe even swapping stories with other relaxing heroes. Legend has it that heroes who meditate among the flowers and drink in the sea air return invigorated by the spirit of the Wildmother. A statue of the Wildmother and Lawbearer dancing together graces a fountain in the center of the park. Once per week, a character can gain [inspiration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/inspiration.md) ([inspiration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/inspiration.md)) by taking a short rest in Azalea Street Park.

##### 3. Anvilgate

Made of stark black stone and adorned with intricate brass metalwork, this grand blacksmithy is one of the most striking buildings in "Abdar's Promenade". Decades ago, a restless craftsman from "Kraghammer" of the name Grahf Tiltkettle grew weary of solitary pursuits and worried that interest in blacksmithing would give way to the emerging trend of mass-production. Tiltkettle retired in "Emon" and dedicated his respectable fortune to ignite the spark of inspiration in those who wished to learn the ways of the hammer and anvil, hoping to instill the joy of the All-Hammer in a new generation. He funded the creation of Anvilgate, a massive, public blacksmithy where any folk who wished to try their hand at the smithing of metals could do so under the All-Hammer's guidance.

Cheaper ores and materials were often donated by friends of Tiltkettle to aid the volunteer mentors in teaching their craft to the less fortunate, while folks who wished to bring their own ingots were welcome to do so. The location has become popular enough to begin expanding its facility to include kilns for ceramics and looms for weaving. While the tools are open for anyone to use on the premises, all are warned of the curse that will beset any wanton thief who steals from under the All-Hammer's gaze.

##### 4. Traverse Junction

The most magically active structure in Tal'Dorei shines like a pyramid of pure sapphire in the bustling center of the "Erudite Quarter", its walls thrumming with arcane energy. It is the Traverse Junction, and all visitors to the "Erudite Quarter" stop to see it when they visit.

In nearly every major Exandrian city, there are [teleportation circles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) that link mages to other such [circles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) around the world. Each and every one of these major [circles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) has a twin in the Traverse Junction, a travel nexus for approved mages and world leaders. Any characters renowned in "Emon" or honored by the "Alabaster Lyceum" may make use of the Junction (for 50 gp, if they can't cast [teleportation circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md)), allowing them to travel to major cities such as "Westruun", "Syngorn", "Kraghammer", and "Whitestone" in Tal'Dorei; Port Damali and Rexxentrum in "Wildemount"; "Ank'Harel" in "Marquet"; and Vasselheim in "Issylra".

The telemagi who curate the [circles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) are always in search of new teleportation sigils to different lands; they are willing to pay a handsome sum for the services of powerful and magically skilled adventurers willing to seek out and catalog new circle sigils for their records.

##### 5. Alabaster Lyceum

The gleaming white halls and elaborate gardens of the "Alabaster Lyceum" signal to all who see them that they gaze upon the greatest institute of higher learning in Tal'Dorei—though numerous scholars in "Kraghammer" and "Syngorn" would heatedly dispute that claim. Regardless, this place is the heart of homegrown academia in the Republic of Tal'Dorei, boldly striving to make a name for itself alongside the ancient scholarly traditions of "Issylra", "Marquet", and "Wildemount". The "Lyceum" (for those who can afford the impressive tuition) is an unparalleled center for study and research of history, economics, alchemy, art, and—most of all—magic and the arcane. Many of Tal'Dorei's greatest scholars and bards paid their dues in these halls, and the history of the "Lyceum" and its graduates are featured in all manner of superstitions and folktales.

##### 6. Cloudwatch Palace

In the wake of the "Chroma Conclave's" destruction of "Emon", the towering palace that stood as home to the sovereign and the center of governance within the city fell to fire and ruin. In the decades since, construction began with the aid of the "League of Miracles" to construct a new palace to help house the "Tal'Dorei Council" and be a symbolic center for all major political affairs within the region. The Cloudwatch Palace now sits atop the once-smoldering hill where "Thordak" once claimed his roost, a symbol of "Emon's" enduring will and optimistic hope for the future. Within these high-arched halls, countless chambers hold space for diplomats, meetings, and in the case of holidays, grandiose celebrations that draw the attention of powerful figures all across Exandria.

##### 7. Thordak's Crater

One last unsettling element of the "Cloudtop District" is the elementally scarred remains of "Thordak's Crater". Even after two decades of healing from "the Ashari" of Pyrah, "Thordak's" fires still burn beneath the Cloudtop. The smoldering entrance to the caverns remains cordoned off from the public because of its unsightly appearance and sulfurous stench, and because fiery creatures occasionally try to claw their way out into the fresh air. The crater is often forgotten, but every few months an adventuring party makes their way inside to seek treasure or glory within the volatile caverns—and such expeditions are a favorite topic of conversation (and clandestine betting) among the politicians, political aides, remaining city nobility, and nouveau riche of "Emon".

Why "Thordak's" magic lingers enough to create these mindless [cinderslag elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cinderslag-elemental-tdcsr.md) is a mystery; but it seems to be limited to the crater, as the elementals cannot go beyond it without collapsing into inert slurry.

##### 8. Emon Skyport

This elevated port is complete with docking platforms solely for the use of skyfaring vessels. The original "Emon Skyport" was the first of its kind in Tal'Dorei, and its successor is every bit as revolutionary as the original.

The "Emon Skyport" was destroyed when the "Cinder King" claimed the "Cloudtop District" as his fiery throne, but like so much of "Emon", it has since been rebuilt. Unlike other parts of "Emon", this reconstruction was a joint venture between the "Arcana Pansophical" and the Alsfarin Union, a "Marquesian" guild responsible for the engineering and distribution of all [skyships](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) in Exandria.

Booking passage on a [skyship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) isn't cheap (see the "[Skyships](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/skyships-tdcsr.md)" sidebar), but the privilege is available to everyone that can pay. Generally, one passenger [skyship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) leaves "Emon" per week to each of the following locations:

- Vasselheim, "Issylra" (passenger ticket costs 2,500 gp)  
- "Whitestone", Tal'Dorei (passenger ticket costs 900 gp)  
- Port Damali, "Wildemount" (layover in "Whitestone"; passenger ticket costs 2,000 gp)  
- Ank'Harel, "Marquet" (passenger ticket costs 2,500 gp)  

Members of the "Tal'Dorei Council" can also usually pull strings to grant adventurers they hire free passage when on vital business.

##### 9. Tomb of the Last Sovereign

Uriel Tal'Dorei II, the Last Sovereign, was slain by the noxious breath of the green dragon Raishan during the attack of the "Chroma Conclave". Uriel's wife, Salda, survived him and petitioned the reformed "Council of Tal'Dorei" to build their last sovereign a tomb befitting his benevolence and magnanimity. They complied, and the monumental Tomb of the Last Sovereign is now home to not just Uriel's ashes, but to tribute from all who loved him. Those with wealth gave gold, while those whose hearts outweighed their purses gave more personal tribute.

Over twenty years ago, the Gravewatchers closed the tomb to all, supposedly to prevent vandalism, but have not reopened it after more than two decades. The Last Sovereign's eldest daughter, "Odessa Tal'Dorei", is furious. Despite her position of power on the "Tal'Dorei Council", she is unable to dispute the act because of the power the Gravewatchers have as keepers of the dead. It has come to the point where she seeks to secretly employ adventurers to uncover the Gravewatchers' true intentions—which involve the psychic influence of an aberrant creature of the "Crystalfen Caverns".

##### 10. Godsbrawl Ring

Though the Temple of the Stormlord always has a fighting ring in its center, the annual Godsbrawl transforms the earthen, torchlit sanctum into one of Tal'Dorei's most unusual tournament grounds. On the Day of Challenging, the god of athleticism's holy day, the brawny priests of the Stormlord invite warriors and worshipers of the entire pantheon to the Godsbrawl, asking that each temple offer forth their greatest warrior to act as their god's proxy in the tournament. The clergy of the Dawnfather and the Lawbearer send their champions, but rarely take it seriously, for they scorn the storm-priests' notion of "might makes right." Conversely, the champions of the Stormlord and the Platinum Dragon have a fierce—though friendly—rivalry, trading the title of Supreme Champion back and forth each year after a bloody (but rarely fatal) final round.

##### 11. The Black Bastille

Named for its ash-blackened walls, the ominous Black Bastille is a single-story prison within the "Military District" that holds Tal'Dorei's most dangerous and irredeemable criminals. The compound has no windows, no open courtyards, and only one entrance: two imposing steel doors, flanked by watchtowers. During the reign of the "Chroma Conclave", the prison was one of the first buildings attacked, setting hundreds of Tal'Dorei's worst criminals loose to sow chaos across "Emon". The Black Bastille has since been rebuilt, but dozens of its most deplorable inmates still run free, and the Arms of "Emon" are eager to recover them. Some include the human demon-summoner Felrinn Derevar, betrayer of the "Arcana Pansophical"; the half-elf pyromancer Illaman Falconsong, exile of the Fire Ashari; and the vampiric tiefling "Ixrattu Khar", cultist of The Whispered One and Tal'Dorei's foulest mass murderer.

##### 12. Walls of Tribute

Anyone who wishes to uphold justice and keep the peace can apply to join the Arms of "Emon". But before a recruit is given their armor and takes a vow to protect the city and its people, they must endure a grueling training regimen within the tall, featureless stone barricades of the Walls of Tribute, referred to wryly by recruits as the Quarry. There, they are trained in the physical aspects of peacekeeping, instructed on the habits of the city's criminal underbelly, and drilled in the laws and ideals of "Emon".

##### 13. House of Discipline

"Emon" does not have a standing army of its own. The skills imparted to the Arms of Emon are sufficient to maintain a rowdy populace, but they are carefully trained to use nonlethal force to restrain, rather than kill, all those whom they apprehend. Thus, when war comes to Tal'Dorei, the council appoints a Master of War and levies an army from the Arms of Emon, as well as the militias of its constituent settlements. They must report to the House of Discipline, where they are taught martial combat alongside the harsh realities of warfare. Those who endure their time in the House of Discipline are forged into an army ready to protect "Emon" and the rest of Tal'Dorei from the greater dangers of Exandria.

##### 14. Gilmore's Glorious Goods

The broad, single-story façade of Shaun Gilmore's wondrous magical emporium belies the extravagance of its interior. Within, the air is thick with a dozen competing perfumes, each more pungent than the last. The interior is impossibly large—certainly larger than its exterior walls would have you believe—and filled with seemingly endless rows of arcane curiosities and artifacts, many of whose cryptic functions have been lost to time. Everburning candles in an array of unnatural colors light the shop, casting tantalizing shadows over every bubbling phial and mystical orb. Those who enter the shop are first met by Gilmore's long-time assistant Sherri, a half-elf draped in deep purple robes. If they are lucky, or particularly convincing, they may even meet the hero Gilmore himself.

Even rarer a sight than Sherri or Gilmore is the latter's husband, a handsome elf named Darius. He is shy in public, a perfect counterbalance to Gilmore's bombast, but is said to have a singing voice and skill with the [lyre](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/lyre.md) that can make any mortal weep. Whether or not his husband is present, Gilmore is ever eager to recount his part in the fall of the "Chroma Conclave", often winkingly embellishing his role in the final battle with "Thordak" himself.

Gilmore's Glorious Goods sells all manner of magic items. Its stock varies, but typically includes magic items of very rare rarity and lower for the price range listed in the fifth edition core rules. Additionally, there are always unidentified items in Gilmore's vast back-room storage that he says he'll "get to eventually;" these may include one or two long-lost legendary items. Artifact-quality items are beyond even Shaun Gilmore's usual fare, but he might know clues to a specific artifact's location, whether through his own extensive knowledge or his rumored relationship with the "Tal'Dorei Council" as an expert consultant on matters of arcane objects. Magic items are expensive, and those strapped for cash may inquire about sponsorships and quests done in Gilmore's service.

![Glorious Gilmore himself s...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-gilmoresgloriousgoods.webp#center "Glorious Gilmore himself stands smiling outside of the door to his shop, motioning towards his sign.

Behind him stands his husband Darius, an elven man with blonde hair.")

#### Emon Adventures

Every district, point of interest, and scrap of current events described earlier in this section could be a plot seed you can turn into an adventure. In addition to those, you can use these adventure hooks to involve your players in an "Emonian" adventure.

##### Primordial Children (any level)

Rumors of terrible creatures of fire and teeth stalking the sewers spread throughout "Emon's" taverns. Such mutterings have gone largely ignored; however, an investigator has recovered what looks to be the broken remains of a large, leathery red egg, not far from a collapsed tunnel beneath the Cloudtop. It seems one of "Thordak's" primordial dragon spawn survived its father's demise and is lurking in the city's tunnels.

##### Council Business (any level)

The "Tal'Dorei Council"—particularly "Tofor Brotoras", Master of Defense, and "Allura Vysoren", Master of Arcana—frequently hire adventurers to undertake dangerous quests for the benefit of the realm. Once the characters do a deed great enough to catch the council's attention, they are contacted the next time they're in "Emon" to undertake a quest; choose from any of the other story hooks in this book or make a new one of your own. The council offers a reward equal to 1,000 gp × the average character level of the party.

##### Miraculous Escape (high-level)

Master of Arcana "Allura Vysoren" covertly contacts the characters with a worrisome claim. In the middle of the night, a former [Remnant cultist](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/remnant-cultist-tdcsr.md) named Hammond Kraith escaped the "Black Bastille", apparently with the aid of an invisible monster. She provides the party with the magic-inhibiting manacles he wore within the prison, in hopes that they can use them to follow his trail. What she doesn't know is that the "League of Miracles" broke Kraith out of prison using an invisible [master adranach](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/master-adranach-tdcsr.md). He is hiding out on an island in the "Lucidian Ocean", aided by a number of "Myriad" mercenaries and a captured [mage hunter golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/mage-hunter-golem-tdcsr.md) he has reprogrammed to serve him.

> Mythic tales of a pair of ancient hags swirl through learned circles within "Emon", typically to frighten "Lyceum" students off of wandering forbidden vaults at night. Some folk, however, take these whispers seriously. A number of explorers and treasure seekers wandering the subterranean ruins of "Crystalfen" have encountered one, or both, of these wretched witches, returning with tales of fright, dark dealings, and unholy pacts.

Their discovery and research of the profoundly magical location twisted their minds and bodies, infused them with power, extended their lives, and granted a glimmer of knowledge of some immense, unknowable purpose to the lost city. They've become obsessed with the mysteries of the ruins. The elder, Trysta, remains below to continue to excavate and study, while her sister Forscythia travels back and forth from "Emon" under the veil of a half-dozen illusions to acquire goods and gold in exchange for her unsettlingly insightful fortune-telling. Anyone who seeks the sisters with ill intent is rarely seen again, but those who stumble upon them often find themselves temporarily in service to them, a pact made out of fear and self-preservation.

### Crystalfen Caverns

Deep beneath the "Bladeshimmer Coast" is a sprawling network of natural caverns and rivers that predate the "Age of Arcanum". These tunnels reach even below the ocean, and have roots in early colonization by denizens of the Realms Beyond.

An ancient society of psychically powerful "aboleths" and other aberrations sprung up from a door between worlds and conquered this subterranean web, drove their slaves to construct "Salar", the Unseeable City, and slowly pressed upward toward the surface. Their plot was unintentionally ended when the final battle of the "Calamity" sent powerful waves of magical force throughout Exandria, causing much of the underground caverns to collapse and the aboleth civilization to fall under rock and rubble. Fragments of the City Which Eyes Cannot See still remain, however, with surviving terrors slowly rebuilding from the dust within their once-great capital.

The ruins of this sprawling city are now known as the Crystalfen Caverns. These caves are home to scattered veins of [azuremite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/azuremite-tdcsr.md), a gorgeous blue crystal that formed from millennia of psychic energies existing near element deposits. Curious explorers who discovered the veins found that, when mined and refined into a fine dust, the [azuremite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/azuremite-tdcsr.md) powder is a strong mind-altering agent and induces temporary visions and other psychic phenomena.

While a number of small, isolated entrances to this labyrinth of tunnels have been discovered and adventuring parties have attempted to chart the mines, the caverns are so vast and deep that either they gave up for fear of becoming lost, or they were assailed by the terrible denizens of the caverns, never to return. Most who now brave the caverns are foolish treasure hunters or criminals seeking to mine more [azuremite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/azuremite-tdcsr.md) to sell on the black market.

#### Crystalfen Caverns Adventures

##### Mining The Past (any level)

When the characters finish a short rest in the "Crystalfen Caverns", they must each make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a woman's voice fills their minds, saying, "I sense someone...are you truly here, too? Please...I am lost, and alone in the dark." The voice guides them down the twisting caves to a 120-foot-deep mine shaft. The stones at the bottom shimmer with faint azure light. Should they descend into the [azuremite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/azuremite-tdcsr.md) mine, they travel through an uncharted tunnel and find a lone, dying [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) with five levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that has wandered too far from its ruined domain.

The [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) doesn't seek to kill them—yet. Its only priority is self-preservation, and it needs help fending off the [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) that have made the mine their home in order to reach a subterranean lake where it can recover. Do the characters kill it or save it? If it reaches the lake, or dies, they are rewarded with a haunting premonition of the "Ruins of Salar", and a murky vision revealing the depths and expanse of the "Crystalfen Caverns".

![In the midst of a musky mi...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter3-crystalfencaverns.webp#center "In the midst of a musky miasma in a dark cavern sits a monstrous, reddish worm-like creature with two eyes stacked on top of each other. Tentacles expand from either side, it's toothy maw open. A green lizardfolk warrior sits, attentively listening.")

### Ruins of Salar

In the lightless nadir of the "Crystalfen Caverns", directly beneath the splendid "Port of Emon", rest the eternally slumbering ruins of Salar. No mortal has beheld these ruins—once the capital of a mighty [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) dominion—and returned to the surface with wits to tell the tale. Salar is known only in myth and legend as the Unseeable City, because mortal eyes cannot look upon its alien architecture without destroying their fragile minds. Salar is treated as an urban legend by "Emon's" scholars and archeologists. Nevertheless, many believe in its existence, for numerous scholars have returned from expeditions into the deep caverns with their minds shattered by otherworldly power.

Those who have returned from Salar brought back journals filled with increasingly crazed notes. The most intelligible of their writings indicate that all that survives of the ruined city are emerald marble structures of unfathomable design, seeming to shift and shimmer as the eye tries to comprehend, moving through time as they remain static in space.

The once-renowned archaeologist Karaline von Ethro claimed to have visions of Salar, describing a subterranean city with twisting pillars that stretched higher than any tower, kissing the seat of the surface world from the bedrock of the earth. At the peak of the central pillar floats a giant pearlescent disc. This so-called Moon Disc bathes the entire city in unsettling, milky light that refracts eerily through the emerald spires.

Karaline von Ethro is long since dead, and her journal—by far the most coherent record of the Unseeable City—is an apocryphal artifact. The "Arcana Pansophical" kept it in a closely guarded vault, which only added to its mystique. However, the journal was stolen long ago, and since then, dozens of manuscripts said to be the Von Ethro Journal have been sold in black markets across Tal'Dorei. Anyone lucky—or unlucky—enough to find the genuine journal would learn a terrible secret that the "Pansophical" has held onto in silence for decades: dozens, perhaps hundreds, of "aboleths" survive within Salar. Their master, Durrom of the Emerald Eyes, lives on in secrecy while expanding its army of thralls and learning all it can about the ignorant surface dwellers. Durrom's ultimate goal is to shatter the forgotten Pillars of the Earth beneath "Emon" and cause the city to collapse into its subterranean domain.

> [!note] Karaline von Ethro
> 
> Archeologist, anthropologist, and explorer extraordinaire; Karaline von Ethro was a human adventurer and inventor. It was her designs that created the Sunbeam Compass, a device that always directs the user to the sun by emitting a small light at the tip of the needle in a glass orb, allowing it to rotate in all directions—a very useful tool when exploring subterranean territory. However, despite her discoveries and inventions, she is most remembered for going mad after allegedly having visions of the Ruins of Salar. Karaline's madness eventually led to her tragic demise at the young age of 37.

##### Secrets Within Secrets (mid-level)

The characters are approached by Jomen Tash, an earnest half-elf mage of the "Arcana Pansophical", who claims to have obtained pages from the lost Von Ethro Journal. He shares his research with the characters and hires them to accompany him into the ruins, promising that he will guard their minds from any alien influence. But in truth, though Jomen was once a member of the "Pansophical", he has recently aligned his interests with the mysterious goals of the "League of Miracles". Is he leading the characters into danger with only counterfeit scrawlings to guide them, or does he actually hold part of Karaline von Ethro's description of "Salar" and its dangers?

### Scar of the Cinder King

It was thought that the lands surrounding "Emon" would never fully recover from "Thordak's" overwhelming elemental power. His presence not only incinerated his enemies—it wounded the land itself. After the "Cinder King's" defeat, the "Tal'Dorei Council" beseeched the Fire Ashari to travel from the distant lands of "Issylra" to "Emon" and lend their wisdom.

The frightful "Scar of the Cinder King" and "Thordak's Crater", both twisted by the red dragon's cancerous, fiery magic, were healed by the druids of the Fire Ashari over the course of about fifteen years—an act that the brightest minds of the "Arcana Pansophical" thought would take an epoch to achieve. Clouds of white ash still occasionally blow across the fields surrounding "Emon", but the last lingering reminders of the "Cinder King's" terror are beginning to vanish.

Nevertheless, the Fire Ashari left behind a group of four druids, led by a female half-orc named Lorkathar. They dwell in a small stone fortress known as Flamereach Outpost—a defensive fortification used when the scar was still spawning beings of flame and hatred. They vehemently warn all who enter to avoid using elemental magic of any sort—especially fire magic—as these evocations could cause the still tender division between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire to resonate and tear.

##### Reopening Wounds (any level)

"The Ashari" of Pyrah have claimed that the "Scar of the Cinder King" is healed—yet rumors have spread through "Emon's" "Erudite Quarter" that a representative of Pyrah has been seeking counsel with the "Arcana Pansophical" regarding the scar. While the characters travel through the once-scarred lands east of "Emon" to find their next adventure, they are shocked by a sudden earthquake, as the ground erupts with a serpentine, fiery crack. Magma and [cinderslag elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cinderslag-elemental-tdcsr.md) slowly seep from the crevasse, turning all they touch to ash.

### Ruins of O'Noa (New O'Noa)

- **Village.** Population: 310 (83% "humans", 17% "other races")  

The first human colonizers of Tal'Dorei journeyed across the Ozmit Sea, weathering terrible storms and deadly waves, and made landfall in "Daggerbay". From there, they founded the port city of O'Noa, and though the city quickly grew in wealth and influence, the early settlers were greeted with mistrust by the "elves" of "Syngorn". When King Warren "Drassig" took the throne of "Emon", no city suffered greater devastation than the contested region of O'Noa. It was the site of one of the "Scattered War's" bloodiest battles, and the arcane energies unleashed reduced the city to ruins and permanently scarred the land. Built within a cursed bay, and deprived of fertile land, it was agreed after the war that neither the new nation of Tal'Dorei nor "Syngorn" would attempt to rebuild the city, instead letting it stand as a reminder of the horrors of the "Scattered War".

Over centuries of dereliction, the ruins became a haven for outlaws and exiles, who named their refuge New O'Noa. They took this place of destitution and dust and made it into a refuge for all rejected by society. Though some of New O'Noa's people were exiled from their homes due to fear and prejudice—like people of ill fate born under the "full light of Ruidus"—most are thieves and delinquents. New O'Noa is ruled by a charismatic tiefling called Waken, who rose to prominence through honeyed words and selective murders.

New O'Noa still appears abandoned to the eyes of outsiders. Its inhabitants live and hide away from prying eyes, amidst ancient stone ruins and their catacombs. Those who venture too deeply into the ruins are rarely seen or heard from again—unless their loved ones can offer up a princely ransom.

##### This Too Solid Flesh (mid-level)

New "O'Noa" is a seedy town filled with strange magic. A [suude](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md) dealer named Shef Silverleaf is in major debt to Waken, the leader of the outlaw village. The characters enter the picture when Waken surreptitiously hires them to collect on his debt—perhaps under false pretenses to hide his illegal operation.

When the party tracks down Shef, they find more than they bargained for: his body has been turned to solid [silver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/silver.md). A [Remnant cultist](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/remnant-cultist-tdcsr.md) lurks in the shadows of New "O'Noa", and has been purchasing [suude](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md) from Shef for nearly three months. Shef uncovered his secret identity and confronted him—but the mage's magic, made chaotic by the [suude](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md), transformed Shef into solid [silver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/silver.md). Waken will take Shef's solid [silver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/silver.md) corpse as payment—but what if the silver-skinned man were still alive and able to magically walk away? And what of the cultist who transformed him?

### Seashale Mountains

A curious range of mountains runs along the "Bladeshimmer Shoreline" north of "Emon". The Seashale Mountains are named for their unique shape, akin to a tidal wave about to crash on the inland territories, frozen in dynamic stone.

Crashing waves and salty sea breezes have carved miles of twisted valleys between these jagged peaks, creating an unusual home for the creatures lurking within the cavernous rock, shoreside pools, and towering bluffs. High tide leads the briny waters into the Nightwash, a miles-long lagoon that wends its way through the base of the bluffs, carrying hosts of dangerous ocean life with each pass. Conversely, the tidal phenomenon also brings a valuable bevy of deep-sea fish on occasion, which gave birth to the fishing community of the Shalesteps. The mountains' strange peaks are decorated by copses of scraggly trees, stunted by the gravelly soil and stripped nearly bare by salty ocean breezes.

### The Shalesteps

- **Village.** Population 770 (40% "humans", 35% "halflings", 32% "dwarves", 3% "other races")  

The Shalesteps are a series of small, allied villages whose inhabitants chose to live a more simple life outside of the bustle of the capital city, but close enough to enjoy imports and protection should the need arise. Most of their food is sourced from the ocean and the Nightwash tide, while a small hunting community wanders the peaks for avian quarry and other sources of meat and natural resources. Those who live here are sturdy and ready to defend themselves against the dangerous wilds surrounding them—and against the occasional monstrosity that washes in with the tide.

The Shalestep village of Puddlefoot has never had anything remarkable happen to it. People there are quiet and simple, with no interest in tales of grand heroics. No great adventures have ever come to their rocky shore—until the whale. The dead whale, bloated with corruption, its white hide covered in oozing green lesions, is a source of fear for the nearby townsfolk. What happened to this behemoth? And why is Rill the Hermit ranting about seeing tall shadows spying on Puddlefoot from the mountain peaks?

### Visa Isle

Forty miles off the coast of the "Bladeshimmer Shoreline", west of the "Verdant Expanse", two islands belch clouds of black smoke into the open sky. "Visa Isle" and its smaller sister island have been surrounded by rumors and sailors' legends since the dawn of civilization. Some say that every night, the island burns to ash—giving it a distinctive orange glow—and that every day new trees grow to maturity by sundown. It is an island of fire and death.

Those who have explored its dense jungles and returned claim only to have found common wild pigs and—at worst—unusually large fire beetles and mantises. They were the lucky ones. They didn't wander unprepared into the Ruins of Vos'sykriss, and did not encounter the serpentine spirits that haunt its elder halls. The only expedition to have ventured into the Ruins of Vos'sykriss and lived to speak of it returned to "Emon" just as the "Chroma Conclave" descended upon the city. Their leader, a half-orc archaeologist and spiritspeaker named Jorlund Vohr, survived the destruction of "Emon", but all his notes and the artifacts he recovered were stolen. Decades later, the aging professor is still hard at work creating endless proposals for expeditions to "Visa Isle".

##### Awakening the Sleepers (mid-level)

In ancient times, Vos'sykriss was the seat of a serpentfolk empire that dominated southern Tal'Dorei. Before the "Calamity", their seers had visions of the coming destruction and desperately sought a way to survive it. The serpents constructed a magical stasis field beneath their city and chose their strongest and most powerful to slumber and rebuild the empire when the danger had passed.

They are now awoken. The [Vos'skyriss serpentfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/vosskyriss-serpentfolk-tdcsr.md) now prowl the island, being prepared by the lingering [Vos'skyriss serpentfolk ghosts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vosskyriss-serpentfolk-ghost-tdcsr.md) to claim the world for their own. When Jorlund Vohr's expedition delved into Vos'sykriss's deepest sanctum, they unwittingly ended the serpents' ancient spell and awakened the Sleepers. Soon, a people long thought extinct will return to claim the world as their own.

## Other Lands of Exandria

The land of "Gwessar", now known far and wide as the young nation of Tal'Dorei, is a sprawling, curious land full of adventure, danger, and glory. Though Tal'Dorei is a land rife with grand tales, the world of Exandria is far larger and more ancient than just the lands between the "Lucidian Coast" and the "Bladeshimmer Shoreline". Many of the people who live here either descend from or are immigrants to this realm.

Some of these other lands have been explored by Vox Machina and the Mighty Nein in *Critical Role*, but are beyond the scope of this book. You can populate these lands with dungeons, cities, characters, and stories of your own creation—or be inspired by the history of Exandria in "chapter 1" of this book, and the stories in the campaigns of *Critical Role*, to create a version of Exandria entirely your own.

### Issylra

Northwest of Tal'Dorei, across the freezing waters of the Ozmit Sea, lies Issylra, home to Vasselheim, commonly called the oldest surviving city on Exandria. Issylra is considered by most to be the land where all civilization emerged and spread in the time of the "Founding", making it the religious core for many, and the focal point of historical study for others. It was also where most of the flying cities of the "Age of Arcanum" first rose from the ground. Its people rose high—and fell hard from those dizzying heights, and to this day, many there still hate and fear the power of arcane magic.

The territory known as "Othanzia" encompasses a majority of the continent's developed regions, keeping most domains protected and governed by the might of the theocracy of Vasselheim. Nestled among eastern taiga forests of the Vesper Timberland, the city of Vasselheim stands as the oldest known seed of civilization and religion, and the only city to withstand every catastrophe that has rocked Exandria since the gods brought life to it. As the spiritual center of most of the world, Vasselheim is ruled by a coalition of high priests of the many "Prime Deities". These hierophants are viewed by their people as the defenders of their virtuous society, and of all of "Othanzian" culture.

Beyond Vasselheim's ancient walls are frigid, untamed wilds, some of which are untouched since the "Founding" itself. These lands are populated by ancient monsters and dire beasts. Smaller camps, communities, and townships are scattered across the surrounding snowy plains, and those who call "Othanzia" home have become hardy and self-sufficient.

Elsewhere in "Othanzia", the lands of Issylra are sparsely populated by scattered republics of varying morality. Traveling between these city-states is difficult, due to the lingering beasts of the "Calamity" that stalk the lands beyond Vasselheim.

### Marquet

Following the winds and waves to the southwest of Tal'Dorei across the Ozmit Sea eventually leads one to the chain of islands called the Hespet Archipelago and to the shores of the continent of "Marquet". The pebble beaches of the Bay of Gifts greet travelers with the charming sights of untouched nature, and the port city of Shamal invites all to engage in the pleasures of civilization, with beautiful ballrooms and gilded gambling halls.

Beyond the port of Shamal lies the rocky edge of the Aggrad Mountains, whose canyons and caverns house untold numbers of predatory creatures, before giving way to the immense Marquesian Desert. This sandy wasteland is rumored to have once been verdant jungle brought to ruin by the spear of the Ruiner in the "Calamity". Some stories tell of a great hero that sacrificed himself to save "Marquet" from utter annihilation, but only scattered fragments of this tale endure.

Near the center of this intense desert, surrounded by a sprawling network of small villages, is the grand city of "Ank'Harel", known as the Jewel of Hope. This city, built atop the Drowned City of Cael Morrow, is the center of culture, history, and power for all of "Marquet". Ruled by the mysteriously undying J'mon Sa Ord, "Ank'Harel" is a magnificent haven of music and culture. It's not without its dangers, but it is a paradise compared to the monster-infested sands that surround it.

The Hands of Ord, the city's guards, also protect nearby villages and townships within the desert, but they can only reach so far. Further south, beyond the reach of "Ank'Harel" and the Hands of Ord, the sands give way to scrubland and marshes tangled with the volatile mountains surrounding the smoking Suuthan Volcano and the dangerous clans that worship it. Westward, beyond the arid desert, lies a vibrant landscape of verdant jungles, craggy mountains, and magical mysteries that the people of "Marquet" have spent eons unraveling. Within the jungles of "Marquet" are dozens of cultures, some nomadic, some seafaring, and some with great cities of their own. One such city, founded by orcish survivors of the Ruiner's wrath during the "Calamity", is known across Exandria for its mathematically immaculate architecture. This realm welcomes scholars and travelers from across Exandria, who are eager to learn from the minds of some of the greatest architects the world has ever seen.

### The Shattered Teeth

Few sail into the dangerous waters southeast of Tal'Dorei, past the ever-present fog bank called the Fool's Curtain, and into the Shattered Teeth. This cluster of broken lands is made up of forty-three islands, varying in size from small, mile-wide reef-toppers to the large, city-holding isles like Ruukva. Two societies dwell within the Shattered Teeth. The first is the Ossended Host, a vast fishing culture that values their independence—even to the point of isolationism—and self-empowerment through the worship of the power of dreams and nightmares. The second is the Wanderman Assembly, a centuries-old trade company that, upon being stranded across the Shattered Teeth after losing their way in a typhoon, grew into a brutal, ruthless society dedicated to gaining profit at all costs. It masquerades poorly under the banner of honor and brotherhood.

This tension has led to bloodshed in recent years, and each group is paranoid that the other is bent on destroying their way of life. What brims beneath the surface of this conflict is the nature and source of the dreams the Ossended Host have been harnessing for generations, and what that answer may mean for the struggles of the people of the Shattered Teeth.

### Wildemount

Due east of Tal'Dorei, the lands of Wildemount are highly geologically varied, from the tropical Menagerie Coast, to the dour and rainy valleys of Western Wynandir, to the blasted wastes of Eastern Wynandir—better known as Xhorhas. The people of Tal'Dorei trade frequently with Wildemount, though the waters of the "Lucidian Ocean" are prowled by pirates, sea monsters, and forgotten aquatic demigods. Such a journey leads to the Clovis Concord, a federation of city-states that govern the Menagerie Coast, where a lively culture of trade, entertainment, and the arts flourishes amidst the illicit activities of local smugglers and the ever-present "Myriad" syndicate.

The Dwendalian Empire, an authoritarian power that seeks to expand its reach across all of Wildemount, reigns over the center of the continent. The empire is ruled by King Bertrand Dwendal, but tensions boil between the Crown and the Cerberus Assembly, the empire's league of arcanists and covert operatives. Though the assembly's power waxes and wanes, they are constantly maneuvering to become the true, shadowy power behind the Dwendalian Crown.

The empire's control over the resource-rich valleys in the center of Wildemount has helped make it a military superpower. Likewise, the natural defenses of the surrounding mountains make their lands easily defensible. For centuries, the idea that the empire is invincible has fueled recruitment propaganda for its military, the sanctimoniously titled Righteous Brand. King Dwendal's edicts have created a highly nationalistic society—one which permits only the worship of Crown-approved deities, submits to mandatory military service, and jingoistically endures immense taxes to support the Crown's wars.

Across the mountains east of the Dwendalian Empire are the wastes of Xhorhas, ruled by the Kryn Dynasty. This society was founded by dark "elves" who escaped the grasp of the Spider Queen through the grace of a supernatural being of light called the Luxon that granted them the ability to reincarnate into new bodies, life after life. Those who are reincarnated seek to broaden the knowledge of the Luxon by living bold lives and gaining new experiences. Today, the Kryn Dynasty is filled with not just dark "elves", but goblinkin, "orcs", ogres, kobolds, and all manner of other peoples considered to be "monsters" by the Dwendalian Empire.

Beyond the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, and the tensions that burn between them, are the lands of the Miskath Strand and the islands of Eiselcross. Both are realms twisted by forbidden magic, and inhabited by eldritch abominations and other creatures that are anthema to mortal life. Yet, despite the danger, the most courageous adventurers of Wildemount—and indeed, all of Exandria—see exploration as the pinnacle of heroism. At the fringes of the known world, where monsters from the edge of reality lurk...this is where true adventure begins.

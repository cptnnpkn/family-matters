# Chapter 2: Allegiances of Tal'Dorei
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, p. 27* 

![Two goddesses, the Wildmot...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter2-wildmotherandlawbearer.webp#center "Two goddesses, the Wildmother and the Lawbearer, stand large over a beautiful scene - a pastoral landscape on the left, a gleaming marble city on the right. The Wildmother is a black woman with long, vibrant red hair, a flower crown upon her head and a sleeveless white gown growing out of the nature around her. The Lawbearer is a white woman in dark blue robes and a breastplate of silver and gold. Their hands are lovingly intertwined.")

The lands of Tal'Dorei are governed not just by their history, but by factions and faiths striving to achieve myriad goals, fighting for conflicting ideals, and vying for the power to come out on top. The gods of Exandria may be barred from walking upon the land in material form, but they can still put their thumbs on the scales of history through their mortal followers. Such followers include clerics with the power to cast mighty spells, paladins who wield blades alight with idealistic verve, and untold thousands of common folk whose voices can affect the decisions of even the most powerful leaders of the land.

A number of factions hold just as much sway over the daily lives of the people as the gods and their clergy—perhaps even more. These factions range in might and influence from the greatest of the great to the smallest of the small. The "Tal'Dorei Council" institutes political policies that affect everyone in grand, sweeping, and often inscrutable ways, while the "Golden Grin" is a group of folk heroes who seek to subvert evil across the land. Whether these factions are governments or just tiny organizations, they can add depth and conflict to your Tal'Dorei campaign.

## Pantheon of Exandria

During the "Divergence", the "Prime Deities" created a powerful barrier between the Material Plane and the supernatural realms of the Outer Planes. This gate sealed all gods, including the evil "Betrayer Gods", within their respective domains. If the Divine Gate were to be destroyed by the unanimous effort of the "Prime Deities", all powers would be unleashed, threatening armageddon. Thus, the gods patiently watch their creations from beyond the veil, aiding their faithful with what small power they can send through the barrier.

Some lesser idols, such as archdevils, demon lords, fiends and celestials of near-divine power, as well as a number of unaccounted-for demigods reside among the planes. They are affected by the Divine Gate, preventing them from crossing it of their own volition, yet are not so bound by it that they cannot be summoned by mortal magic.

The following gods are recommended as the existing Exandrian pantheon, but they are only a recommendation. As long as the GM and the players agree, you are welcome to tailor, alter, or completely change the gods in your Tal'Dorei campaign to fit your needs. The domains listed are the likely choices for followers of that deity, but these are not the only options.

### Divine Domains

Most clerics can gain their magic from a single god, or even from a number of gods that share domains or divine provinces. Ultimately, how your cleric serves the gods or their core religious philosophies is for you and your Game Master to discuss. Each god in this chapter has two or three Divine Domains from which many of their clerics are granted power.

Nevertheless, almost all deities can have clerics who gain the power of any domain, if you and your Game Master agree.

### Prime Deities

The Prime Deities are the leaders and luminary creators that battled the Primordial Titans and instigated the "Founding", forging the mortal races of Exandria. They hold sway over powers that represent a spectrum of sunlight, truth, moonlight, benevolent concealment, protection, love, death, and all other facets of freedom and life in the world. While these gods may disagree and squabble, they are united in an alliance dedicated to ensuring the survival of their creations.

![Prime Deities](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/prime-deities-tdcsr.md)

### Betrayer Gods

The "Betrayer Gods" are the deities who strayed from the ideals of the "Founding" and embraced the destructive chaos of the Primordials. The "Betrayer Gods" rarely work together, for they see one another as threats to their own goals. This very weakness allowed the "Prime Deities" to defeat and banish them, ending the "Calamity".

![Betrayer Gods](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/betrayer-gods-tdcsr.md)

#### Betrayer Curses

The malign powers of some "Betrayer Gods" linger in Exandria, both as myth and reality.

> [!note]
> This book adds the following curses:

[Curse of Strife](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/curse-of-strife-tdcsr.md)

> [!embed-reward]- Curse of Ruin
> ![Curse of Ruin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/curse-of-ruin-tdcsr.md)

### Lesser Idols

Though the gods still make their wills known upon the world by granting power to mortal clerics and by delivering edicts through their celestial or fiendish servitors, the Divine Gate inhibits them from exercising their full powers over the fate of Exandria. The same is not true for the lesser idols, beings of demi-godly power that have, in the absence of true gods, used their splendid and profane forms to amass their own cult followings.

Dozens of these powers are worshiped in relative secret across Exandria. Some are supernatural beings like archfey or archfiends that have taken up near-permanent residence on the Material Plane. Others are unknown fragments of the power of primordial Creation, given form. Most are mortal champions that have gained near-divine power through magic, the blessings of the gods, or through mythic effort and training. In all of these cases, the worship of mortals elevates these beings to something greater than they were before, imbuing them with fragments of divine power—and allowing them to grant scraps of that power back to the mortals in whom they take an interest.

![Lesser Idols](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/lesser-idols-tdcsr.md)

> [!note] Other Secluded Champions
> 
> A handful of other mortals exist in Tal'Dorei who have risen to nearly divine power through destiny or sheer will. Much like Azgrah, the vast majority of these champions live out their lives in seclusion—and perhaps it is their seclusion that grants them the ability to lend their powers to others, while they await the day that their full strength is at last needed to defend their people.

> All have their own stories, but no matter their tales, whether they are honored or despised by their kinsfolk, they are all mythic iconoclasts. Other secluded champions of Tal'Dorei that you may wish to develop into idols of your own include:

## Factions and Societies

While the dominant cultures of the continent have molded structure and law from the rough clay left beyond the "Divergence", these very cultures are comprised of a number of smaller factions that together create the whole. Whether they be a union of opportunists, ever-vigilant to reap the benefits of an exploitable populace, or bands of like-minded politicians, striving to maintain control in a land beset by chaos and danger, each faction seeks to drive and manipulate the social and political direction of Tal'Dorei. The alliances and tensions that can arise between the following societies can guide your adventurers' destiny across the spectrum of heroism and villainy.

![A castle is in the midst o...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter2-rebuildingemon.webp#center "A castle is in the midst of reconstruction by a spellwright and her adranach - a purple, manticore-like purple beast of pure magical energy. The adranach flies upwards, carrying a large stone brick in its talons. In the background, directing from the ground is the spellwright, their magic staff held aloft to control the adranach.")

### Tal'Dorei Council

When the new reign of Tal'Dorei was established three centuries ago, "Zan Tal'Dorei" deposed a brutal tyrant. Though she was beloved by the people, she did not wish to be given unchecked or un-counseled rule over the realm. Nevertheless, her inner circle obeyed the will of the people and crowned her Sovereign of Tal'Dorei. She took to her new role well and swiftly expanded her council by appointing some of her trusted allies—and even some dissenting voices—to form an assembly of scholars, generals, and philosophers to govern at her side. This "Council of Tal'Dorei" worked alongside their sovereign to rebuild the realm following the end of "Drassig's" line, and were instrumental in the following prosperity of the nascent Tal'Dorei Empire.

Twenty-six years ago, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, the latest and last of the Tal'Dorei line, publicly ended the monarchy and passed power over to the council, formally divesting his line of power. Tragically, this ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of the four ancient dragons known as the "Chroma Conclave". The dragons destroyed the city of "Emon", and the man who had until moments ago been sovereign was one of the first casualties. Uriel Tal'Dorei is survived by his wife Salda, and three children—"Odessa", Illiya, and Gren—who have used their family's still considerable wealth and power to become well-known public figures in "Emon". "Odessa" herself won a seat on the council in a landslide victory.

In the generation since the fall of "Emon", the council has risen to the challenge of rebuilding and governing their new republic. This state's power is highly decentralized; each individual city-state in Tal'Dorei largely acts according to its own interests, with the council in place to ensure that pursuing those interests benefits the common good. Some critics of the republic say that the "Tal'Dorei Council" is little more than a glorified city council for "Emon", though it is just as often praised for governing lightly as a rule, and for using the spy network helmed by the council's Master of Law to root out corruption as needed.

In addition to the historical Six Masters whose positions have existed on the "Tal'Dorei Council" since Zan's time, a variable number of delegates also cast votes in matters of state. Each settlement in Tal'Dorei whose population numbers at least five thousand is offered the option to elect delegates to the council if they wish to engage in national politics. The settlement is permitted one delegate per five thousand people, and the means of their election is left to the settlement's local government. Additionally, any settlement with a population of over twenty thousand can appoint an ambassador to "Emon"; these ambassadors also sit on the council and have voting power. Once in "Emon", each township's delegation is expected to negotiate with one another and find agreement. If an accord can't be reached, they must go through the slow process of drafting proposals to be voted on by seated members of the council.

Though "Kraghammer" and "Syngorn" remain sovereign city-states, the invasion of the "Chroma Conclave" convinced lawmakers that even tighter alliances between the peoples of Tal'Dorei were necessary. One ambassador each from both "Kraghammer" and "Syngorn" now also holds a seat with voting power on the council. Each city-state has likewise sent a delegation to "Emon" to vouch for their interests.

![The symbol of the Tal'Dore...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-taldoreicouncil.webp#center "The symbol of the Tal'Dorei Council which is outlined, first in gold, then sapphire blue. Inside is a field of emerald green with a golden phoenix atop a silver center. The phoenix hovers over ruby red and yellow flames. Eight five-pointed silver stars surround the phoenix.")

#### Goals

Following "Zan Tal'Dorei's" coronation, the "Tal'Dorei Council" existed to aid and inform the sovereign on how best to execute their duties. The council has evolved to manage the affairs of the city of "Emon" and provide a private forum for delegates from across the land to shape the future of Tal'Dorei. The council is made up of six masters, whose roles have existed since the time of "Zan Tal'Dorei", and a variable number of ambassadors from all city-states across the continent who wish to participate in the coalition of power that is the Republic of Tal'Dorei.

The Six Masters are elected by a popular vote of all city-states who have sent an ambassador to the council. These masters are each beholden to a domain of responsibility, and they either inherit the existing infrastructure of civil servants, or restructure with the approval of the rest of the council. The domains are divided as such: Development, Arcana, Law, Commerce, Information, and Defense. Additionally, the first business of the council upon delivering or receiving a declaration of war is to elect a Seventh Master: the Master of War, who is appointed to the council by a vote of all sitting masters, ambassadors, and delegates. The council members are responsible for these domains throughout the city of "Emon" and work closely with community leaders in other cities to maintain order.

**The Master of Development** works with the masonry and carpentry guilds to oversee all major infrastructure projects within "Emon", as well as allocating resources to projects needed in settlements that have a delegation in the council. In the past two decades, the current Master of Development has added an unprecedented eight Lieutenant Masters of Development to his staff to serve the reconstruction needs of each city in the republic.

**The Master of Arcana** keeps vigil over the lawful use of magics within Tal'Dorei, informs the council on matters beyond the mundane, and occasionally works with the "Alabaster Lyceum's" Headmaster. This council member is currently embroiled in debates over the danger that the "League of Miracles" poses to organizations like the "Arcana Pansophical".

**The Master of Commerce** works with all major merchant guilds and trading networks within "Emon" and beyond. They are to maintain healthy trade at home and abroad, especially between squabbling delegates, and establish the government's annual budget.

**The Master of Information** manages foreign diplomacy, and also serves as the head of a network of spies that, these days, is supplemented by the skilled eyes of the "Clasp". Their work as spymaster and chief diplomat seeks to root out threats to the republic from within and without.

**The Master of Defense** is head of the "Emon" Guard, High Commander of "Fort Daxio", and manages the allocation of federal resources to city guard groups throughout Tal'Dorei. They work closely with the Master of Law to mobilize armed troops throughout the country if supernatural or nonmilitary threats arise during peacetime.

**The Master of War** is a temporary position only instated during times of open or impending warfare. As Tal'Dorei has only a small standing army, this newly appointed master then assembles a military from city guards and town militias across the nation, mobilizing the elite warriors of "Fort Daxio" as needed. When peace is declared, the position is dissolved until it is called for again.

#### Relationships

The council maintains free travel, free trade, and free communication between its constituent settlements, and between the republic and its allies—both on Tal'Dorei and abroad. The incursion of the "Chroma Conclave" has united the oft-feuding city-states of "Syngorn" and "Kraghammer" like never before, and all of Tal'Dorei now enjoys free trade and open borders between even its most remote enclaves. Thanks to the actions of Vox Machina, the previously solitary city-state of "Whitestone" has joined the republic, to the benefit of both.

The "Clasp" was once considered a serious threat to the council's rule, but times have changed. These days, "Clasp" Spirelings in "Emon" frequently make public appearances before the council on behalf of their own organization and their often unscrupulous business partners. This is to say nothing of the "Clasp's" deep involvement in the Master of Information's spy ring.

The "Tal'Dorei Council" has comfortable trade and diplomatic agreements between the realm of "Othanzia" in "Issylra" and the loosely federated cities of the Clovis Concord in "Wildemount". The recent conclusion of a bloody war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty in "Wildemount" has given the "Tal'Dorei Council" cause to send ambassadors to both nations to establish embassies, in hopes of creating an historic arrangement with all of the sovereign nations of that oft-maligned continent. On the continent of "Marquet" to the southwest, the great city of "Ank'Harel" has been friendly and open when it comes to trade and commerce, but has shown no interest in any political relationships beyond that.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Tal'Dorei Council" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### Guardian Tofor Brotoras

*"Dragonblood" Master of Defense*

Stern, honorable, and quick to anger, Tofor is proud to serve on the council. After losing many friends (and one of her own arms) in the struggles against the "Chroma Conclave", she took the vulnerability of the city to heart, swearing never to allow such a thing to happen again. She is a beloved hero of the war against the "Chroma Conclave" and has served on the council since before the death of the Last Sovereign. Most folk in "Emon" suspect she'll win reelection until the day she dies.

##### Seeker Odessa Tal'Dorei

*Human Master of Information*

When the eldest daughter of the Last Sovereign campaigned for the Master of Information's seat, its current holder was Seeker Assum Emring, a loyal servant of her father's. He bowed out of the race, and his blithe quote made headlines in "Emon": "I taught her everything she knows." She won in a landslide. Odessa wields the dual blades of Assum's spy network and the mercenary agents of the "Clasp" with practiced finesse. Nevertheless, her name and the legacy of her father's martyrdom weigh heavily upon her. As Seeker, Odessa is calm, methodical, and laconic, but she carries a dignified sorrow.

##### Arcanist Allura Vysoren

*Human Master of Arcana*

"Allura Vysoren" has held the position of Master of Arcana since before the "Chroma Conclave's" attack, and is held in the esteem of Tal'Dorei's people—mages and common folk alike. As a member of the "Arcana Pansophical", she is also increasingly worried as more and more of Tal'Dorei's politicians fall in debt to the "League of Miracles". After decades of investigating supernatural abnormalities herself, age has finally forced her to limit her adventuresome excursions. She now is one of the council's foremost employers of adventurers.

![Allura Vysoren is an older...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter2-alluravysoren.webp#center "Allura Vysoren is an older white woman with long, greying hair worn in a braid, a golden circlet upon her head. She is draped in indigo robes with golden flower embroidery on the hem. In one hand she holds a long scroll. The other hand manipulates a purple mage hand, which holds a book as an enchanted quill writes within it.")

##### Arbiter Brom Goldhand

*Human Master of Law*

A stone-faced, gray-haired, flame-scarred cleric of the Knowing Mentor, Brom is as mysterious as he is proficient with law. One thing is clear: he is dedicated to keeping the realm just and orderly, and there are few who would dare challenge his judgement.

##### Hearthmaker Edelbern Cleareyes

*Goliath Master of Development*

As a goliath of the "Rivermaw nomads", no one expected Edelbern to have an interest in civic architecture. Yet, after growing up in "Westruun" while it was occupied by the Herd of Storms some twenty years ago, he found that he preferred the beauty of stone towers to towering pines. He also possessed a remarkable gift of mathematical acuity, and used his skills to set "Westruun"—and eventually all of Tal'Dorei—on the path of reconstruction. Edelbern is also idealistic to a fault, and has, in his dedication to restoration, been manipulated into handing numerous lucrative contracts to the "League of Miracles", allowing them to amass greater and greater power.

##### Coinmistress Vex'ahlia de Rolo

*Half-elf Master of Commerce*

As a member of Vox Machina and hero of the realm, [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) could help Tal'Dorei in any number of ways. She already held a ceremonial title in "Whitestone" as "Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt". Yet when she and her husband pushed for "Whitestone" to be formally recognized as a constituent city of the Republic of Tal'Dorei, all who knew her name (and her legendary financial savvy) clamored for her to be elected to the council as Coinmistress. She took to the duty with aplomb, and fights hard to ensure that "Emon" never gets the bad end of a deal when gold is involved.

##### Ambassador Syldor Vessa

*Elf ambassador from "Syngorn"*

[Vex'ahlia's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) elven father has served as his city's ambassador to "Emon" for well over a century, and requested to be appointed a seated ambassador as soon as the office was created. Though he is otherwise a staunch traditionalist, Syldor was inspired by his brave children to move past his old racial prejudices and drive his homeland to be less bigoted and xenophobic—learning from his own mistakes as a father to two half-elven children. His relationship with his elder daughter is still strained, and it is a newsworthy occasion when they vote in accord.

##### Ambassador Deirdrik Greyspine

*Dwarf ambassador from "Kraghammer"*

The youngest son of the ruling House Greyspine of "Kraghammer", Deirdrik has little hope of being elected Ironkeeper. Instead, this ambitious young dwarf—a scant seventy years old—left his home to win political renown in the national arena. He is a romantic idealist at heart and always votes for bold new policies, but doesn't always think through the consequences of his actions.

##### Ambassador Keyleth of the Ashari

*Half-elf ambassador from "Zephrah"*

A legendary archdruid and member of Vox Machina, [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) is both leader of the Air Ashari and ambassador for all Tal'Dorei's "Ashari" peoples. She despises politics, and is focused entirely on improving the wellbeing of as many people as possible—as well as involving "the Ashari" on the national stage. She spends most of her time in "Zephrah", with her people—including her father, Korrin, and her newly returned mother, Vilya—but she can and will arrive in "Emon" at the drop of a hat, if [Vex](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) asks it of her.

##### Delegate Kel'jaia Uloeh

*Gnome delegate from "Syngorn"*

Kel'jaia is a confident gnome with incredible strength and resilience—both physical and emotional. She is thought by all to be the council's first choice for Master of War, should the time ever call for it. She was born in the "Rifenmist Jungle" and grew up amidst mercenaries who fought against the "Iron Authority". After her commander was killed in battle, she traveled north to "Syngorn" to seek aid in her fight. She dreams of forging bonds of unity between her homeland and Tal'Dorei.

### Arcana Pansophical

All of Tal'Dorei's greatest mages fought at the "Battle of the Umbra Hills". They saw the incursion of demons and devils firsthand, and were rightly terrified that the spawn of the "Betrayer Gods" could ever return to the world. It was clear that the "Divergence" had not wholly prevented supernatural evil from infringing upon the world, and that the mages of Exandria must prevent future "surprises" of this nature. The mistakes of the "Age of Arcanum" must never be repeated. In light of this, "Yurek Windkeeper", high enchanter of "Syngorn" and a well-respected arcanist, reached out to the realm's most trusted and capable mages, and together they formed a private society called the "Arcana Pansophical".

![A golden rhombus with a bl...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-arcanapansophical.webp#center "A golden rhombus with a blue eye in its centre atop an oblong blue and purple magical holy symbol.")

#### Goals

The chief priority of this fellowship of powerful arcane specialists is to maintain the Truth of Magic, a strict code enacted to never again allow the rampant misuse of magic seen in the "Age of Arcanum". General members are referred to as Guides, while the higher circle of members who deal in judgment and oversight are called Makers. At least one member is established at each place of arcane learning.

Membership is largely kept secret unless out of necessity, though the existence of the order is relatively common knowledge. Anyone found to be practicing magic is logged and routinely checked up on, as misuse of magic is grounds for arrest, judgment by the Makers, and punishment outside of the local law. Even so, the reach and sight of the "Arcana Pansophical" are not without limits, and many dark and terrible dealings manage to escape their notice.

> [!note] The Truth of Magic
> 
> The "Pansophical's" myriad rules on the use and misuse of magic are innumerable—detailed at length in centuries of amendments made to the full text of the Truth of Magic. Though the Truth's bizarre intricacies are left up to the GM, the Truth's preamble establishes three unbreakable edicts:
> 
> > [!quote]-  
> > 
> > In the Eternal interest of the Preservation of Harmony within the realm of Exandria, we the Arcana Pansophical establish the Truth of Magic, and three Edicts from which none shall stray. Those Arcanists found in gross violation of the Truth will be punished by the full extent of this Order—outside of any local law.
> > 
> > Though the school of Necromancy shall be restricted to none, in the interest of magical study and Understanding, the animation of the dead is a Violation of the Truth.
> > 
> > The Arcane is a tool to be wielded for the good of the People. To use its Power in the pursuit of wanton Destruction or unjust Murder is a Violation of the Truth.
> > 
> > In addition, though the Jurisdiction of the Pansophical supersedes the power of local laws, a mage who willfully breaks the laws of the land is in Violation of the Truth.

#### Relationships

The "Arcana Pansophical" is respected, if somewhat feared, throughout the Republic of Tal'Dorei. "Syngorn" and other elf-founded settlements see the "Pansophical" as allies, as the roots of the society began within "Syngorn" itself. The people of "Kraghammer" are suspicious of the "Pansophical's" legalistic Truth of Magic, and they fear that its members hold more loyalty to the "Pansophical" than to their homeland.

Recently, a group of profit-driven arcanists splintered from the "Arcana Pansophical" to form the self-styled "League of Miracles". Their involvement in the for-profit reconstruction of Tal'Dorei has made them popular among mages who see the "Pansophical" as a stodgy, elitist institution. The "Pansophical", however, sees the "League of Miracles" as a distasteful upstart that will soon buckle under its own ambition.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Arcana Pansophical" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up your own NPCs.

##### Enchanter Yurek Windkeeper

*Elf wizard (enchanter) and Maker*

Founder of the "Arcana Pansophical", the ancient archmage Yurek generally stays within "Syngorn", acting as the nexus of the order and a consultant to the "Wardens of Syngorn".

##### Alchemist Oz Gruude

*Halfling alchemist and Maker*

Gruude is an ornery old halfling who is more interested in traveling the world to study plants and minerals with latent magical properties than doing alchemical lab work. He is rarely seen in the halls of the "Pansophical".

##### Seer Gloria Ios

*Human wizard (diviner) and Maker*

Gloria is one of the great diviners of the age, and her duties have sent her to Vasselheim, where she acts as a foreign outreach for the "Pansophical".

##### Magus Seanor Wiles

*Human wizard (enchanter), Maker, and tutor*

A humble-looking traveler, Wiles delights in finding fresh and emerging talent and helping his new students refine their arcane gifts.

##### Planerider Ryn

*Tiefling wizard (conjurer), Maker, and planar studies specialist*

This former pupil of "Yurek Windkeeper" has grown into a master of planar travel. She likewise has taken an interest in the flow of magic across the world by means of ley lines. She's constantly on the move, traveling from plane to plane to conduct her research.

##### Tinkerer Quash Dentdruggle

*Gnome construct specialist and Guide*

Obsessed with the development of autonomous and living arcane constructs, Quash is usually holed up in his laboratory within "Kraghammer".

##### Arcanist Allura Vysoren

*Human wizard (abjurer) and Guide*

As a member of the "Tal'Dorei Council" and a retired adventurer, "Allura" has helped maintain the political significance of the "Arcana Pansophical" within "Emon". Even among her colleagues in the "Pansophical", her unpretentious strength commands great respect.

##### Elementalist Drake Thunderbrand

*Dwarf wizard (evoker) and Guide*

Driven to bind the physical elements of the chaotic planes to his will, Drake is a prodigy of new incantations in the field. He and "Allura Vysoren" are lifelong friends, and together they're renowned for achieving the impossible.

##### Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien

*Human archmage and Maker emeritus*

Though he was a Maker for most of his life, Realmseer Ryndarien grew frustrated with the politics and limitations of the "Pansophical", eventually retiring to "Westruun" to pursue his own interests. These days, he has found a way to rejuvenate his aged body and is now renowned as a handsome and aloof man about town—much to the annoyance of all who formerly knew him.

### The Ashari

The Material Plane is surrounded on all sides by the churning chaos of the elements. This elemental power is invisible to most, but in some places, the veil between this world and the Elemental Planes grows thin—and sometimes is torn entirely asunder. These places where the Elemental Planes bleed into the world are called rifts, and they first appeared on a long-ago Celestial Solstice when the planes aligned. That day, elemental rifts of untold proportions burst open across Exandria. Wildfires, tsunamis, hurricanes, and earthquakes ravaged the lands, and the people of the world struggled to combat the elemental beings that poured forth from the rifts. The tide of rampaging elementals was eventually stemmed, but the world was gripped by fear—what would happen on the next solstice?

In the wake of the planar disturbance, a society of druids called the Ashari made a covenant to divide and form four separate orders to seal and watch over the sources of these unleashed energies. Most of the lesser rifts that opened in that time have been healed, but one rift to each of the four Elemental Planes remains in Exandria. The four orders of the Ashari settled near these rifts, watching over them and soothing them when they grow volatile. Of these orders, two are in Tal'Dorei, where they watch over the rift of earth and the rift of air. A dozen generations later, the Ashari still hold watch over these tumultuous locations.

#### Ashari Culture

Though the Ashari began as a single group of elementalists, their individual orders have each developed their own ways of living over the centuries.

The people of Pyrah value reactivity and coolness under pressure, for panic is death during an eruption. The Ashari of Vesrah have a close relationship with the marine life that surrounds their rift, and their actions always prioritize the health of Exandria's waters. "Zephrah's" culture values the freedom of the open sky, and balances their sense of duty with a free-spirited sense of play. Finally, the society of "Terrah" is rooted in planning for the future, and fixing what is broken with patience and humility.

![A holy symbol of four inte...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-ashari.webp#center "A holy symbol of four intersecting triangles stacked on each other to form an hourglass shape. The top triangles are both upside-down, with the top most green and the second light-blue. The bottommost triangle is dark blue, with a red one on top of that.")

#### Goals

Each Ashari order guards their respective rift between one of the elemental planes and Exandria. Here, they strive to understand, master, and ultimately subdue the ever-escaping elemental forces. They attempt to bring balance to the surrounding lands and heal the rift over time, though recurring cosmic events tend to reopen these wounds.

"The Ashari" of Pyrah oversee the Fire Elemental Rift in the valley caldera of the Sunderpeak Mountain range in "Othanzia", upon the continent of "Issylra". "The Ashari" of Vesrah watch over the Water Elemental Rift on the Islands of Anamn, within the Ozmit Sea. On the southwest edge of the "Cliffkeep Mountains", "the Ashari" of "Terrah" stand vigilant over the Earth Elemental Rift, while high atop the windy mountaintops of the "Summit Peaks", "the Ashari" of "Zephrah" keep the Air Elemental Rift. The Air Ashari also watch over the "Frostweald", where a being of elemental ice once broke through to cause untold destruction.

Due to their isolation, "the Ashari" go to great lengths to maintain contact with their kin. Each order is led by a single elemental master, a title that is passed on by blood or honor for generations. In every new generation that comes of age, the young leader-to-be must embark upon an Aramente. This "noble odyssey" sends them across the world to meet with the other Ashari leaders and train until they have earned both the respect and an understanding of their hosts.

Upon returning, they ascend to the head of their order, while the elder retires. This journey often takes years, and should one such Ashari not return within a reasonable period of time, a next-of-kin or a suitable elemental adept is chosen to take up the Aramente.

#### Relationships

"The Ashari" maintain peaceful, if sometimes strained, relationships between the orders, though inner conflict occasionally arises within them. Beyond this, much of life within "the Ashari" is hidden from outsiders' prying eyes. In recent years, however, [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) of the "Zephrah" has taken steps to unite "the Ashari" with the rest of the people of Tal'Dorei. She has gone so far as to become an ambassador for "the Ashari" people on the "Tal'Dorei Council". Part of this work has been expanding the crisis orbs system, which "the Ashari" used to contact their distant kin in times of peril, to connect cities across Tal'Dorei in the event of another crisis on the level of the "Chroma Conclave".

"The Ashari" of "Terrah" nurture a seed of disrespect and mistrust for "Kraghammer", whose miners constantly disregard their warnings against reckless mining. This arrogance caused countless deaths in the most recent eruption of the "Terrah" Rift—and led to the collapse of an entire mountain.

Each Ashari culture has its own favored deities. Many Ashari of Pyrah venerate the Dawnfather, for his flames give life to Exandria. Many in Vesrah worship the Moonweaver, for her work controls the tides. In "Zephrah", the faith of the Wildmother is predominant, for her freedom is like that of the wind. And the people of "Terrah" hold the All-Hammer in great respect for his association with creation and the earth. There are many Ashari, as well, who prefer to revere the elements themselves, forgoing the worship of gods.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of "the Ashari" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### Pa'tice, Heart of the Mountain

*Human leader of "Terrah"*

Elderly leader of the Earth Ashari, Pa'tice still shows vigor and strength to resist his age, having led his people through many very tough challenges. His stubbornness is legendary, and it's said even death has been forced to wait until Pa'tice sees it his proper time. Many believe that his druidic training will keep him alive until he himself chooses to let go of this mortal coil.

##### Korrin of Zephrah

*Half-elf elder of "Zephrah"*

His wife Vilya was lost while she undertook the Aramente, and when the previous Voice of the Tempest died of illness, Korrin was called upon to act as Voice until his daughter [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) came of age and completed her Aramente. Korrin was shocked when Vilya suddenly returned, and now spends his days in disbelieving bliss, reunited with his long-lost wife. He is gentle with those who show honor, and merciless to those who threaten his people.

##### Vilya, Who Escaped Death

*Half-elf elder of "Zephrah"*

Vilya disappeared on her Aramente nearly thirty years ago, and was presumed dead. Her daughter, [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md), took up her own Aramente ten years after Vilya left, and discovered from the Water Ashari of Vesrah that Vilya was killed by a [kraken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md), and only her leg was able to be recovered. Less than a year ago, Vilya suddenly strode out of a tree in "Zephrah", her leg replaced with a druidic prosthetic of her own creation, shocking all—though none were more overwhelmed with emotion than her daughter and husband. Though Vilya never earned the title of Voice of the Tempest, she now aids her daughter in leading her people without the faintest trace of jealousy.

##### Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest

*Half-elf leader of "Zephrah"*

Hero of Tal'Dorei and member of Vox Machina, [Keyleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md) completed her Aramente and took leadership among her people following the destruction of the "Chroma Conclave". She seems to have not aged a day since Vox Machina's victory over The Whispered One. Since her beloved's death, she has kept busy to fill the void in her heart. From expanding the crisis orb network across the realm and building beautiful windmills in the "Summit Peaks" with [Percy's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) aid to training Air Ashari heroes at home, she has never allowed herself a free moment. She has rarely left "Zephrah" in the months since her mother's emotional return.

### Brawler's League

The brutal blood sports of the Brawler's League began, unsurprisingly, during the vicious "Drassig" Dynasty. In that cruel era, many of "Emon's" affluent and indolent social elite used their wealth to engage in entertainment of a more "visceral" variety. The kingdom's poor were already fighting each other for scraps; why not pay them to literally fight to the death for their amusement?

Some strong, charismatic ruffians used this opportunity to gain social power for themselves, and chief among them was a rough-and-tumble entrepreneur from "Kraghammer" named Bruel Sunderchin. Reaching out to his network of lowlifes and cutthroats, Sunderchin became ringleader of an annual gladiatorial tournament that caters expressly to Exandria's wealthiest elite.

Those who have become invested members of the league's events are anonymously delivered a golden coin bearing their symbol in the weeks leading up to an event. These coins are required for entry into the events, and those who wish to join, whether as a patron or participant, require a coin of their own.

#### Goals

The "Brawler's League" is always in search of hidden and well-guarded locations around Tal'Dorei (and sometimes other realms) to establish their semi-annual event. A combatant or team is required to have a known and cleared sponsor or manager to enter the event. There are two tiers of bouts; one tier has teams of six battling via single elimination until a victor is declared. The other features single combatants fighting one-on-one, single-elimination, until a victor is declared. Killing your opponents isn't encouraged, but isn't explicitly discouraged, either. Bets are placed in person at the event, or remotely (via arcane messages and [sending stones](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sending-stones.md)) from all around Exandria.

![A black circle outlined in...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-brawlers.webp#center "A black circle outlined in silver that appears like a shield, embossed in silver.")

#### Relationships

The "Brawler's League" is extremely illegal in all major cities across Tal'Dorei. Should law-keepers of any nation discover the location of the semiannual event, the venue would find itself swiftly strangled by the long arm of the law. As such, magical protections and sentinels are placed throughout the event to prevent any unapproved entry, or to wipe the memory of those that do infiltrate.

A common rumor states that numerous political figures who publicly decry the event secretly partake in the gambling, and that the location of the event is concealed not only by magic, but also impenetrable layers of bureaucracy. "Kraghammer" has hosted the event a number of times, with most local guards and great houses turning a blind eye.

The "Brawler's League" frequently hires local "Clasp" agents (or "Myriad" operatives, in a pinch) to spread word of their next event through the criminal underground. If all goes well, they get hired at the event itself to provide protection, run interference, and make money on the side by providing loans and taking bets.

##### Oben "Broadstaff" Sunderchin

*Dwarf organizer and head of "Brawler's League"*

Descendant of Bruel and inheritor of the league's top position, Oben secretly goes by the name Broadstaff and doesn't directly appear at events, as he avoids public connection with the league.

##### Kradin Grimthorne

Dwarf fight manager

A previously disgraced dwarf, exiled from "Kraghammer" for murder, Grimthorne is the foremost brawler talent scout in Tal'Dorei.

### Chamber of Whitestone

Generations ago, a team of intrepid explorers and fortune-seekers sailed from Port Damali in "Wildemount" to northeastern Tal'Dorei through the "Shearing Channel", but wrecked upon the "Alabaster Sierras'" rocky cliffs. The expedition was led by the de Rolo family, and these brave "humans" led the survivors to safety after the wreck. They took refuge in a valley within the "Alabaster Sierras", and there they discovered the holy "Sun Tree", a radiant tree blessed by the Dawnfather. A community grew around the "Sun Tree", and the respected and beloved de Rolos were asked by their shipwrecked allies to be the leaders of this new settlement. Pressed against the chalky cliffs of the "Alabaster Sierras", their new homeland was dubbed "Whitestone".

The sovereign city-state of "Whitestone" enjoyed peace for many generations, secluded from the rest of Tal'Dorei and "Wildemount". This serenity was destroyed when Lord Sylas and Lady Delilah Briarwood arrived in "Whitestone" and murdered most of the de Rolo family. Lady Delilah, a necromancer of The Whispered One and a disgraced member of the Cerberus Assembly in "Wildemount", and her husband, a power-hungry [vampire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire.md), transformed the quiet city-state into a realm of death. They attempted to take control of all of Tal'Dorei by puppeteering the Last Sovereign, Uriel Tal'Dorei II, but were thwarted by Vox Machina.

Thirty years after "Whitestone's" fall, the "Briarwoods" and their sepulchral master are defeated, and "Whitestone" has returned to the blessed peace of its past. Nevertheless, much has changed. The surviving de Rolo siblings, [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) and Cassandra, reclaimed the city with the aid of Vox Machina. With the tyrants dethroned, [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) established a council titled the Chamber of "Whitestone" to rule in his frequent absence, and the city now sends a delegation to the "Tal'Dorei Council" to help safeguard the republic against evil.

![The Whitestone heraldry ou...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-whitestone.webp#center "The Whitestone heraldry outlined, first in gold, then blue. In the center of the interior is a large golden tree, a solid canopy of green above it and a light purple below, composing the ground. Under it are six eight-pointed stars. Above the tree is a yellow sun with eight orange rays emanating from it.")

#### Goals

Under the watch of Lady Cassandra de Rolo, the chamber handles and surveys all aspects of political life in "Whitestone". Its members are appointed by the head of the chamber, who is likely to be a scion of the de Rolo family for generations to come. The head can also add or remove members from the council. This system is new and untested by a ruler less noble than [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) or Cassandra. In many ways, this system of government is another one of [Percy's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) tinkering projects.

Members of the Chamber are granted distinct areas of responsibility to the realm.

**The Guardian of Woven Stone** is the title given to the central figure on the council, responsible for higher civil justice, community unification, and oversight of internal government.

**The Steward of Sunblessed Gifts** is responsible for local farming and goods, overseeing distribution between citizens and exportation.

**The Curator of Fortune's Bounty** is responsible for all major commerce and economic business, both locally and with allied and foreign entities.

**The Keeper of Divine Virtue** is responsible for religious organization and spiritual guidance regarding multiple faiths within the region, both as a religious leader and a protector of practices.

**The Commissioner of Wardship** is responsible for the enforcement of local law, the organization of the Paleguard, acting as judge on smaller matters of civil justice, and defense of the city during times of war.

**The Architect of Enlightened Progress** is responsible for the construction and infrastructure of the city and castle.

**The Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt** is responsible for diplomatic relations and for rooting out dangers beyond the city's walls.

#### Relationships

Despite its benefits, "Whitestone's" previous solitary existence left it without allies in its time of need. The Chamber of "Whitestone" has sent a delegation to the "Tal'Dorei Council" for the betterment of both. These days, trade caravans are a common sight along the "Silvercut Roadway", transporting goods from "Whitestone" to "Westruun", "Kymal", and ultimately "Emon". The most expensive goods travel via [skyships](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md), which land at "Whitestone's" brand-new skyport.

##### Lady Cassandra Johanna de Rolo, Guardian of Woven Stone

*Human head of the "Chamber of Whitestone"*

Cassandra is [Percival's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) younger sister, thought dead until he discovered her in the thrall of the "Briarwoods". She now manages "Whitestone's" most pressing matters, with daily briefings from other members of the chamber. She is beloved throughout the city for her resilience and her decisive leadership.

##### Lord Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, Architect of Enlightened Progress

*Human member of the "Chamber of Whitestone"*

[Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) is Cassandra's older brother, thought dead until Vox Machina discovered him in a prison cell. His life was filled with countless joys and regrets. He has taken well to retirement from adventuring, and is renowned across Tal'Dorei for his creations.

##### Lady Vex'ahlia de Rolo, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt

*Half-Elf Member of the "Chamber of Whitestone"*

[Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) is the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt, a title she has held since before she married [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md). Over the past twenty-four years, she has become a talented and respected leader of the "Grey Hunters". And though the hunters use guns inspired by her husband's own designs, she still prefers to wield her trusty bow.

##### Grog Strongjaw, Grand Poobah de Doink, In Charge of All This-and-That

*Goliath friend*

The noble, if simple, warrior of Vox Machina, no one really knows if [Grog's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grog-strongjaw-tdcsr.md) title is a real title at all, or if [Percy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) was just joking when he gave it to him. [Grog](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grog-strongjaw-tdcsr.md) likes it, and that's good enough for most people.

### Claret Orders

> [!quote]- A quote from From The Crimson Canon  
> 
> As blood flows through and invigorates the body, so faith flows through and invigorates the soul. Ever remember this: your blood and your faith are one and the same. Spill not your blood nor that of another heedlessly, but do not hesitate to spill either when the cause is just.

^084

Hundreds of years ago, a fell power exerted its dark will over "Wildemount", corrupting its outlying townships and spreading chaos among its people. Undeath washed over gravesites like a plague, shadowed beasts stalked the midnight woods, and the influence of fiends befouled even "Wildemount's" purest souls.

In the eleventh hour, a priest of the Matron of Ravens named Trence Orman prayed for a way to protect his flock. The Matron's inspiration came in the form of long-hidden knowledge: the secrets to blood magic. Taking his gifts, Trence trained his most trusted warriors in these techniques, giving a portion of their humanity in exchange for the power to defend their people. This marked the origin of the "Claret Orders", and the first "Blood Clerics", "Blood Mages", and Blood Hunters.

The "Claret Orders" work in relative secrecy, as the nature of their abilities is largely misunderstood, which often leads to persecution. Their numbers are small, as the price is great and the "Orders" only accept those who are strong of heart and have little to lose. Small sects of the "Orders" have begun work far enough West to wander the lands of Tal'Dorei in recent years, keeping out of the public eye and remaining vigilant to the signs of familiar darkness undermining the region.

Despite the "Claret Orders'" best attempts at secrecy, the esoteric art of blood magic has escaped their clutches. Though rare, rogue blood mages and blood hunters have spread across both "Wildemount" and Tal'Dorei, unbound by the tenets and strictures of the "Claret Orders".

#### Goals

The Creed of the "Claret Orders" asks that its followers commit their lives to the hunt of entities and creatures that threaten the sanctity of life and joy. While the sacrifice is great, the reward is the continued existence of purity and good in the world. The "Orders" strive to protect those who cannot protect themselves from the shadows, taking no credit for their services beyond the means to live and travel. Some have strayed, focusing on building a fortune for themselves, but should word of such intent make it back to the heads of the "Orders", and their actions begin to threaten the innocents they've sworn to protect, they may find themselves among the hunted.

#### Relationships

The "Claret Orders" have no alliance with—nor allegiance to—any standing government or group. Solitary in action and discreet in display, they've not drawn the attention of many factions in Tal'Dorei as of yet. However, it is only a matter of time before curious eyes begin to seek answers to questions about these dark guardians and their true nature.

![A symbol composed of one l...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-claretorders.webp#center "A symbol composed of one lone, bloodred teardrop on the bottom, with a grey dagger on top.")

##### Claret Director Alasterre de Vitrevos

*Human Blood Domain cleric of Ravens*

Calm and sanguine to a fault, "Alasterre de Vitrevos" is the youngest-ever director of Tal'Dorei's "Claret Order". He sees his position as one he deserves without question, and is willing to use his command more boldly than his mentor, director emeritus Teresa Dulamar. He is frequently seen in the field, working with various adventuring parties and his own blood hunters to wipe out monsters wherever they emerge. The combination of his relaxed personality and his aggressive strategy may seem a contradiction at first glance, but those who know him see the truth of the immense self-assurance that lets him make hard decisions without hesitation. This quality is a strength when cool-headed leadership is needed in the thick of battle, but it can make him challenging to work with as an equal.

##### Director Emeritus Teresa Dulamar

*Dwarf Blood Domain cleric of Ravens*

The former head of Tal'Dorei's "Claret Orders" retired ten years ago after suffering a traumatic death in combat. Her soul accepted resurrection, but she took her defeat as a sign to let younger, fresher blood take her place. She remains a part of the "Claret Orders" to advise the current director on matters he is too young to have experienced himself. Though she displays a chilly demeanor, she simply keeps her compassionate side hidden from the untrusted riffraff.

##### Hunter Jorick LaMensh

*Human blood hunter*

Once among the greatest of all blood hunters, Jorick is now Director Emeritus Teresa Dulamar's personal bodyguard. He is still a capable member of the Order of the Profane Soul, and urges immediate, decisive action to destroy demons and devils whenever their occult activity is discovered.

### The Clasp

The "Clasp" is a well-established secret organization consisting of spies, thieves, fences, assassins, saboteurs, and smugglers. It was built upon the ruins of the Winksman Thieves' Guild, an organization that flourished during the reign of "Drassig", but crumbled under the rule of "Zan Tal'Dorei". Based largely in "Emon"—and under it, via a network of subterranean tunnels—the "Clasp" also runs smaller outfits in "Westruun", "Stilben", and "Kymal". Members are branded with the guild's symbol on their mid-back, signifying allegiance and commitment. The "Clasp" operates like a business-minded family or mafia, celebrating loyalty and an ability to keep one's word. A member pays their debts, keeps their promises, and always seeks opportunity for the betterment of the "Clasp".

Leaders of a "Clasp" sect bear the title of Spireling, and they oversee assigned elements of the organization's functions. Spirelings hold equal power within a sect, and there is always an odd number acting within that location to break any disagreements over business ventures and actions.

#### Goals

While most common folk assume that the "The Clasp" is merely interested in profit at any cost (and that is a merit of the "The Clasp"), they also wish to preserve the function and prosperity of civilization. It is commonly held that a thriving city is a profitable one, and an enemy of civilization is a foe of the "The Clasp". They largely consider themselves a necessary dark underbelly, willing to do the under-the-table deeds that more wealthy and powerful citizens cannot commit with their own hands. On the other hand, less scrupulous Spirelings also understand that discontent breeds profit, and have occasionally kindled the flames of unrest to keep things tense and profitable.

Were it not for the branch of the "The Clasp" in "Emon", the "Chroma Conclave's" attack would likely have destroyed the city's culture entirely. However, thanks to the "Clasp's" role as a "shadow civilization," the people of "Emon" were able to maintain their foothold at home, even under the watchful eye of "Thordak, the Cinder King".

![The symbol of the Clasp: A...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-clasp.webp#center "The symbol of the Clasp: A stylized dark-red dagger entwined with the letter 'C'.")

#### Relationships

A generation ago, the "Clasp" was considered by most to be an uncouth cesspool of cutthroats and criminals. These days, thousands of people know the "Clasp" as the roguish heroes who saved their lives, or the lives of their parents, from the "Chroma Conclave". Nowhere is this truer than in "Emon", where its Spirelings make public appearances and even, on occasion, deal openly with the "Tal'Dorei Council". Nevertheless, "Clasp" agents outside of "Emon" keep their wits about them, for most local governments still view them as underhanded scoundrels—and not without reason. Most guards and town militias will arrest known "Clasp" members on sight; however, most "Clasp" members know well enough to have a friend on the force that will help them escape.

The "Clasp" frowns upon dogmatic religion or cultish behavior, as it has conflicted with the organization's business in the past, and always ended messily.

Since the arrival of the "Myriad" within Tal'Dorei from "Wildemount", the "Clasp" has been on extremely high alert, seeking information on them and any means of banishing this new competition. Gang warfare has broken out sporadically between the "Clasp" and the "Myriad" in cities from "Stilben" to "Emon" over the past twenty years, and though the rival organizations are currently at peace, everyone knows the whole thing is just one poached client away from reigniting.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Clasp" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### Spireling Shenn

*Human Spireling of Secrets ("Emon")*

A powerful illusionist, Shenn runs a far-reaching network of spies and informants. In his younger days, he was a canny negotiator who sought to spread the "Clasp" beyond Tal'Dorei. The arrival of the "Myriad" forced the "Clasp" onto the defensive, and he will never forgive them for souring his ambitions.

##### Spireling Warren

*Half-orc Spireling of Blades ("Emon")*

Deadly duelist turned master assassin of the "Clasp", Warren handles all contracts that involve kidnapping, assassination, and intimidation. He hates public appearances.

##### Spireling Zilloa

*Half-elf Spireling of Shadows ("Emon")*

An accomplished burglar, Zilloa has risen to the head of all thieving, smuggling, and black-market dealings within the "Clasp" of "Emon". She plays a dangerous game by enjoying folk-hero status as the public liaison between the "Clasp" and the "Tal'Dorei Council".

##### Spireling Gholesh

*Human Spireling of Shadows ("Westruun")*

A crass and ambitious man, Gholesh's appearance is a mystery as his face is always hidden behind a leather mask that resembles an ogre. He has secretly thrown in his lot with the "League of Miracles" and, with their backing, he aspires to take over the "Clasp" and enjoy all its wealth and prestige.

##### Spireling Melchior

*Tiefling Spireling of Blades ("Westruun")*

This clean-faced, curly-haired tiefling with pale blue skin and stubby horns may have a soft, babyish visage, but it belies their powerful physique. They are equally skilled with a sword, axe, or bow, and made their name in underground brawling rings before joining the "Clasp".

##### Spireling Fetch

*Halfling Spireling of Secrets ("Westruun")*

Creepy and unkempt in appearance, Fetch's gaunt face only distracts from his cunning and skills of keen manipulation.

### Golden Grin

In dark times, entertainment and good cheer are just as vital as resistance. During the despotic rule of King Warren "Drassig" and his sons, a group of bards, dancers, and storytellers united to subvert his rule and inspire the people to rise against him. This band took the name "the "Golden Grin"" and traveled across the realm to offer escapism and entertainment, all while planting the seeds of discontent, rebellion, and heroism.

Since the fall of "Drassig", the "Golden Grin" has been ever-present, using song, comedy, and theatrics to inspire the people of Tal'Dorei to endure hardship and fight back against evil. These "Grinners" include among their ranks spiritual leaders, artists, musicians, innkeepers, and dozens of retired adventurers who still want to do good outside the public eye. Little is publicly known about the "Golden Grin", other than myths and rumors, and the Grinners gladly perpetuate these tall tales.

![A dusty-gold diamond crest...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-goldengrin.webp#center "A dusty-gold diamond crest. Its interior bears a golden curved, crescent shape with a golden circle on top and a golden, upside-down triangle below it.")

#### Goals

The "Golden Grin" (or simply "the Grin") exists to enlighten and inspire, keeping ears and eyes out for the murmurs of tyranny and cruelty. The Grin's core philosophy is that each and every person is capable of great things alone, and even greater things together. Rather than taking direct action themselves, most Grinners use songs and tales of great heroes to galvanize people to action.

#### Relationships

The "Golden Grin" claims no formal allies, nor do members reveal their secret affiliation to outsiders unless circumstances are dire indeed. They use their covert, grassroots power to empower local freedom fighters and activists. Some Grinners do occasionally find their way into government, granting them a higher vantage point and platform to disseminate the ideals behind their cause—but even these members of the Grin take a dim view of the slowly turning gears of bureaucracy.

Enemies of the "Golden Grin" are those that oppress and abuse freedom of expression and living. The Grin likewise mistrusts people and institutions that control or regulate the populace too heavily, even if they seem to have the best of intentions.

##### Theona Balmhand

*Gnome cleric of the Lawbearer*

A wandering healer hailing from "Kymal", Theona lives by donation and perpetually travels from place to place, seeking to aid who she can and to learn whatever the people whisper.

##### Doctor Dranzel

*Half-orc traveling bard*

A jovial and lackadaisical violinist and frontman for Doctor Dranzel's Traveling Troupe, the renowned Doctor Dranzel exaggerates his stage persona for a number of reasons, not the least of which is to make him seem like a preening fool—the perfect cover for a master spy of the Grin.

### Houses of Kraghammer

The fortified, subterranean city-state of "Kraghammer" was carved out of the bedrock of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" in the years following the "Divergence". It is the ancestral home of the native "dwarves" of Tal'Dorei, and the five major bloodlines that founded the city in ages past still rule to this day. The ruling families are Houses Greyspine, Zuurthom, Bronzegrip, Thunderbrand, and Glorendar. These Great Houses elect an official to the office of Ironkeeper every ten years to keep the alliances between houses just and healthy.

Though the culture of "Kraghammer" is highly traditional and as stoic as the stone it was carved from, it is not without unrest. It seems every dwarven generation has its own great social movement where disenfranchised workers or greedy, lesser noble houses attempt to unseat the ruling five. Yet for good or for ill, the Great Houses have time and time again shown that they can put aside their differences to preserve their mutual rulership.

#### Goals

Each ruling house has a specialty and holds responsibility over that domain within "Kraghammer". House Greyspine maintains the largest mine under "Kraghammer", as well as the Pools of Solace. House Zuurthom trains the chief architects of the city, and most masonry and building is organized through them. House Bronzegrip funds the smithing guilds and maintains the Bronzegrip Metalworks, "Kraghammer's" largest blast furnace and ore refinery. House Thunderbrand prides itself on training "Kraghammer's" foremost scholars and premiere arcanists. House Glorendar maintains the law and delivers punishment.

#### Relationships

Almost every dwarf living in "Kraghammer" can remember a time when, "Kraghammer for the dwarves!" was a common cheer at the pubs. And when they said, "for the dwarves," they meant just the "dwarves" born in "Kraghammer". Times have changed. The prevailing opinion is that a unified Tal'Dorei is best for all. Those "dwarves" whose traditionalism is just a veil for bigotry have found that they aren't welcome in "Kraghammer"—they've subsequently retreated to make their own isolated enclaves in the "Cliffkeeps".

The "Houses of Kraghammer" facilitate a healthy trade of metals, weapons, and armor with "Emon" and "Westruun". These bonds of commerce and communication have only grown stronger since an ambassador from "Kraghammer" has taken a seat on the "Tal'Dorei Council".

Many members of House Thunderbrand also have ties to the "Arcana Pansophical". However, lesser clans with aspirations of supplanting the renowned Thunderbrands have thrown their lot in with the "League of Miracles", hoping to become the new masters of the arcane. They have been wooed by to this upstart faction with promises of disrupting the old ways of commerce and prestige, establishing something new.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Houses of Kraghammer" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### Ironkeeper Palluda Zuurthom

*Dwarf Ironkeeper of House Zuurthom*

Even after weathering the "Chroma Conclave", uniting "Kraghammer's" squabbling houses in support of the "Tal'Dorei Council" was no mean feat. Ironkeeper Palluda of House Zuurthom proved up to the task. They made a name for themself by taking control of a trade deal that ultimately sold tens of thousands of gold pieces' worth of quarried stone to the "League of Miracles", which began the reconstruction of Tal'Dorei in earnest. Palluda became a hero of the working dwarf within "Kraghammer". They are a master at getting all sides to agree to a compromise, and do so with an iron-edged smile.

##### Lord Nostoc Greyspine

*Dwarf overseer of House Greyspine*

The dour executive of dozens of quarries across the "Cliffkeep Mountains", Nostoc makes up for his unpleasant personality by being a formidable businessman. In recent years, he has become fabulously wealthy as the reconstruction of cities across Tal'Dorei devoured thousands of tons of stone. House Thunderbrand and the "League of Miracles" made it possible to transport it all with teleportation spells.

##### Elementalist Drake Thunderbrand

One of the eldest of his House, Drake is known for his surprising empathy and fierce temper. He is also a member of the "Arcana Pansophical". His friendship with "Allura Vysoren" made him a popular choice for "Kraghammer's" ambassador to the council, but he politely refused, claiming it was a younger dwarf's duty.

### League of Miracles

"Magic isn't cheap, but miracles are priceless." Such is the credo of the "Wonderworker", the mysterious thaumaturge whose words inspire and guide the "League of Miracles". This company of mercenary magi is the reason why Tal'Dorei has recovered so rapidly from the near-apocalyptic destruction of the "Chroma Conclave". "Westruun" and "Emon" rose from rubble to the height of their former glory in a matter of months.

The people of Tal'Dorei adore the league. Their mighty spellwrought [adranachs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/adranach-tdcsr.md) can be seen lifting thousand-pound bricks of limestone high into the sky to rebuild walls, towers, and even castles in a matter of days. Many of the league's spellwrights have become folk heroes and celebrities for their miraculous acts, which range from healing those maimed in the "Conclave's" attack to transmuting raw timber, mud, and straw into full-fledged houses in minutes.

For most of Tal'Dorei's elite, the "League of Miracles" is likewise a great ally. Trade and travel have resumed stronger than before, for the league has eagerly subcontracted their talented mages out as guards for caravans and persons of interest.

Yet, not everyone sees the league as an ally. In the early aftermath of "Thordak's" defeat, the new and untested "Tal'Dorei Council" put out thousands of bounties on reconstruction projects to get their towns and cities back on their feet, and local mayors and margraves across the nation agreed to these subsidies to reduce the cost of reconstruction for their already devastated populace. They expected Tal'Dorei's rebirth to be a multi-generational undertaking—yet the "League of Miracles" snapped up these bounties like candy, and the league does not work their miracles cheaply. Bills for hundreds of thousands of gold pieces' worth of bounties found their way to the desks of local leaders and to the "Tal'Dorei Council" by the end of the year. Such vast wealth for thirty years' worth of rebuilding in three years' time simply did not exist.

But this was all part of the "Wonderworker's" plan, and their spellwrights executed it flawlessly. The league needs money to purchase their expensive spell components and to pay their talented mercenary membership, of course, but their true goal is the priceless currency of power, in the form of political favors from leaders ranging from small-town mayors, to city-ruling margraves, and even delegates to the "Tal'Dorei Council". Rumors even swirl that one or more of the members of the council itself are in the league's pocket.

The league's members are delineated into a simple hierarchy.

#### Mercenary Mage

Spellcasters drawn from across Tal'Dorei form the backbone of the "League of Miracles". The league works as an agency, handing mercenaries lucrative jobs, collecting the payment themselves, and paying out in a timely fashion—minus twenty percent. These mercenaries come from all walks of life. Some are aspiring adventurers seeking a less life-threatening first gig, while others are skilled arcanists with shady pasts, including [Remnant cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/remnant-cultist-tdcsr.md) and double-dipping "Myriad" agents with a talent for magic.

#### Spellwright

The most talented (or best-connected) members of the league are awarded the title of spellwright. Only two dozen such masters of the arcane exist across Tal'Dorei. These spellwrights know the secrets of how to create [adranachs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/adranach-tdcsr.md), mighty constructs of magical energy that were used publicly to rebuild Tal'Dorei's ravaged infrastructure—and are also used in secret as hunter-destroyers of the league's enemies. These spellwrights sign a blood pact that connects their minds to the mysterious communications of the "Wonderworker", which all spellwrights are blood-bound to interpret and enact.

#### Grand Thaumaturge

The official title of the league's shadowy master is the Grand Thaumaturge, though most colloquially refer to them as the "Wonderworker". None know their true identity, or their ultimate goal. The spellwrights understand that the Grand Thaumaturge has a master plan that must be followed. Only these spellwrights have the privilege of hearing their master's psychic messages. Over the years, they have interpreted them to mean that the "League of Miracles" must become the secret puppet-masters of all Tal'Dorei.

![The symbol of the League o...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-miracles.webp#center "The symbol of the League of Miracles: a pale stone castle tower encircled by two ethereal purple hands.")

#### Goals

The "League of Miracles" is comprised mostly of mercenary magi pulled from all corners of Tal'Dorei, with some even coming from abroad as news of the league's reputation spreads across Exandria. For most of these arcanists, their goal is simple: to make money. The goals of the league's spellwrights are more elaborate. They listen for the cryptic words of the mysterious Grand Thaumaturge and dedicate themselves to deciphering and enacting their grand design. The spellwrights' current aim is one of total control—once all of Tal'Dorei's social and political elite are in their pockets, they can shape the land as they see fit, all to the cheering adoration of the fawning people of Tal'Dorei.

#### Relationships

The "League of Miracles" tries to keep cordial, if distant, relationships with every major power on Tal'Dorei. Their public image is shiny and unimpeachable. Many members of the "Tal'Dorei Council" are already in their pocket and cast votes that further the league's self-interest. The "Arcana Pansophical"—especially "Allura Vysoren", who also sits on the council—are deeply distrustful of this unregulated, uncommonly powerful organization.

The "League of Miracles" has a tense relationship with the "Chamber of Whitestone", as they have long sought access to the [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) unique to that territory. The spellwrights fear outright hostility with the legendary heroes of Vox Machina, and have supposedly abandoned their quest to mine "Whitestone's" naturally occurring [residuum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/residuum-tdcsr.md).

As "no questions asked" employers of mages, the league is in the good graces of many less scrupulous arcane factions, including the "Remnants". Necromancers, blood mages, Ruidus cultists, and other unsavory magi now exist under the league's protection.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "League of Miracles" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### The Wonderworker

*Mysterious enactor of true miracles*

All spellwrights hear the authoritative—yet enigmatically distorted—voice of the "Wonderworker". The "Wonderworker" has supposedly appeared in the flesh only three times throughout the league's twenty-four-year history, as a humanoid draped in robes of starlight and wearing a mithral mask. In those moments, they have produced true miracles—raising a castle from the ground in a matter of seconds, halting the rampaging silver dragon Saldarthoryn in her tracks and healing her twisted mind, and stopping the Center Slab of "Kraghammer" from collapsing into the Pits in a catastrophic mining accident that would have cost countless lives. These legendary acts inspired utmost awe and faith in all who witnessed them, leading the spellwrights to create [adranachs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/adranach-tdcsr.md) in the "Wonderworker's" image and enact their cryptic will.

##### Blaine Kraverrogg

*Half-halfling mercenary necromancer*

Short and brimming with a malign lust for power, Blaine appears to be a short, skeletally skinny human who hides his lack of stature in billowing black-and-gold robes. He is a member of the "Remnants", but pays his bills by doing undercover grave-robbing for the league. He longs to reach the bottom of "Shadebarrow", a mysterious crypt somewhere on the "Dividing Plains". His obsession with "Shadebarrow" stems from a hunger for the power of the Demon Prince of Undeath.

##### Honor Kinnabari

*Tiefling blood mage and novice spellwright*

As the newest spellwright in the "League of Miracles", "Honor Kinnabari" has a lot to prove. She was granted a chance to prove her quality in the eyes of the "Wonderworker" when the league was contracted to rebuild the Market Ward of "Westruun" after it was devastated by a herd of [magma landsharks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magma-landshark-tdcsr.md) that descended from the "Cliffkeep Mountains". Her red eyes and sheet-white skin and horns complement a traditional red-and-white mage's robe from the reclusive dwarven clans of the "Alabaster Sierras". She is fully dedicated to the league, but she is as honorable as her name implies; her fellow spellwrights fear that she could turn traitor, should the unsavory truth of the league be laid plain before her.

### Library of the Cobalt Soul

The Cobalt Reserve in "Westruun" is home to a monastic order so old, enduring, and tirelessly dedicated to the preservation of knowledge that most people in Tal'Dorei simply take it for granted. Just as birds have always flown and grass has always grown, the Library of the Cobalt Soul has always sent its agents across the world, taking minutes at public trials, archiving broadsheets, exploring ancient ruins, and copying scrolls. To all but the most dedicated scholars, the work of the Cobalt Soul seems like dreary, banal stuff.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Beneath the veneer of being a dopey order of bookish monks, the Cobalt Soul is one of the most dogged espionage organizations in the world. The secret agents of the Cobalt Soul, its expositors, are spies who wield the truth as a weapon more potent than any blade. The Cobalt Soul was born in "Wildemount", just after the end of the "Calamity", when the Knowing Mentor was maimed by an evil god. Her most loyal followers went into hiding and vowed to continue her divine work in knowing all there is to be known—and most importantly, to use the truth as a holy weapon against lies and propaganda.

Each archive of the Cobalt Soul has a common hierarchy, and higher-ranking members of the Cobalt Soul can command their lower-ranking comrades from another archive.

#### Monk

The monks of the Cobalt Soul are their most visible members, for they travel the land in search of knowledge both modern and archaic. Not all monks are engaged in fieldwork, especially new recruits. Those who work entirely within an archive aid in the organization and preservation of information. Few know that these monks are dedicated to the Knowing Mentor; the common opinion in Tal'Dorei is that they are ascetics, obsessively dedicated to the chronicling of knowledge, not devotees of an obscure god.

#### Expositor

Trained in the art of espionage, the expositors of the Cobalt Soul use their infiltration expertise to uncover the secrets of governments, world leaders, and obscure cults. In times of great crisis, undercover expositors have even incited revolutions by sharing the knowledge they discovered with people toiling under evil regimes. This true mission of the expositors is a secret even to low-ranking monks, who see them simply as well-trained field agents.

#### Archivist

Though they are not involved in field work, archivists play the vital role of organizing the overwhelming flow of information that the monks and expositors return to their archive. They also train new monks and perform administrative tasks, like negotiating with sellers of artifacts and with government officials to ensure the stability of their archive.

#### Curator

A small group of three to five curators manage the top-level operations of each archive. One of their number is given the special designation of High Curator, to whom all other members of their archive must ultimately answer.

![A circle of inlaid black a...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-cobaltsoul.webp#center "A circle of inlaid black and teal marble with silver designs of three circles, one on each point of a triangle, and writing in an unknown language. Around the top half of the outer circle are the words &quot;From the Archives of the Cobalt Soul.&quot;")

![Sigil of the Cobalt Soul: Watermark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-cobaltsoulminimal.webp#center)

#### Goals

The public mission statement of the Cobalt Soul is to archive knowledge for the betterment of all peoples of Exandria. The secret mission of the Cobalt Soul is to use their accumulated knowledge to root out tyranny and ensure the freedom of all people.

As instructed by their reclusive god, the Knowing Mentor, the Cobalt Soul in Tal'Dorei makes their archives available to everyone, so that knowledge can be used to improve and enrich the lives of all. Despite this, the curators of the Cobalt Reserve privately determine what knowledge is too volatile to be freely disseminated. Typically, this privileged information is magical in nature, but it also includes secrets recovered by expositors that must be strategically employed as a weapon against unjust leaders, cults, and power-hungry factions.

The Cobalt Soul itself is not immune to corruption and complacency. Nowhere is this truer than in the Cobalt Soul's birthplace of "Wildemount", where it must work hand-in-hand with the authoritarian Dwendalian Empire. Its highest officials say that the Cobalt Soul has outlasted every tyrant on Exandria, and that they must be content with small acts of insurrection—subtly subverting propaganda and sharing the truth with any who will listen—while waiting for the right moment to strike a fatal blow. Nevertheless, this mantra of patience has caused some of its more radical members to abandon the order entirely. Typically, deserters of the Cobalt Soul are expositors, who see the ugliest side of the world firsthand again and again.

#### Relationships

The Cobalt Soul is an international organization with archives in the Dwendalian Empire and Clovis Concord of "Wildemount", the Republic of Tal'Dorei, the Dawn City of Vasselheim on "Issylra", and the great city of "Ank'Harel" on "Marquet". Each of these archives acts independently under the orders of their commanding High Curator, though they must ultimately answer to the joint leadership of the Cobalt Soul: the High Curators of the Rexxentrum and Vasselheim archives.

Though Tal'Dorei is a freer society than the Dwendalian Empire, the Cobalt Soul knows better than to think that means it is free of corruption. From the Cobalt Reserve, their archive in the city of "Westruun", the Cobalt Soul keeps close tabs on members of the "Tal'Dorei Council", the leaders of "Syngorn" and "Kraghammer", and other powerful individuals across the land.

The Cobalt Soul actively opposes the "Remnants"—followers of The Whispered One, a tyrannical god of secrets who is diametrically opposed to the goals of the Knowing Mentor. They are also concerned by the meteoric rise of a guild of arcanists called the "League of Miracles", whose political maneuverings have made puppets of dozens of delegates to the "Tal'Dorei Council" and political leaders across the land. This worry has only deepened as rumors reach them of the league filling their ranks with [Remnant cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/remnant-cultist-tdcsr.md) who seek to dominate Tal'Dorei.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Library of the Cobalt Soul" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### High Curator Greisalda Cassios

*Half-"dragonblood" leader of the Cobalt Reserve*

The High Curator of the "Westruun" archive of the "Cobalt Soul" is a high-cheekboned, bald woman who would appear fully human if not for her slitted, silver eyes and the silver scales that run across her head, neck, and upper arms. She is regarded as one of the fastest minds in Tal'Dorei, for she has the rare gift of perfect recall. Monks tremble when her clear, unpretentious voice rings through an archive chamber, for Greisalda remembers acts of justice and personal slights with equal intensity, making her a powerful ally and a furious enemy. She is concerned that corruption is spreading throughout the "Tal'Dorei Council".

##### Cressida Holt

*Orc expositor of the Cobalt Reserve*

The name "Cressida Holt" is synonymous with style and effortless charisma—and also a blunt, merciless coldness. "Cressida" is nonbinary, and uses both she and they pronouns interchangeably. Though she's fresh blood to the expositors of the Cobalt Reserve, she has already taken advantage of her license to kill on her espionage missions. They are slim for an orc, but still more muscular than many of their human colleagues. Their assignments take them across Tal'Dorei in search of political corruption. She is currently stationed in "Emon" to observe a person of interest on the "Tal'Dorei Council", where she alternates between lurking on rooftops and striding through ballrooms in fine suits.

##### Archivist Salomane Rothtree

*Half-elf archivist of the Cobalt Reserve*

A haggard, overworked administrator, Archivist Rothtree is known throughout the Cobalt Reserve as someone who tries too hard to prove himself and constantly bites off more than he can chew. Half-orc and half-elf, he has said that he hopes to accomplish as much in his lifetime as an elf could in theirs. He often is tasked with helping adventurers find information. Though he resents the task, he may slowly open up to heroes who treat him well.

### The Myriad

"Wildemount's" greatest organized crime ring is now becoming known throughout Tal'Dorei, but it came from humble beginnings. The Myriad began in the Dwendalian city of Yrrosa, as a small shipping company specializing in exotic goods and services, exploiting and selling curiosities from the distant continents of "Othanzia" and "Ank'Harel". Over time, as legal trading became more difficult, the Myriad's illegal occupations became their best business. Through years establishing underworld contacts and tactical blackmail, the Myriad evolved into a powerful, well-veiled criminal faction. Over the past two decades, the Myriad's aspirations have spread beyond "Wildemount", and they are now deeply entrenched in Tal'Dorei's criminal underworld.

Known for displays of opulence and social grace, this misdirection enables the Myriad to seduce and control the lives and wills of whomever is deemed valuable to their plans. Dozens of truly amoral cutthroats and thieves noticed when the "Clasp" began to work hand-in-hand with the "Tal'Dorei Council". They felt the dagger of accountability pressed against their backs, and broke with their former guild. Now, the Myriad has filled the vacuum of truly lawless criminality that the "Clasp" left in its wake.

The Myriad operates as a loose network of gangs whose bosses run their own localized sects, without direct oversight from the mysterious heads of the society. Tithes and information are expected to be delivered to the leadership at a steady rate from each satellite of the organization, and should the success slow, threats of enslavement or destruction soon follow.

![A sigil of five curved, du...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-myriad.webp#center "A sigil of five curved, dusty gold blades and five smaller, curved blades of onyx, emanating from one red ruby pentagon in the middle - a golden circle directly in the center.")

#### Goals

The "Myriad" seeks wealth in hideous excess. The means are unimportant, as long as they're lucrative. No trade is too abhorrent, from bloody theft to kidnapping and slavery. And though they lack the political capital to bribe and puppeteer politicians the way they did in "Wildemount", the "Myriad" are confident that they can get even the supposedly noble "Tal'Dorei Council" in their pocket.

Most fronts for the "Myriad" are businesses that publicly deal in antiquities and exotic textiles. Behind these masks is a ruthlessly efficient black market of slaves, magical beasts, weapons, and illicit substances. Overt violence tends to draw unwanted attention, and the "Myriad" avoid it when possible, preferring to discredit, blackmail, or frame those who cross them. Should that fail, however, kidnapping or assassination can be a quick and traceless final alternative.

#### Relationships

Though they are relative newcomers to the criminal underworld of Tal'Dorei, the "Myriad" is well-versed in the covert art of making money by any means necessary. The "Clasp" is well aware of their presence in the broadest sense, and the two thieves' guilds have spilled blood in the streets of every city in Tal'Dorei at some point in the past twenty years. These days, the bloodshed has subsided into a cold war of espionage and counter-espionage, as each organization tries to sabotage the other.

The "Myriad" has only been routed from cities a number of times—they no longer have any presence in "Whitestone" or "Syngorn"—and each time, it has been by a concentrated citizens' uprising. In both instances, when they sought the source, "Myriad" leaders were furious to discover an empty safe house containing only a single gold coin, marked by a grinning face: the calling card of the "Golden Grin". Even across the "Lucidian Ocean", the old enmity between the "Myriad" and the "Golden Grin" remains today.

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Myriad" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### Lustran "the Backstabber" Zeth

*Human boss of "Stilben"*

Lustran was one of the first "Clasp" members to turn double agent. By the time anyone realized his betrayal, he had granted the "Myriad" their foothold in Tal'Dorei in the swampy port city of "Stilben". His lean, hungry face and graying hair give him a handsome, intimidating appearance. All "Myriad" agents in Tal'Dorei respect him, and all members of the "Clasp" hate him. He revels in his bad reputation as the renowned Backstabber of "Stilben".

##### Tully "the Conclave of One" Dezzeram

*Gold "dragonblood" boss of "Emon"*

Tully's distasteful nickname delights her inner circle in "Emon's" underground. The "Myriad" boss of "Emon" is a position that usually changes hands by the season, thanks to the diligent efforts of the "Clasp", but Tully has evaded capture for three years, and grown rich and powerful in her reign of smuggling, trafficking, and grand burglary.

##### Sylker "the Millionaire" Uttolot

*Half-elf boss of "Kymal"*

This gold-eyed half-elf, a former underling of the crime families of Shady Creek Run in "Wildemount", joined the "Myriad" and became the first individual on that continent to hoard one million gold pieces. He has a masterful mind for money, and spearheaded the "Myriad's" infiltration of "Kymal". "Gold is a disease," he often says, "and I'm bloody sick."

### The Remnants

In a time long past, an archmage of unparalleled power known as The Whispered One attempted to ascend to godhood by conducting the Ritual of Seeding from high atop the citadel of Thar Ampala within the Plane of Shadow. The Whispered One surrounded himself with a cult of fanatical mages and empowered murderers to protect him during his apotheosis. Despite these protections, he failed. His cult, however, survived, and helped him return to power centuries later, after the defeat of the "Chroma Conclave". He succeeded in his bid for godhood, but was kept from utterly dominating the Material Plane at the last second by Vox Machina, who banished him beyond the Divine Gate, where he was shackled by all the same limitations as the other gods.

His cult, the Remnants, went into hiding once again. Their fanatical ranks, bolstered by his true apotheosis, now seethe in secret, convinced that there is a way to grant their god the ultimate power he sought. Many of them have wormed their way into positions of power within Tal'Dorei's political institutions, churches, arcane organizations, and criminal outfits. Many more have joined up with the dubiously moral, profit-driven arcanists of the "League of Miracles". They exist in shadows, lurking, waiting, longing for a new dark prophet to lead them to glory.

![The crest is composed of o...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/faction-remnants.webp#center "The crest is composed of of a circle on the bottom with four jagged spikes sprouting from the top of it.")

#### Goals

The Whispered One achieved an incomplete victory over twenty years ago, and now his cult is building a new generation of faithful to make his megalomaniacal dreams a reality. The cult's leadership believes that reuniting these malign artifacts will give them greater power to commune with their god and let them begin their quest in earnest to reach him through the Divine Gate. This leadership is known as the Circle of the Dismembered. Each cult leader in the circle commands a branch of the cult, named for a part of The Whispered One's body. These factions are:

##### The Unveiled Sight

Members of this cult are tasked with scouring the planes for arcane lore that could restore their master to the Material Plane.

##### The Mordant Voice

Members of this cult serve their master by infiltrating other factions across Tal'Dorei and subverting their purposes with subtle propaganda.

##### The Devouring Blood

Members of this cult specialize in the art of silent death. They train in stealth and necromancy to become truly horrific assassins.

##### The Unseen Touch

Members of this cult are trained in magic that corrupts the mind and perverts the will, making them vile puppet-masters that prepare the world for their god's return.

##### The Insatiable Heart

Members of this cult do the vital ground-level work of seeking out new blood. They are trained to exploit the emotional weaknesses of their targets to convert them to the cult, without the need of magic.

#### Relationships

The "Remnants" remain largely unknown, even after their master's grand ascension, and wish to keep it that way. Those who are aware of their presence are either cult members or people who have uncovered their insidious existence and wish to stamp it out wherever it may appear. Thus, there are rarely any alliances made by or with the "Remnants".

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Remnants" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### Quinton Puck

*Human jeweler, Master of the Unveiled Sight*

While he runs a middling jewelry business within "Emon", Quinton is secretly the leader of the Unveiled Sight. He is a master of creating and piercing illusions, deciphering ancient script, and all things to do with the magical arts of obscurement and unveiling. He can be recognized by his blood-red spectacles.

##### Ixrattu Khar

*Tiefling vampire, Master of the Devouring Blood*

This escapee from the "Black Bastille" prison in "Emon" is Tal'Dorei's most infamous mass murderer, who once slaughtered and consumed hundreds of innocents on a deadly killing spree from "Kymal" to "Emon". During her imprisonment, Ixrattu was plagued by shadowy visions of a woman beckoning to her from beyond the bars. The visions pointed her towards weaknesses within the "Black Bastille's" guard, and helped her achieve the unthinkable: escape. Once free, she vanished for a year as she scoured the countryside, puzzling over the cryptic whispers of her continuing visions.

At the end of her quest was a fateful discovery: within a lightless underground passage, she found the venomous crossbow [Condemner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/condemner-tdcsr.md), a "Vestige of Divergence". Now she lurks in "Kraghammer", where she trains a network of elite assassins who gleefully dispatch anyone the Unveiled Sight identifies as an enemy of the "Remnants".

![Ixrattu Khar is a grey-ski...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter2-ixrattukhar.webp#center "Ixrattu Khar is a grey-skinned tiefling with long, black hair slicked back between her horns, each of which are adorned by silver chains. She bears a large patch over her left eye, her right eye a solid red. She wears an oil-black leather coat and corset over a blood red shirt. Her left hand brandishes a magical crossbow with an ethereal green string.")

### Wardens of Syngorn

The elven city-state of "Syngorn" was established in the "Verdant Expanse" by the sorceress Yenlara, the wood "elves'" first leader after the "Divergence". Today, the physical and cultural wellbeing of "Syngorn" is safeguarded by the three offices of elders called "Wardens", united by the High Warden. Their primary duty is to protect the city and the surrounding lands from intrusion.

#### Goals

The "Wardens" believe that preserving the ancient culture of "Syngorn" is of utmost importance. Even as their fate grows ever more closely tied to the fate of all Tal'Dorei, the traditions that make "Syngorn" unique must be conserved. The three offices of the "Wardens" are the Verdant Lord, the "Voice of Memory", and the Guildrunner. The office of Verdant Lord commands "Syngorn's" formidable military, which is maintained and scattered throughout the "Verdant Expanse", ready to be called to "Syngorn's" defense at a moment's notice. As preservers of culture, the "Wardens" also encourage public respect for the arts, including the art of magic. It's not uncommon for a "Syngornian" to rise in social status after being publicly praised by a warden for a masterful artistic creation or performance.

Woven around them is a blue crescent moon.")

#### Relationships

"Syngorn" has long been an isolationist society. As a mostly elven enclave, they have often been criticized as xenophobic, or even racist, toward outsiders. There is truth to these claims. Nevertheless, the rise and fall of the "Chroma Conclave" has goaded even some of "Syngorn's" most conservative voices into strengthening the bonds of trade, travel, and kinship with the other free peoples of Tal'Dorei. Even the people of "Kraghammer", who many "elves" still remember siding with the tyrant "Drassig" in centuries past, have been welcomed as friends and allies for the loyalty and courage they displayed in the battle against "Thordak".

#### Figures of Interest

These figures are major members of the "Wardens of Syngorn" that you can use as NPCs in your game. You should also take inspiration from these figures to make up new NPCs for your own campaign.

##### High Warden Tirelda

*Elf Warden of "Syngorn"*

Though she is in her twilight years, even by elven standards, High Warden Tirelda is a trusted descendent of Yenlara, founder of "Syngorn". She is skilled with magic and blessed with calm wisdom. Thus, she was entrusted with the highest level of responsibility amongst the "Wardens"—to maintain law, guide society, and preside over all other "Wardens".

##### Verdant Lord Celindar

*Elf Warden of "Syngorn"*

Head of the Verdant Guard of "Syngorn", and an accomplished warrior in their own right, Celindar handles all military strategy and instruction within the forest's bounds. They only return to "Syngorn" when called by their fellow wardens, and can otherwise constantly be found prowling the "Verdant Expanse". They use any pronouns, and have relinquished any sort of gender presentation after receiving a vision from the Arch Heart.

##### Ouestra, the Voice of Memory

*Elf Warden of "Syngorn"*

A renowned historian and a beloved vocalist, Ouestra is charged with the preservation of "Syngorn's" history and culture. It's said her most magical songs can control moonlight and bring light even to the Abyss itself. These days, she has grown somewhat unpopular by also singing songs of "Syngorn's" darker days, for she says true greatness can only be inspired by learning from failure.

##### Guildrunner Rawndel

*Elf Warden of "Syngorn"*

One of the oldest living "elves" within "Syngorn", Rawndel is more cunning and insightful than most, allowing him to be a very effective head of commerce, business, and the treasury.

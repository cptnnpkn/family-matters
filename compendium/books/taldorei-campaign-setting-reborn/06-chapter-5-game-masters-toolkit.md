# Chapter 5: Game Master's Toolkit
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, p. 192*

Their head glows with radiant light.")

Game Masters can make use of many different tools to run enjoyable games. A GM is the starting point of the storytelling process, coming up with narratively compelling adventure frameworks that they and the players then turn into a campaign. To do so, a GM works up locations and scenarios that their players will have fun with. They stock adventures with loot and magic items to reward daring characters, villains and monsters to defend those valuable treasures, and NPCs of all kinds who can give clues, help as allies, or oppose the characters in their goals.

This chapter contains storytelling advice for GMs running campaigns in Tal'Dorei. It also contains a number of new magic items, including the legendary "Vestiges of Divergence", plus optional rules that GMs can use to fine-tune the tone of a Tal'Dorei campaign. ("Chapter 6" of this book presents monsters and NPCs unique to the world of Exandria, which can likewise help give a campaign a distinctly *Critical Role* feeling.)

## Creating Adventures

Before reading this section, you should familiarize yourself with ""Running a Tal'Dorei Campaign"" in "chapter 1", which provides information about Tal'Dorei's lore and conflicts that are for the Game Master's eyes only. "Chapter 3" of this book also contains dozens of specific story hooks, many of which tie into the big-picture secrets introduced in "chapter 1". Some hooks are simple, giving you just enough to inspire your next game session. Some are more complex, and can cascade into an entire campaign's worth of story.

You'll notice that these story hooks present a beginning, and sometimes a hint of a middle, but never a conclusion. That's because they're designed to spark your imagination, but in a way that still leaves you to fill out the rest of the story framework in your own way. The goal of this book is to provide the building blocks with which you can create your own Tal'Dorei, and these open-ended plot seeds will help you set up adventures that feel right at home in the world of *Critical Role*—whether you're a longtime fan of the show or are brand-new to Tal'Dorei.

If you're an experienced GM, you might already have your own approach to creating adventures from story hooks. But especially if you're a beginning GM, this section presents a straightforward approach you can try out for expanding hooks into full adventures. And even as an experienced GM, if you ever feel stuck while planning an adventure, it can help to create a "fill-in-the-blanks" outline of your narrative. Start by dividing a page of your GM journal (whether it's a physical page or a digital one) into three sections labeled "Beginning," "Middle," and "End." Then think about what happens in each of those parts of your adventure as a means of opening up your creative process.

### Beginning an Adventure

The beginning of most adventures comes when the characters receive a quest or are plunged headfirst into an unexpected scenario. In the Beginning section of your GM journal, write one sentence about how you want the characters to learn of the adventure. For example: "A member of the "Tal'Dorei Council" posts an urgent notice about a dangerous creature in every tavern in "Emon", promising a 1,000 gp reward." Then write down little notes about other things you want in the beginning scene. Where is this opening scene set? What other NPCs are there? Are there environmental notes or clues you want to communicate to the players?

### Creating Conflict in the Middle

The middle of an adventure is filled with conflict, whether episodic events during travel, a dungeon exploration filled with deadly traps and territorial monsters, or intense diplomatic negotiations. In the Middle section, write down notes about what sort of conflict you want your adventure to have. Most story hooks in this book contain a clear antagonist or threat—so start by writing down that antagonist and then brainstorming secondary threats that will challenge the characters on their way to facing their main foe. In addition to the monsters in "chapter 6" of this book, the fifth edition rules are filled with useful monsters that are perfectly at home in Exandria.

### End with a Reward

The end of an adventure is where the characters gain their reward and return to safety. In the Ending section of your journal, write down ideas for treasure or other rewards that you want to give the characters. You can make use of the new treasures featured in this book, as well as the varied rewards described in the fifth edition rules.

Remember that treasure doesn't have to be gold or magic items, and it doesn't have to be found in a dungeon. When the characters return to town carrying the head of the monster they've slain, their quest-giver might grant them an audience with the "Tal'Dorei Council", give them special use of the "Traverse Junction" or some other magical marvel of the "Alabaster Lyceum", or bestow any number of other immaterial rewards.

### Going with the Flow

Don't worry if your plans go awry—they will. No RPG session ever goes totally as planned. The most important skill for any GM is the ability to improvise, because you can never predict everything your players will do. Make your plans loose and variable, and be willing to have fun and change course. Your players are surprised by every challenge you throw at them—so give yourself a chance for the same experience! It can be fun to be surprised, especially when you're the GM who supposedly holds all the important story cards.

## Tal'Dorei Treasures

This section presents magic items for use in your Tal'Dorei campaign, including specific items used by "the Ashari" people of Exandria, and the legendary "Vestiges of Divergence".

### Magic Items

Tal'Dorei is a land awash with magic. Numerous magical organizations, both stately and shadowy, create enchanted items to aid their members in mysterious quests. Shops in major cities, including "Gilmore's Glorious Goods" in "Emon", openly sell magic items to anyone with the gold to pay their extravagant (some might say exorbitant) fees.

GMs can use the magic items in this section—some of which have appeared in *Critical Role* before; some of which are all new—as treasure to reward the characters during their adventures. Unless otherwise stated, these items abide by the magic item rules laid down in the fifth edition core rules.

### Tools of the Ashari

"The Ashari" people have long used their connection and attunement to elemental power to create unique magic items, helping them in their quest to further understand and control the elements. These items are kept secret by their creators and are rarely given to people not of "the Ashari". As such, they can be acquired only as a gift from an Ashari for rendering their people a great service, from the body of a dead Ashari explorer, or for an exorbitant price from someone who has acquired the item through dubious means.

At the GM's discretion, the unique nature of these items might mean that a character not of "the Ashari" and unfamiliar with elemental magic can't automatically attune to them. Such characters can attune to one of the tools of "the Ashari" with 24 hours worth of special training from an Ashari familiar with the item's use.

[Skysail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skysail-tdcsr.md)

### Vestiges of Divergence

During the wars of the "Calamity", destruction rained across the world. Fragmented chronicles of this time recount battles between gods that leveled mountains and sank whole civilizations beneath the waves. Chosen heroes rose up to accept weapons, armor, and other magic items blessed by their patron gods to staunch the inexorable tide of death. Powerful archmages wove the overflowing arcane powers of the war into legendary magic items that could both thwart death and mete it out in equal measure.

These relics of the "Age of Arcanum" armed mortals with god-like powers, and escalated the "Calamity" to a fever pitch. Soon after, the war climaxed in a wave of total destruction that left much of Exandria in ruins. Thousands of years of history were reduced to ash—and in that ash were buried many of these selfsame relics. Some of those not lost were passed down through bloodlines for generations, becoming potent symbols of authority and rulership. Others were sealed away by those who feared their power. These mighty echoes of the war that nearly shattered Exandria and the divine banishment that followed are known as the Vestiges of Divergence.

The Vestiges of Divergence are unique even among legendary magic items, for each one touches the defiant soul of its wielder and grows in power alongside them. The base state of a Vestige of Divergence is its dormant state, which the item returns to if sealed away or otherwise kept from being attuned by a worthy individual for a long period of time. A dormant state still imbues a modicum of power to an attuned wielder. But with time, perseverance, and personal growth, the Vestige of Divergence can regain access to some of its lost power in its awakened state. Eventually, if its bearer overcomes personal hardship and transforms their own soul, a Vestige of Divergence reaches its full potential in its exalted state. This shows the true power of the item, as it was when first utilized in the "Calamity" against gods armed for war.

The point at which a character finds a Vestige of Divergence, as well as the point at which that item starts to unlock its full power, is entirely in the hands of the Game Master—though it is a topic that players and GMs can discuss and mutually scheme over between game sessions. The acquisition of such an item—or the discovery of its true identity—has the potential to be a scene of momentous narrative weight. Those who bear a Vestige of Divergence are respected and feared by those who understand these items' true power. But such an honor can also paint a target on the bearer's back, for many covet such power, and would do anything to obtain it.

Many of the Vestiges of Divergence detailed in this section can currently be found in Tal'Dorei, while others are scattered elsewhere throughout Exandria. Some of these relics remain lost to time, waiting for someone to find them among the dust and rubble. Others might be in use by powerful heroes ready to pass the item's power onto a worthy successor who fights for the proper cause. Still others might be in the hands of twisted souls using them to terrorize the weak and defenseless. The Vestiges of Divergence are both magic items and narrative devices, and it's the GM's choice as to where any one of them might be found or earned.

#### Advancement of a Vestige of Divergence

The conditions by which a "Vestige of Divergence" progresses to its next level of power can vary, and often revolve around the nature of the specific item and its magic. An attuned bearer of a "Vestige of Divergence" must often symbolically progress to a new state of self-discovery or accomplishment. Alternatively, a "Vestige of Divergence" might bequeath new power to a character in a state of extreme personal duress or desperation.

Such triggering moments are entirely up to the Game Master to identify and unveil, and as such, will likely manifest in unexpected ways. Players should allow the organic narrative moments that they feel might exemplify such an advancement to occur, and GMs should tailor the triggering moment accordingly to be important, impactful, and memorable.

Examples of the kinds of moments that can trigger the advancement of a "Vestige of Divergence" include the following:

- A character finally surmounts one of their greatest fears, bravely overcoming a traumatic event to save a party member.  
- A character is mercilessly defeated by a long-hated foe, and in the face of such defeat, they feel a deep, dormant strength grow from within.  
- A character loses a close ally in battle, and the anguish and fury stirs the power within their "Vestige of Divergence".  
- A character discovers a facet of their destiny that calls their actions toward a dangerous cause—and against their own fear, they accept their fate and responsibility.  
- A character claims vengeance against a rival who has tormented them for ages.  
- A character known for restraint gives in to the amoral violence that the relic they bear was dedicated to.  

If you want to keep the Vestiges "balanced," in addition to being narratively significant, then characters may find a dormant Vestige before 11th level—perhaps unaware that it's even a Vestige! That dormant Vestige is awakened somewhere between 11th and 17th level, and is exalted at any time after that. Even using these level ranges as a rule of thumb, you shouldn't rely too heavily on those mechanical benchmarks. A "Vestige of Divergence's" advancement is triggered by character development, not simply by leveling up.

#### To Suit the Wielder

The "Vestiges of Divergence" were all created by humanoids or gifted by the gods to their humanoid champions. As such, all of these legendary magic items are sized to suit Medium creatures. However, the mighty magic that thrums within each item allows it to grow or shrink in size to suit the creature attuned to it.

The game statistics of a "Vestige of Divergence" don't change when it resizes unless the item is a weapon. When a Large or larger creature makes an attack with such a weapon, the weapon deals one additional damage die for each size category its wielder is larger than Medium. For example, if [Fenthras](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/fenthras-tdcsr.md) is used by a Large fey, attacks made using the longbow deal `2d8` piercing damage. If [Pyremaul](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pyremaul-tdcsr.md) is used by a Huge giant, attacks made using the maul deal `4d6` bludgeoning damage.

Not paltry charms or trinkets, but the kind of magic that suffuses the ley lines of this world and plucks at the very fabric of reality. True, a mortal army may be naught but a cloud of gnats to the gods, but a singular hero—or villain—wielding an artifact imbued with magic beyond reckoning...such a champion could bring their strength and cunning to bear amidst the devastation of the god-war.

## Optional Campaign Rules

Every campaign embarks on its heroic tale in its own way. Simple beginnings for a ragtag lot of sellswords. Students of the world falling in with the wrong crowd. Unwitting pawns of destiny thrust into plots much larger than themselves. However you wish to formulate your story and world—whether as player or GM—the rules of the game can help set a clear vision of how to run a campaign with consistency and intended design.

That being said, sometimes the experienced group wishes to add some new flavor to the existing structure of the gaming world. You can bring in new options for old rules, or adjust to a more advanced level of difficulty in a mystical world where danger—and even death—can be easily circumvented. This section outlines a number of homebrew rules and guidelines that any campaign can adopt to further customize the gaming experience, and which can fit in especially well with a Tal'Dorei campaign.

As with any homebrew or nonstandard rules and options, any of the options presented here that appeal to the players should be approved and implemented by the Game Master. Likewise, Game Masters should "discuss the possible inclusion of any of these options with players beforehand", to ensure that everyone will have fun with the intended changes. Talk these options over and make sure everyone is aware of and fully understands the new rules.

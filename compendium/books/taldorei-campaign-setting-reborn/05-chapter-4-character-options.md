# Chapter 4: Character Options
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, p. 148* 

![A portrait of three mages....](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-splash.webp#center "A portrait of three mages. A bronze dragonborn sorcerer, a masked moon cleric, and a white tiefling blood mage in white-and-red robes.  All three are summoning different forms of magic.")

The sprawling lands and endless challenges of Exandria forge heroes and villains of curious vocations and abilities. The dangers of the chaotic world urge stalwart heroes to defend innocents in need of protection, while uncovered fragments of forgotten powers inspire power-hungry villains to seek new ways to bend reality to their will. The material in this chapter offers a number of new options for characters to define who they are and what they wish to become in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

## Playing in a Tal'Dorei Campaign

This section is for players creating characters for a Tal'Dorei campaign that another player is running as the Game Master. It suggests a number of tips and tricks for how to create a character, and how to make that character's story fit smoothly into the world of Exandria.

### Standard Procedure

Start by creating a character as you normally would for any fifth edition RPG campaign. This process typically involves choosing your character's race, lineage, or ancestry; selecting your class, background, starting equipment, and spells (if applicable); and giving the character a name and backstory. If your Game Master has any house rules or special requests that change this process, they'll let you know.

#### Ancestries

All of the fantasy peoples commonly found in Tal'Dorei, including "humans", "elves", "dwarves", "goblins", "tieflings", and "dragonblood", are described in this chapter. These descriptions don't include game statistics, which can be found in the fifth edition rules, but rather detail the lore of each of these ancestries and how characters of those ancestries fit into the tapestry of Exandrian life.

#### Classes

All the classes in the fifth edition core rules are fair game in Tal'Dorei, and classes and subclasses found in other supplements might be available with your Game Master's permission. This book also contains the following new subclasses, all detailed in this chapter:

- [Barbarian: Path of the Juggernaut](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-juggernaut-tdcsr.md)  
- [Bard: College of Tragedy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard-college-of-tragedy-tdcsr.md)  
- [Cleric: Blood Domain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-blood-domain-tdcsr.md)  
- [Cleric: Moon Domain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-moon-domain-tdcsr.md)  
- [Druid: Circle of the Blighted](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-the-blighted-tdcsr.md)  
- [Monk: Way of the Cobalt Soul](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/monk-way-of-the-cobalt-soul-tdcsr.md)  
- [Paladin: Oath of the Open Sea](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-open-sea-tdcsr.md)  
- [Sorcerer: Runechild sorcerous origin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-runechild-tdcsr.md)  
- [Wizard: Blood Magic arcane tradition](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard-blood-magic-tdcsr.md)  

#### Backgrounds

The backgrounds found in the fifth edition core rules are all well suited to life in Tal'Dorei. This fantasy realm is teeming with [soldiers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/soldier.md), [guild artisans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/guild-artisan.md), [sailors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/sailor.md), and [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/noble.md), all of whom might make interesting adventurers. This book also presents six new backgrounds, detailed later in this chapter:

- [Ashari](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/ashari-tdcsr.md)  
- [Clasp Member](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/clasp-member-tdcsr.md)  
- [Variant Clasp Member (Myriad Operative)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/clasp-member-myriad-operative-variant-tdcsr.md)  
- [Lyceum Scholar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/lyceum-scholar-tdcsr.md)  
- [Reformed Cultist](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/reformed-cultist-tdcsr.md)  
- [Whitestone Rifle Corps](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/whitestone-rifle-corps-tdcsr.md)  
- [Variant Whitestone Rifle Corps (Grey Hunter)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/whitestone-rifle-corps-grey-hunter-variant-tdcsr.md)  

#### Session Zero

The cast of *Critical Role* creates great stories by communicating openly with their Game Master before the campaign begins, and maintaining that communication between game sessions. Doing so ensures that everyone's stories are being told in a fun way, and that everyone is having fun at the table. To get that same experience, be sure to talk with your Game Master about what's important to you while you build your character and flesh out their backstory. That way, your GM will be able to build a story that centers you and your allies as main characters, rather than just bystanders.

Session zero is a catchall term for a pregame meetup between the players (including the GM), where everyone can lay out expectations and boundaries for the campaign. Lots of guides designed to give your campaign a strong start with session zero can be found on the internet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqGzwhnRAk0) and in other fifth edition books. Session zero often includes discussions of the following:

- What each player and the GM like about fifth edition campaigns, and what they're hoping for in this campaign.  
- Likewise, what aspects of play people dislike or are uncomfortable with, or simply want to avoid in this campaign for any reason.  
- If this campaign were a movie, what would its rating be? PG? PG-13? R?  
- Which topics are fun to explore in game, which are absolutely off-limits due to personal discomfort, and which are okay in moderation? Everyone should clearly agree to playing a game that includes topics like extreme violence; romantic or sexual situations; any gender-, race-, disability-, or age-based discrimination or violence; or themes that involve real-life politics or religion.  
- What amount of combat, exploration, and social encounters the players want to experience.  
- What kind of character each player wants to create, and how the characters might fit together into a cohesive party.  
- What type of story everyone wants to experience together, whether that's a meandering episodic tale or a lengthy epic, and whether the story will be driven by player actions and their consequences or by GM-directed plot events.  

Additionally, after each game, many people find it helpful to check in with each other and discuss what everyone enjoyed, wants less of, or wants more of, so the GM and players can prepare to bring more of what worked to the next session, and less of what didn't.

### Flavorful Details

In addition to discussing your character's backstory with your GM and the other players in your group, you can think about other flavorful details to help ground your character in the world of Exandria.

#### Gods

A vast pantheon of deities created Exandria in primeval times. Which of these deities does your character worship, if any? Do they worship an obscure god, or one commonly venerated throughout Tal'Dorei? How devout are they in their faith?

The gods of Exandria are described in more detail in "chapter 2", though your GM might want to keep some of the details of those gods secret.

#### Factions

The politics of Tal'Dorei are influenced by a number of factions. Not all are actively hostile toward each other, and many are actually allies.

But all jockey constantly for power—and frequently come into conflict as a result. Do you belong to one of these factions? Are you a card-carrying member? Do you simply sympathize with their cause, or perhaps have friends or family who are part of the faction? Are there factions you actively despise, perhaps because of some slight they committed against you or those close to you in the past?

Tal'Dorei's factions are described in more detail in "chapter 2", though your GM might want to keep some of the details of those factions secret.

## Races and Cultures

Tal'Dorei is home to manifold humanoid peoples, from the "elves" who emerged from the Fey Realm into the untouched lands of "Gwessar" in the wake of the "Calamity", to the "humans" who first came to Tal'Dorei on stout ships from the distant shores of "Issylra". The familiar fantasy races of "elves", "dwarves", "humans", and "halflings" are the most populous beings on Tal'Dorei, but they are far from the only peoples to make their mark in city and wilderness alike.

Over the past thousand years of history, the peoples described in this chapter have left an indelible mark on the world. And though many of these races appear monolithic at first glance, all are incredibly varied. A first-time visitor to Tal'Dorei might initially perceive all "elves" as haughty and fascinated with heritage, because that's the dominant culture in "Syngorn", the largest elf-majority city on the continent. However, the "elves" living in villages and cities across the land are often exceptions to that apparent rule, and it's dangerous—not to mention rude—for travelers to assume that any of Tal'Dorei's varied peoples fit into simple boxes.

This section is a resource for you to use to inspire your character's backstory—or to inspire your NPCs if you're a Game Master. Whether you enjoy leaning into fantasy archetypes, intentionally breaking them, or ignoring them entirely, this section has something for you. The game statistics of each of the races of Tal'Dorei are identical to those in the fifth edition rules.

### People and Monsters

For generations of roleplaying gamers in many different RPG campaign settings, certain of the fantasy peoples in the world of Exandria have long been considered "monsters" or "evil races." "Goblins", "orcs", and "bugbears" are examples of peoples whose very nature was supposedly tainted by inherent evil, and were thus morally unambiguous targets for adventurers to kill and loot. This mindset treats these people as no different from monsters like [basilisks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/basilisk.md) or [giant spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md).

The humanoid people of Tal'Dorei aren't set up that way. Any creature with the humanoid type is a thinking, feeling person. Creatures with the dragon, giant, or fey type are also unambiguously sapient, and thus can have any alignment. It's just as likely for a human to be a neutral evil [bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) as it is for an orc to be a chaotic good [swashbuckler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/swashbuckler-mpmm.md), or for a [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) to be a lawful good [knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md). And if you like, you can take this even further in your games and say that any fantasy creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher is capable of free thought, and should have just as wide a range of alignments as other sapient beings.

The stories in *Critical Role* are filled with shades of moral gray, but Tal'Dorei still has plenty of unambiguously evil creatures. Most demons, devils, and undead are suffused with cosmic evil, and always try to subvert righteousness. Likewise, unthinking creatures such as oozes and constructs, and creatures of instinctual intelligence such as beasts, many monstrosities, and plant creatures, all make morally unambiguous foes.

Likewise, there are plenty of evil humanoids in the world. Cultists of evil gods, including the "Remnants" who worship The Whispered One, and merciless, blood-soaked bandits such as the "Ravagers" are clear and immediate threats to both the safety of the player characters and all free peoples of Tal'Dorei. Depending on the tone of your story, the characters might cut such foes down without mercy—or they might try to rehabilitate them. The difference is that these villains' choices, not their ancestries, determine whether or not they are evil.

### Cultures across Tal'Dorei

The various peoples of Tal'Dorei don't have racial cultures. Rather, someone's culture is based on the cities and regions in which they spend their formative years. For most of Tal'Dorei's history, members of the different fantasy races lived in largely monolithic enclaves. However, the more recent past has instilled in people the need to break down old barriers, work together, and live together.

All cities and large towns have a majority population of certain races, typically based on the peoples who founded those settlements. This includes such notable sites as the elf-majority city-state of "Syngorn" and the dwarf-majority city-state of "Kraghammer". Some people in Tal'Dorei might assume that certain races have common cultural traits that unite them, but many others know that this isn't the whole truth. A dwarf raised in "Kraghammer" and a dwarf raised in "Stilben" are likely to have very different attitudes about family, food, faith, and all the other factors that make up a culture.

Even when people of the same race gather in neighborhoods within a city, those people don't necessarily share the common culture of their best-known homelands. In many neighborhoods in the great city of "Emon", for example, "elves" and half-elves are a majority. But since not all those elf-kin come from "Syngorn", they don't all share a monolithic "Syngornian" "elf culture."

That said, beings with distinctly magical traits often form cultures that include their unique abilities. This includes folk such as "dragonblood", with their ability to channel elemental power. And because "goliaths" are known for their powerful, muscular bodies, goliath-majority societies often worship the Stormlord, god of strength, and engage in festivals that center around feats of athleticism.

### Dragonblood

The dragonblood of Exandria are a people of unknown origin, and countless myths surround their ancestral creation. One particularly pervasive tale states that dragonblood were created by the Scaled Tyrant and the Platinum Dragon during the "Calamity", serving as loyal soldiers who eventually earned their freedom. Regardless of how they came into being, though, the dragonblood lived for many centuries in relative isolation in the southern wastes of Xhorhas, on the continent of "Wildemount".

Today, dragonblood live all over Exandria, though they remain a scarcer sight in Tal'Dorei than in "Wildemount". Their spread across the world was hastened by the assault against the free peoples of Exandria by the "Chroma Conclave". During that conflict, the ancient white dragon known as Vorugal the Frigid Doom destroyed the magical city-state of Draconia, the ancestral homeland of most dragonblood.

The destruction of Draconia and the loss of many of its people was a tragedy. But to roughly half the dragonblood of Exandria, it also marked the end of an oppressive regime. Dragonblood of Exandria can either be born with a tail or without. In Draconia, those with tails were called draconians or draconbloods, for they were seen as closer in form and power to true dragons. Those without tails were given the name of ravenites and enslaved. Their blood and toil built the mighty towers of Draconia, yet the ravenites enjoyed none of their city's splendor.

The ruin of Draconia thus marked the start of an era of freedom and self-determination for the ravenites. In Tal'Dorei, it's apparent that any differences between the ravenites and the draconians have nothing to do with bloodline or draconic power. Those differences are cultural, and rooted in a past whose conflicts still haven't been resolved. The oppression that existed in Draconia remains largely unknown within Tal'Dorei to this day, and outside of major cities such as "Emon", dragonblood can go for months, even years, without seeing another of their kind.

![A bronze dragonblood holdi...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-dragonblood.webp#center "A bronze dragonblood holding a spear and a glaive, a taller, silver dragonblood stands behind them casting a magical light spell between their hands.")

#### Draconians

The tail-bearing draconians who survived the destruction of Draconia have been scattered across the world. In the time that's passed since the fall of the "dragonblood" city-state, a generation of draconbloods have grown up in Tal'Dorei's towns and cities, disconnected from their parents' privileged upbringing. Only a scant few draconians—typically ones able to teleport away from Vorugal's attack—escaped with any sort of wealth. Most other refugees were lucky simply to escape with their lives.

##### Clinging to the Past

A social divide continues to grow between draconians who have wealth and those who don't. Many of those with wealth greedily cling to the shadows of their former tyrannical glory, but other draconians seek instead to bury the past and create their own destiny, on their own merits.

#### Ravenites

Following the end of the Draconian order, the ravenites ventured into the world eager to make the most of their newfound freedom. In the generation since, many have formed a new homeland in Xhorhas known as Xarzith Kitril, content to reclaim the lands of their birth. Those ravenites who departed "Wildemount" have found a new home in the cities and the icy north of Tal'Dorei, where they enjoy the freedom and privileges of equality that this land provides.

##### Rebuilding from Scratch

Most ravenite children grew up poor, either in slum towns at the edges of cities like "Emon" and "Westruun", or helping their parents laboriously carve out rural lives in the "Dividing Plains" or "Cliffkeep Mountains".

### Dwarves

When the world was nearly rent asunder by the "Calamity", the "dwarves" of Tal'Dorei disappeared underground to wait out the worst of the conflict. Many dwarven citadels once dotted the subterranean world, but over the centuries, they dwindled, either merging together or falling into decadence and ruin. In the centuries following the "Calamity", these dwarf clans, isolated beneath the surface of Exandria, gathered into a single, steadfast redoubt: "Kraghammer". In one way or another, just about every dwarf in Tal'Dorei can trace their family back to that great city-state.

The mountainous stronghold still stands as the heart of settlement in the "Cliffkeep Mountains", and many "dwarves" consider it a place all their folk should visit at least once a decade. "Kraghammer's" legendary status gives it a highly conservative, unchanging culture, but even so, the dwarf people are far from monolithic.

Some "dwarves" like to distinguish themselves as hill or mountain "dwarves", based on whether or not they grew up outside or inside of "Kraghammer". Gurdhe, a Dwarvish word translated into Common as "hill," colloquially means "beyond the mountains" in most Dwarvish dialects. And many "dwarves", even the so-called mountain-dwellers renowned for living their entire lives underground, make journeys out into the "hills" of Tal'Dorei to trade, gain artistic inspiration, or visit the children of long-dead friends they bonded with decades or centuries prior.

![Three dwarves stand togeth...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-dwarves.webp#center "Three dwarves stand together. On the left is a Kraghammer dwarf clad in heavy, bronze armor,  bearing a polearm. On the right is a Hill Traveler with red braids in her hair, leaning on a warhammer. Between them is a Duergar with spiked white hair and bearing a battleaxe.")

#### Kraghammer Dwarves

The culture of "Kraghammer" is one of isolationism and tradition—even to the point of xenophobia. As a common saying goes: "Those who live beneath the mountain are as unmoving as the mountain itself." Whether they're "dwarves", "gnomes", or folk of other ancestries, the people who dwell in "Kraghammer" typically embody this stubborn, dogmatic stoicism.

##### Tradition

"Kraghammer" society is steeped in a culture of "dwarves" protecting their own, and those "dwarves'" traditions of meticulous chronicling, geometrically precise artistry, dynastic great houses, and resilience against even the greatest of threats has proved itself a central pillar of their society. For long centuries, new peoples and new ideas in "Kraghammer" meant potential danger, threatening the death of monarchs and incursion by nefarious subterranean infiltrators. The first time that "Kraghammer" proudly opened its gates to a new people, the oligarch Warren "Drassig" led all of Tal'Dorei into the greatest war since the "Age of Arcanum". The city's relative safety during the assault of the "Chroma Conclave" only cemented its people's belief that isolation is strength.

##### Change

In the present day, many of "Kraghammer's" residents feel stifled by its dominant culture, which continues to be insular and suspicious of outsiders and new ideas. In the past few decades, a tide of refugees fleeing crises such as the "Wittebak disaster" and the "Cinder King's" attack on "Emon" have brought new voices and perspectives to the formerly unyielding halls of "Kraghammer". These people now call the "dwarves'" ancestral realm their home, and many of "Kraghammer's" "dwarves" have seen the innovation and transformation that new residents can bring. Change comes slowly in "Kraghammer", but it does come in time.

#### Hill Travelers

"Dwarves" might leave their underground realm for myriad reasons, with many making homesteads in the foothills of the "Cliffkeep Mountains" or venturing even farther afield. Hill "dwarves" who left the mountain themselves, or who had parents or more distant ancestors who did so, have a certain shared camaraderie in their connection to the open sky above, the sun and wind around them, and the soft loam beneath their feet.

##### Exploration

It's common for "dwarves" who live upon the hills and fields of Tal'Dorei to wander throughout their lives, never putting down roots for more than a decade or two at a time out of their centuries-long lives. "Dwarves" with tanned skin and sun-bleached hair are so common a sight in taverns across the "Dividing Plains" that the Dwarvish word gurdheledr, translated as "hill travelers," has come to mean "mercenary" or "bounty hunter" as commonly as it refers to simple wanderers.

##### Community

"Dwarves" are a common sight in cities such as "Emon" and "Westruun", and even in smaller towns across central Tal'Dorei. Not unlike mountain-dwelling "dwarves", these city dwellers are often as unmoving as a granite boulder on a rock shelf—unable to be budged unless given a tremendous push. "Dwarves" typically adopt the culture of wherever they live, though their long lives sometimes make them more resistant to social change than shorter-lived peoples.

#### Duergar of Emberhold

Deep beneath Tal'Dorei is an underground realm lit only by magelight, magma flows, luminescent creatures and fungi, and the roaring fires of duergar forges. It is thought that a group of "dwarves" delved far into the depths of Exandria countless centuries ago, predating even the chronicles of "Kraghammer". Whether by choice or by necessity, they made a home in the caverns they explored there. Something about the magic that suffuses their eerie realm changed the deep "dwarves"—who are called the duergar now. That name was originally an epithet, bestowed by the mountain "dwarves" who rediscovered and battled those deep "dwarves", but the duergar now wear it with pride.

##### Survival

The deep caverns of Tal'Dorei are an inhospitable place, filled with creatures whose aberrant forms defy imagination and whose alien minds reject mortal morality. The duergar became hardened by their struggle for survival, and their rejection at the hands of the "Kraghammer" "dwarves" hardened their hearts forever. The smiths of the "Emberhold" do not forge art or works of beauty—only weapons and armor to turn back the onslaught of those who wish to see them dead.

##### Alliance

The duergar have suffered alone for so long, hating all and hated by all. Nevertheless, in the undercurrents of the "Emberhold", the idea spreads that there must be more to life than fire and death. Many duergar nurture a secret hope of finding some way to ally with their other dwarf kin—if only someone were brave enough to reach out a hand without fear of it being cut off.

### Elemental Ancestry

Exandria's lands are rife with elemental power. Primordial energy constantly flows into the world from elemental rifts, and such primal power inevitably alters its surroundings. This is also true of peoples who spend long years in proximity to such sources of power, and of those who travel the planes long enough to find the seed of elemental power take root within their blood. Such folk are the beginning of an elemental ancestry, harboring the potential to give birth to children who are suffused with latent magic.

Children of an elemental ancestry bear the features of their parents' ancestry, but have clearly become something new. Their appearance is altered by their power, granting them skin that shines like the sun on the surface of the sea, hair that crackles like flame, or eyes that glitter like gemstones. Then comes the manifestation of elemental powers, which can make a child the envy of their peers—or someone to be feared.

While people of elemental ancestry are rare in Tal'Dorei, they are most common among "the Ashari" due to the elemental affinity of that folk. Some possessed of elemental power enjoy the attention their uniqueness garners them. But for others, even the most benign interest draws painful attention to their otherness.

![An older woman wearing a b...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-elementalancestry.webp#center "An older woman wearing a blacksmith's apron holds a sword she is crafting. She has fiery streaks in her long, white hair. The sword glows orange, heated by her elemental magic.")

#### Belonging

People with an elemental bloodline are often raised by parents in a regular community, and so grow up with all the aspirations and prejudices inherent to their culture. For many such people, the traits that make them unique also make them a pillar of their community—for example, a baker who instinctually understands the will of her oven's fire. Within superstitious lands and cultures, however, a person's elemental powers might make them the target of scrutiny, fearmongering, or jealousy, eventually driving them to strike out into the world to seek a place where they truly belong.

#### Called to the Ashari

Those elemental-touched people who leave their communities often seek out "the Ashari", the isolated keepers of rifts to the Elemental Planes. Elementally attuned children are born with great frequency to "the Ashari", who understand the utmost importance of giving those children the education and training that will let them understand their gifts.

All people of "elemental ancestry" are welcome among "the Ashari", including the Air Ashari and Earth Ashari found in Tal'Dorei. However, even those whose "elemental ancestry" connects them to water or fire can seek out Tal'Dorei's Ashari peoples to help them on their journeys of discovery. In time, such a journey might lead them to the Fire Ashari on the continent of "Issylra", to the Water Ashari on the Islands of Anamn in the Ozmit Sea, or to Ashari who have journeyed from those lands to Tal'Dorei.

Elementally attuned folk who don't seek or can't find "the Ashari" might instead find their way to the reclusive "giants of Tal'Dorei". Though the giants do their best to keep their distance from the lives and problems of humanoids, they have been known to take a shine to people whose shared elemental affinities give them common ground.

### Elves

When the "Calamity" threatened to annihilate all life on Tal'Dorei, the "elves" of this land gathered in their last remaining city, "Syngorn", and used long-forgotten magic to transport themselves into the Fey Realm. Time runs strangely in that realm, and for an unknown stretch of history, the "elves" of "Syngorn" lived with their fey kindred in peace. When they eventually returned to Exandria, they found a land devoid of all but animals and the grandeur of nature. The rotten majesty of the "Age of Arcanum", burned away by the wrath of the gods, had given way to new growth.

To the "elves", the lands of Tal'Dorei are still called "Gwessar", and "elves" who dwell here are called the gwes'alfen—the "elves" of the Fields of Joy. For centuries, this folk watched with delight as other peoples populated "Gwessar", beginning with "dwarves", then "humans" from across the sea, and so on. Then they looked on in horror as mortal ambition was perverted into greed, and war followed in its wake.

"Syngorn" and the "Verdant Expanse" that surrounds it are the ancestral homeland of Tal'Dorei's "elves", many of whom never venture beyond that homeland. Young "elves" are most likely to journey afield to see what else the world has to offer, and while most of them return to "Syngorn", some make new homes in the many towns and cities of Tal'Dorei—or they become hermits, their status as mystical beings with a thousand-year life span commanding an almost mythic reverence from other folk.

The "elves'" tendency to focus on the past has given rise to many stereotypes of those folk being haughty, aloof, and unconcerned with the day-to-day joys and sorrows of the shorter-lived races. But though this is certainly true for some "elves", it's hard for other folk to consider the perspective of an elf who has personally witnessed whole cultures and civilizations rise and fall. Most "elves" are born with the same passion for life as any other being. But as centuries pass, life becomes a stream of historic events to be witnessed and contemplated, and not to be interfered with unless absolutely necessary.

![Three elves stand together...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-elves.webp#center "Three elves stand together. On left is a Lyrengorn elf woman ornately dressed in a beautiful silken ivory gown. On right is a dark elf in rich purple and black robes. She has white hair and casts a spell with a faint, green glow. Between them is a Syngorn elf archer dressed in green robes. He bears a drawn bow and arrow.")

#### Syngorn Elves

The syn'alfen, as the "elves" of the "Verdant Expanse" call themselves, almost universally revere the ancient history of "Syngorn", and the story of how its escape to the Fey Realm saved their culture from extinction. No elf who lives in "Syngorn" can forget this past, and "Syngornian" culture can sometimes feel overbearing to those who see it only from the outside. More than a few woodland "elves" also feel stifled by their homeland's unrelenting focus on history, magic, the fey, and the preservation of elvenkind. Such "elves" are most likely to leave "Syngorn" and make their homes in other parts of Tal'Dorei.

##### Departure

Many "elves" who leave "Syngorn" (or who had parents who left) still consider themselves syn'alfen, whether they live in "Emon" or other cities, or even the ancestral homes of other folk, such as "Kraghammer". The cultural imprint of "Syngorn" is hard to escape, and most of these expatriate wood "elves" hold a certain amount of love for their home even as part of a complicated relationship.

##### Reunited Family

South of the "Stormcrest Mountains" lies the massive jungle of "Rifenmist", home to the nomadic elf "Orroyen tribes". The "Orroyen" believe that they split off from the "Syngorn" "elves" centuries ago, with both peoples meeting each other again only within the past century. Though initially suspicious, both elf lines soon came to see one another as longlost family.

The onslaught of the "Chroma Conclave" disrupted communication with the "Orroyen elves", and news from the south has grown more dire since. "Orroyen" refugees continue to flow into "Syngorn", fleeing the tyrannical "Iron Authority" that rules "Rifenmist".

#### Lyrengorn Elves

The lyren'alfen, known alternately as Lyrengorn "elves" or high "elves", are a people who broke off from "Syngorn" long ago, and who journeyed from southern Tal'Dorei to settle in the frigid "Neverfields", north of the "Cliffkeep Mountains". The city of Lyrengorn that they founded is every bit as majestic as "Syngorn" in the south, but for better or worse, Lyrengorn lacks its sister city's millennia of culture—and its cultural baggage.

##### Art and Expression

Lyrengorn is nestled in the spires of the "Elvenpeaks", spreading under the mysterious northern lights known as the Moonweaver's Ribbons. The city is always aglow with magical light, and its people are taught spellcraft from a young age, for magic is the foundation upon which Lyrengorn was built. The spells of heat and comfort woven into its residents' clothing and architecture are essential to living comfortably in such relentlessly cold lands.

The "elves" who make their home within the pines of the "Elvenpeaks" are best known for riding through the wintry skies on [wyverns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md). Every year, people from across Tal'Dorei travel to the "Elvenpeaks" to watch skyswimmers, elite [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) riders who shape the glow of the Moonweaver's Ribbons from the air.

##### Magic and Transformation

High elf culture values magical prowess above almost all else, but the high "elves" lack the dogma of many of their "Syngornian" cousins. Their society encourages experimentation, both in terms of magic and self-expression. Likewise, lyren'alfen who become adventurers often do so in pursuit of inspiration or self-discovery. High elf societies are filled with elf magi who use magic to transform their bodies, exploring different gender expressions and social roles—and they encourage all who visit Lyrengorn to join them in discovering all the different facets of one's self.

Many high "elves" become religious sorcerers, exploring their latent powers through their faith. Others develop their arcane skill by seeking admission to the "Alabaster Lyceum" in "Emon", where they study the theory of magic with the best minds from across Tal'Dorei.

#### Dark Elves

The myrk'alfen, also known as drow or dark "elves", have a complicated relationship with the other elven societies of Tal'Dorei. Though the "elves" are one people by heritage, the dark "elves" refused to join with the "elves" of "Syngorn" during the "Calamity", instead escaping into the trackless caverns that stretched beneath Tal'Dorei. There, they became the unwitting prey of the Spider Queen, a Betrayer God of immense cruelty.

##### Betrayed by the Gods

In times long past, the drow were a wise, beautiful folk with long, silvery hair and radiant ashen or violet skin. But their underground enclaves grew decadent and cruel, and their leaders fell to the alluring whispers of the Spider Queen. The myrk'alfen allied with their venomous goddess against the Arch Heart and their "elves" in the "Calamity". When the Spider Queen was defeated, the myrk'alfen of Tal'Dorei were exiled permanently from the surface world, confined to their imperious realm within the earth.

##### Struggle to Survive

More evil powers than just the Spider Queen lurk beneath the surface of the world. With the drow in exile, the whispers of the Crawling King and the Chained Oblivion first reached the ears of their nobility as the dark "elves" struggled to stave away the aberrations that encircled their cities. Now, generations later, the dark "elves" are a people seemingly on the brink of annihilation. Neighbors slaughter one another in the streets as they succumb to paranoia. For when aberrations can take or shape any form, who can be trusted? Unable to stop their citizens from rioting, the drow elite have grown ever more authoritarian, commanding their royal guards to keep order by violently suppressing their people.

Against this ongoing chaos, some dark "elves" who fall deep into the abominable thrall of the Spider Queen become truly monstrous, their skin and eyes turning deathly pale as they become little more than puppets for their tormenting goddess. Others willingly offer themselves to the aberrations to end their suffering, and are transformed into shapeshifting [doppelgangers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md). And the most power-hungry drow nobles often succumb entirely to their devotion to the Spider Queen, willingly drinking her abyssal blood to become [driders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/drider.md) in her service.

##### New Light for the Shadow

The people of Tal'Dorei have recently received emissaries from dark "elves" who live in the eastern reaches of "Wildemount", in a nation called the Kryn Dynasty. Their Bright Queen, Leylas Kryn, broke free of the Spider Queen's corrupting influence and led her people to glory and self-determination in the distant lands of Xhorhas. This rebellion was inspired by the discovery of the Luxon, a mysterious being of light and rebirth that the Kryn drow worship as a god.

Though the dark "elves" of the Kryn Dynasty have problems enough of their own, some of the Kryn seek the aid of "Syngorn" and Lyrengorn on expeditions into the depths beneath Tal'Dorei. Their goals are noble, but none can deny that these are missionary expeditions in search of new followers—and in search of new Luxon beacons, the scattered fragments of that new drow god.

Many adventuring drow harbor a violent hatred of aberrations, and have abandoned the Spider Queen's faith to become paladins in service of the Dawnfather or the Luxon, setting aside their affinity for the shadow to search for hope in the light of the sun.

### Firbolgs

Fur-covered folk with floppy ears, flat noses, and long faces, firbolgs are a humanoid people with a unique, somewhat bovine appearance. They aren't insular by nature, but they feel most at ease when surrounded by the natural world, leading the vast majority of firbolgs to never leave their forest homes except under circumstances beyond their control. As a result, many folk in Tal'Dorei don't even know that firbolgs exist. Those firbolgs who do live in the realm's cosmopolitan cities either grow annoyed or accepting of people constantly questioning who—or what—they are.

![A firbolg with long white ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-firbolg.webp#center "A firbolg with long white hair wearing a simple tunic, a multicoloured flower crown, and holding a large bouquet of colourful flowers in their left arm. They are holding a single red rose in their right hand.")

#### Dwellers of Cold Forests

"Firbolgs'" fuzzy bodies are acclimated to cold weather, and they often overheat in warm climes. They are most commonly seen in "Kraghammer", "Zephrah", "Whitestone", and "Stilben", both as residents and as traveling bards and merchants. But they are otherwise a rare sight south of the "Cliffkeep Mountains", though some "firbolgs" enjoy a comfortable life in "Emon" after learning a few handy spells to keep cool in the summer.

The largest and densest population of "firbolgs" in Tal'Dorei is found in the eternally winter-bound forest of the "Frostweald". These "firbolgs" have a friendly but cautious relationship with the capricious fey who also dwell there.

### Gnomes

Gnomes and gnomish culture are relatively uncommon in Tal'Dorei, for although "humans" and rock gnomes both hail from "Issylra", relatively few gnomes have the chance or the desire to leave their homeland. Moreover, their short stature has often proved a social hindrance in the lands of taller folk. But where they have settled, gnomes easily prove their mettle through deed and humor, becoming welcome members of the settlements where they choose to make their homes.

![Two gnomes stand together....](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-gnomes.webp#center "Two gnomes stand together. On right is a forest gnome. He wears a green cloak over a green tunic and has a magical glow emitting from between his hands. On right is a rock gnome. She is a tinkerer dressed in leather apron, bronze pauldron and bearing some clockwork mechanism in her hands.")

#### Rock Gnomes

The first "gnomes" to enter Tal'Dorei migrated from "Issylra" during the "Age of Arcanum", and endured the "Calamity" within the deep caverns of the "Cliffkeep Mountains". These folk called themselves rock "gnomes", and founded a marvelous settlement called "Wittebak". Their society prized cleverness above all other things, eschewing the arts of magic for a focus on tinkering and an understanding of natural phenomena.

##### Dizzying Heights

By the end of the "Calamity", the city of "Wittebak" was the most technologically advanced place in all of Tal'Dorei, even as the "elves" and "dwarves" were emerging from their isolation. However, such greatness could not last. The rock "gnomes" boasted of their superiority to the "ignorant" stone giants who also called the mountains home, and incurred their elemental wrath. In the earthquakes that followed, "Wittebak" and most of its people were destroyed.

##### Eyes Ahead

Most of those who survived the "Wittebak" disaster made their way to "Kraghammer", relying upon the generosity of the "dwarves" to survive. A few others traveled to "Emon" and "Kymal", and helped build those cities in their earliest days. To this day, most "gnomes" with any connection to the heady era of "Wittebak" still call themselves rock "gnomes" in its honor. These "gnomes" carry a certain cultural memory of their city's fall from grace, which drives many of them to strive constantly toward greatness.

##### Eyes Behind

A fair few rock "gnomes" dwelling in "Kraghammer"—elders in particular—take a different view of their people's fall from grace and glory. These "gnomes" work bitterly and tirelessly, fueled by spite and pride, with the intention of either reclaiming "Wittebak" or proving that the city's lost technology is superior to any magic or other force on Exandria.

#### Forest Gnomes

Forest "gnomes" are not native to Tal'Dorei, but unlike rock "gnomes", they are believed to hail from the Fey Realm, much like the "elves". A half dozen small forest gnome communities can be found in the "Verdant Expanse", hidden from the prying eyes of "elves" and human explorers alike. But how "gnomes" ended up in the Fey Realm to begin with is a mystery that even they can't begin to answer.

##### Magic, Not Tech

The biggest difference between the "gnomes" of the forest and their rock gnome cousins are their philosophies toward magic and technology. After spending untold centuries in the Fey Realm, forest "gnomes" have a great respect for magic, especially capricious, unpredictable magic like that of the fey. Forest gnome culture sees technology as predictable and boring, even if its usefulness must be conceded from time to time.

Forest "gnomes" respect the rock "gnomes'" dedication to science, and are more than happy to help their kin in their search to understand how nature works and how to manipulate it. But in the end, knowledge is not as important as canniness in forest gnome enclaves.

##### Worldly Explorers

Not all forest "gnomes" are as close to their fey identity as the "gnomes" of the "Verdant Expanse", and a number of more worldly clans have spread to other forests across Tal'Dorei. Most notably, a number of families, including the Trickfoot clan, have made the "Bramblewood" outside of "Westruun" their home for generations. These clans are more practical than their fey kin and less uptight than their distant rock gnome cousins, giving these "gnomes" a curious personality perfect for the life of a traveling adventurer.

### Goblinkin

"Goblins", "hobgoblins", and "bugbears" are three distinct races with a united past. They live across Tal'Dorei, most often in isolated communities, though many people in the realm have become used to the sight of goblin children playing catch in the street, hobgoblin mercenaries hanging around job boards, and bugbear apothecaries running shops in the hills.

The origin of the goblinkin is shrouded in myth and legend, but it's generally accepted that these peoples were created by the Strife Emperor during the "Calamity" to be his perfect soldiers. The few records of that time hint that the goblinkin were once a single folk called the dranassar, a humanoid people of golden skin and green, violet, or yellow eyes who lived in eastern "Wildemount". They dwelled in great numbers in the city of Ghor Dranas, which came to be the seat of the "Betrayer Gods'" power in the "Calamity".

For centuries, goblinkin were viewed as monsters by most other people of Tal'Dorei—particularly explorers and adventurers who regularly invaded and destroyed goblinkin settlements. But this ugly sentiment has undergone a radical shift in the past generation, during which countless "goblins", "hobgoblins", and "bugbears" have fought alongside the other folk of Tal'Dorei in defense of their homeland against the "Chroma Conclave" and other threats. Today, goblinkin are a welcome sight in Tal'Dorei's cities, and those folk who nurture old hostilities are invariably taken to task by the people around them.

![Three goblinkin. The hobgo...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-goblinkin.webp#center "Three goblinkin. The hobgoblin on the left has black hair pulled back, red skin, and is wearing full armour, has a sword on her back, and a shield on her right forearm. The bugbear in the centre has dark fur, is wearing green cloth holding a scythe in one hand and a bundle of greenery in his other hand. On the right is a smaller goblin with green skin wearing brown and white clothes, wrapping a white bandage around her forearm.")

#### Goblins

"Goblins" are a green-skinned people, short of stature and typically having thin, dexterous fingers and strong, nimble legs. They fit easily into settlements with significant gnome or halfling populations, whose residences and furniture are already appropriately sized. With long traditions of living in isolated family units in forests and mountain caves, many city-dwelling "goblins" dwell in large houses holding at least three generations of family and many different branches of their family tree.

#### Hobgoblins

Most "hobgoblins" are alike in stature to "humans" and have similar variations in build, ranging from thin and scrawny to broad shouldered and muscular. Their large ears, gleaming yellow eyes, and powerful incisors give them a vaguely feline appearance.

"Hobgoblins" are often stereotyped as having a warlike, martial nature—a sentiment that arose from rumors surrounding the "Iron Authority" in the "Rifenmist Jungle". That empire is majority [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), and its cruel leaders have press-ganged the land's entire population into compulsory military service. In ages past, most "hobgoblins" that became known to the other peoples of Tal'Dorei were scouts or captured legionnaires of the "Iron Authority". Today, though, many escapees from the authority's influence live in cities such as "Emon", "Kymal", or "Byroden". Most of these free "hobgoblins" know only their parents' stories of that distant empire, and are able to live happily free of its influence.

#### Bugbears

"Bugbears" are tall humanoids covered with brown, black, or blue-gray fur, which combines with large ears and yellow eyes to give them an even more feline appearance than their [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) cousins. Though "bugbears" are tall, their posture is generally stooped, so that their heads are still roughly at human height.

Many "bugbears" are solitary folk, living in forests and mountains where their thick fur protects them against the cold. They typically gather in large groups one to three times a year to socialize and play games with friends, reunite with family, and find love—a tradition that has been reworked by those who live in permanent communities. Such "bugbears" often live with a number of romantic partners under the same roof, or "adopt" [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) families and dwell in their loving, chaotic, multigenerational households.

### Half-Giants

Four peoples were known to exist on Tal'Dorei when the world was reborn out of the ashes of the "Calamity". The "elves", who emerged from the Fey Realm. The "dwarves", who emerged from the earth. The "orcs", who endured the "Calamity" through strength and determination. And the half-giants, who safely rode out that war in mountaintop retreats before eventually descending to the windswept plains below.

Averaging seven feet tall, with hairless, craggy bodies and skin tough as stone, half-giants are often colloquially known as stoneborn or "goliaths". Descended from [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md), these folk have long been viewed as exemplars of rugged endurance and individualism. They are found in settlements across Tal'Dorei, where they are known for their innate strength and their commonly held belief—passed down from the giants of old—that all must take fate into their own hands.

In ancient times, "goliaths" and "orcs" lived off the same land, and their nomadic clans frequently warred and intermingled in equal measure. As such, it is common for "orcs" and "goliaths" of Tal'Dorei to discover common ancestors somewhere in their family trees.

![A pale-skinned half-giant ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-halfgiants.webp#center "A pale-skinned half-giant sits on a chair backwards, leaning on the chairback. She is a bit too large for the chair. She wears a yellow tunic, green pants and has black tattoos down her arms and on her head.")

#### Nomadic Herds

Stone giants believe that physical perfection is the world's greatest virtue, and this belief has been passed down culturally to the "goliaths" who live in the mountains and upon the "Dividing Plains". These plains-dwelling "half-giants" call their clans "herds," and unite behind the stone giants' philosophy of "might makes right." Though at one time these herds were mostly made up of stoneborn almost exclusively, recent generations have come to include "humans", "orcs", "dwarves", and even physically diminutive people such as "halflings"—as long as they agree with the philosophy of strength above all.

##### Rivermaw

The greatest of the half-giant herds is the "Rivermaw", whose members use their strength of arms and political cunning to protect their ancestral lands from incursion. The "Rivermaw herd" includes many "goliaths" from the now-broken Herd of Storms, whose folk suffered at the hands of the tyrant Kevdak many years ago, and who now seek to protect others from ever suffering as they did.

##### Ravagers

Opposing the "Rivermaw" are the Ravagers—a group that the "Rivermaw" have stripped of the title of "herd" in disgust. The Ravagers are more a death cult dedicated to the Betrayer God called the Ruiner than a true clan. Just like the contemporary Rivermaw, the ranks of the Ravagers are filled with people of many different ancestries, from "goliaths" to "humans" to bloody-minded "firbolgs"—all of them rejecting order to embrace slaughter and cruelty.

#### Towers of Stone

Tal'Dorei's most famous goliath, the legendary hero [Grog Strongjaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grog-strongjaw-tdcsr.md), is renowned for being a warrior first and a thinker second. But "goliaths" are no less intelligent or canny than Tal'Dorei's other peoples. Despite being known as nomadic folk, many "half-giants" understand that stone is sturdiest when formed into towers, walls, and bridges, and cities such as "Kraghammer" and "Emon" have long been filled with the works of goliath masons and architects not given the historical recognition they deserved.

Great advances in mathematics and civil engineering have been made by other city-dwelling stoneborn, and scholars of the "Cobalt Soul" are working to confirm which of the beloved "Emonian" and "Westruunian" structures that survived the "Chroma Conclave" are actually the result of pioneering goliath minds. "Westruun" has long been home to vast numbers of "half-giants" dwelling there to be close to their former herds, but many others have set down more recent roots after the Battle of "Westruun", helping rebuild in the wake of the destruction wrought by the dragon Umbrasyl and the Herd of Storms.

### Halflings

No one really knows how halflings appeared on Exandria, nor is it known how they first arrived in Tal'Dorei. Some halfling scholars are eager to trace the origin of their people, but many of those who live out in the countryside are more keen on inventing increasingly tall tales regarding the roots of their ancestry. One popular creation myth is that when the All-Hammer made the "dwarves", a little bit of leftover clay slipped from his hands and landed on the rolling fields beyond the "dwarves'" mountains, where it became the first halflings. Though most people dismiss this story as nothing more than folklore, a sense of the halflings having humble beginnings fits with the place they've found for themselves in Tal'Dorei.

The historical records of the "Cobalt Soul" assert that halflings journeyed across the Ozmit Sea from "Issylra" with Tal'Dorei's first "humans", with both peoples coexisting in peaceful harmony in this realm's earliest cities and idyllic agrarian towns. "Humans" and halflings likewise fought together—and against each other—when the Iron Rule of "Drassig" swept across the land.

The "Scattered War" divided halflings across the continent in two ways. Thousands of "humans" and halflings were impressed by "Drassig's" strength and joined his armies, even as many of those who refused to join turned away from their old allegiances. One group of halflings decided that "humans" had betrayed them and that Warren "Drassig" was emblematic of all humanity's evils, and formed the Stoutheart Clan in response. They stockpiled weapons and began a campaign of guerilla warfare against "Drassig's" armies—even battalions that held former friends and family among their ranks.

Another clan, the Lightfoots, asserted that all "humans" couldn't be condemned for the evil actions of one king, and pointed to the thousands of halflings and other non-humans who had allied themselves with "Drassig's" evil regime as proof. The Lightfoots advocated protecting as many people as possible while waiting the war out. In the end, it became clear to both halfling clans that in a conflict against a tyrant such as "Drassig", neutrality was not an option. They banded together behind "Zan Tal'Dorei's" banner of rebellion.

These two clans dissolved after the "Scattered War", but many contemporary halfling families can trace their genealogies back to one or the other, and proudly proclaim that their great-grandparents were there when history was being made. Most halflings treat this sense of history only as idle fun, though, and few feel any real animosity over old ills and grudges.

![Two halflings stand togeth...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-halflings.webp#center "Two halflings stand together. Both are barefoot. On left is a Stoutheart halfling bearing a sword in one hand and a music sheet in the other. On right is a Lightfoot halfling bard, dressed in a green tunic and bearing a violin and bow.")

#### Lightfoot Clan

The Lightfoot Clan dissolved into its many component families after the war, but the spirit that created the clan still survives. Those "halflings" who strongly identify with their Lightfoot identity look out for number one first, and are more likely to try to evade conflict than to meet an oncoming storm head-on. Yet a contradiction lingers within the Lightfoot spirit, for despite all their love of the comforts of home, many Lightfoot "halflings" feel a certain unquenchable hunger to explore. Many adventuring "halflings" are Lightfoots who have given in to this compulsion.

#### Stoutheart Clan

The Stoutheart Clan also dissolved in the wake of the "Scattered War", but its ideals and identity still endure. Brashness and courage even in the face of absurd odds embodies the Stoutheart spirit. Recalling the guerilla army that stood against the legions of "Drassig", any halfling with the fortitude to stand up to a warrior three times their size has more than earned the honor of calling themself a Stoutheart—even if their family tree doesn't have true roots in that historic clan.

Stouthearts often surprise other people who know of "halflings" only from experiences with more laidback Lightfoot folk—and many use this surprise to their advantage to become truly cunning diplomats. The proud Stoutheart named Assum Emring, a former member of the "Tal'Dorei Council", once boisterously claimed that he was so rude, so brash and so defiant in his first meeting with the late Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, that he was very nearly arrested—before being offered a position on the sovereign's staff the very next day!

### Humans

Humans are the most populous race in Tal'Dorei today, though at one point in this land's history, all of humankind's holdings were naught but a speck on the western coastline.

If "humans" ever lived upon Tal'Dorei in the "Age of Arcanum", they were wiped out entirely by the end of the "Calamity". But after the world had begun to recover from the devastation wrought by that war of gods and mortals, an expedition of human explorers departed from Vasselheim in "Issylra", thought to be the only bastion of humanoid culture on the surface of Exandria to survive the "Calamity". Sailing eastward, they reached the land that would eventually come to be called Tal'Dorei, and were shocked to find "elves", "dwarves", "orcs", and "half-giants" already living there—shattering their belief that the "Calamity" had washed away all mortal life except the people of Vasselheim.

Over the years, "humans" and their ambition have been responsible for bloody wars, weapons of unimaginable devastation, and spells that have reduced entire cultures to ruin. Yet "humans" have also driven great advances in art, music, poetry, and theater, and have shown love and compassion to the other mortal peoples of the world. The course of human history is never straight, and can turn at any time. After all, "humans'" lives are short and their minds are chaotic—a fact that troubles many of the long-lived "elves" and "dwarves" of Tal'Dorei. Still, despite these weaknesses—or perhaps because of them—"humans" have produced some of the most innovative and forward-thinking figures Tal'Dorei has ever known.

![Two humans stand together,...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-humans.webp#center "Two humans stand together, poised to fight. On left is an older white woman with long grey hair. She holds a silver sword with a golden hilt, and wears full chain and plate armor. The other human is a brown man wearing a purple and blue tunic atop light armor, he is holding a wooden staff.")

#### A Far-Reaching People

"Humans" can hail from anywhere in Tal'Dorei, for although their presence on the continent began as a small colony in the west, that presence quickly spread. "Humans" were eager to trade, to forge alliances, and to find love with the "elves", "dwarves", "orcs", and "goliaths" of Tal'Dorei. Their lands quickly grew in size and power. But then a human despot by the name of Warren "Drassig" broke the peace of trade and coalition in favor of conquest.

"Drassig's" betrayal nearly condemned humankind to an eternal reputation for villainy. However, one human rebel named "Zan Tal'Dorei" forged alliances of renewed trust between her rebellious faction and the other beleaguered peoples of "Drassig's" kingdom. Her forthright idealism and steadfast determination won the "Scattered War", and laid the foundations for a new society that enshrined the alliances she created.

Though human adventurers can hail from anywhere in Tal'Dorei, "humans" are most commonly found in the lands connected by the "Silvercut Roadway": the "Bladeshimmer Shoreline" in the west, the "Lucidian Coast" in the east, and the "Dividing Plains" that separate them. A number of "humans" from "Wildemount" also sailed across the "Shearing Channel" long ago and settled in the "Alabaster Sierras", where they founded the city-state of "Whitestone".

"Humans" living along the "Silvercut" provide the infrastructure for trade across the continent, and as such are often involved in some form of craft, business, or production. Human-dominated cities in Tal'Dorei are typically highly diverse, because they were founded with the aid of many allies of other ancestries. Today, members of all Exandria's other peoples come together in great cities such as "Emon", even as "humans" from the distant continents of "Issylra", "Marquet", and "Wildemount" travel to exchange goods and ideas with the vast and bountiful lands of Tal'Dorei. Beyond the cities, dozens of humanfounded outposts spread along the fringes of lands better known by Tal'Dorei's older ancestries—the "elves", "dwarves", "orcs", "goliaths", and even the reclusive "giants". Outlanders, explorers, and hermits take refuge here from the hectic pace of city life, but still find danger enough in the wilderness to keep them on their toes.

Many "humans" likewise live in settlements founded by non-humans, ranging in size from tiny gnome-majority villages in "Torian Forest" to the ancient and stately cities of "Syngorn" and "Kraghammer". These "humans" absorb the cultures of their homes, just as people of other ancestries raised in cities such as "Emon" can grow up with a distinctly human outlook on life.

### Orcs

Orcs survived on Tal'Dorei during the "Calamity" through sheer determination and strength. Unlike the "elves" and "dwarves" who hid in their secret retreats, and the "goliaths" who watched the destruction from their mountaintops, great clans of orcs fought endless bloody battles on the "Dividing Plains" as the gods and their loyal minions clashed, wielding magic sufficient to rip the world asunder. And the orcs endured—perhaps in part because of the divine power behind that people's creation.

The myth surrounding the orcs' origin is a grim one. It is said that they were created by accident when the Arch Heart, god of the "elves", shot out the eye of the war god known as the Ruiner. The Ruiner's blood poured from his wound and rained upon the armies of "elves" who served the Arch Heart—and those unsuspecting mortals were transformed. Their muscles bulged, tusks grew from their jaws, and their minds burned with a thirst for blood.

Yet after that battle's end, the fury within these new humanoids burned away, and the orcs survived as a hardy, physically powerful people. In the early days of "Gwessar", orc clans warred with anyone who invaded their territory, especially the "goliaths" who descended from the mountains to the plains, and who rivaled the orcs in both strength and stature. But once more, fury cooled in time, and reasonable voices won out over those of even the most passionate warmongers.

Today, orcs and other folk with orcish heritage can be found all across Tal'Dorei. Many orcs find their natural athleticism an asset in specific trades, but they can be found in every guild and profession. Though orcs and "humans" have an ancient legacy of conflict that lives on in a prejudiced few, the realm is filled with people who denounce and ostracize any who discriminate against their orc neighbors.

![A green orc with short bla...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-orcs.webp#center "A green orc with short black hair wearing a faded tunic and blue pants, holding a shepherd's crook in their left hand and a white sheep under their right arm.")

#### From Near and Far

Though many of Tal'Dorei's "orcs" are related to clans that have lived nomadically on the continent since time immemorial, the major cities of the land are also home to "orcs" who've traveled to Tal'Dorei from across the sea. Many of those "orcs" originated in the lands of Xhorhas, in "Wildemount", and the continent of "Marquet"—places where "orcs" have never been denied the opportunity to become great scholars or leaders.

### Tieflings

Though Tal'Dorei was once awash with fell legends claiming to detail the evil origin of "tieflings", the more progressive parts of the realm have long since stomped out such ugly myths. Still, many folk can't help but show surprise the first time they see a person with horns curling from their brow, gleaming eyes of a single solid color, and lustrous, brightly hued skin of red, purple, or blue.

Scholars have scoured thousands of years of "Issylran" history in search of the origin of "tieflings", to little avail. The most complete extant records suggest that during the "Age of Arcanum", a cabal of power-hungry "Issylran" warlocks consorted with extraplanar entities, and that many of these unions resulted in children who shared the qualities of human and fiend. These progeny of the Lower Planes eventually came to break away from that origin to become a people unto themselves.

The first "tieflings" to walk on Tal'Dorei sailed from "Issylra" during the "Age of Arcanum", fleeing religious zealots who believed their very existence was an abomination. Many "tieflings" in Tal'Dorei refused to fight during the "Calamity", embracing a nihilism which said that if the world could reject their kind, perhaps it was better to just let it burn. Yet the world and the "tieflings" survived.

In the centuries after the "Divergence", "tieflings" who had grown weary of gods and demons rejoiced, feeling that the gods' imprisonment had effectively freed them from their cursed past. As such, when Warren "Drassig" and his sons conquered the elven lands of "Gwessar", countless "tieflings" rose in rebellion against the tyrant. They had seen his kind before, they knew his methods, and they knew others would suffer as they once had.

![A light blue-skinned tiefl...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter4-tieflings.webp#center "A light blue-skinned tiefling with two tall horns and dark blue long hair.

"Tieflings" who form a union always have tiefling children, and most "tieflings" belong firmly to that ancient ancestry. Yet to this day, any humanoid—whether famous hero or common farmer—who makes a deal with fiends might give rise to children, grandchildren, or even more distant descendants born with the horns, eyes, and colorful skin of a tiefling.

Perhaps the most famous tiefling born in the past generation is Gwendolyn de Rolo, the youngest daughter of the renowned heroes [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) and [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) de Rolo of "Whitestone". It is an open secret in the city-state that [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) had dealings with fiends as a young man. Yet though none of the rumors have precisely pinpointed the nature of [Percival's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) supernatural bargain, all who know Gwendolyn agree that she is the sweetest and most innocent de Rolo to roam the halls of "Castle Whitestone" in many years.

### Mixed Ancestry

Even the oldest records of the "Cobalt Soul" are unclear as to whether the ancestries of "elves", "dwarves", "orcs", and "goliaths" routinely mixed before the arrival of humankind on Tal'Dorei's shores. But it's easy to assume that explorers and ambassadors would inevitably find love or companionship among the folk of unfamiliar lands—and it is well known that the arrival of "humans" changed Tal'Dorei forever.

From the earliest days of human exploration on the continent, love and passion began to blossom between all of Tal'Dorei's people. The children that spring from the unions of folk of different heritage bear the traits of each of their parents, so that a human child might gain patches of scales and reptilian eyes from a "dragonblood" parent, or an orc and a dwarf might raise a child of squat, stout stature and olive-green skin, and bearing wisps of a coppery beard even as an infant.

In the modern age, love unites all folk. People of mixed ancestry can be found all across Tal'Dorei, though they are most common in the realm's cosmopolitan cities. Some ancestries are biologically improbable (such as a goliath and a gnome having a child), but sufficient application of magic makes even those unions possible. However, money can be a limiting factor in such things, as having a skilled mage on hand during conception and childbirth is an expensive process.

Non-humanoid creatures with the magical ability to assume humanoid size and form, such as dragons, can also sire or give birth to mixed-ancestry children.

### Other Races

In addition to humanoids, countless other sapient beings walk the lands of Tal'Dorei. Many of these are rare creatures, never building communities of folk who share their appearance and abilities. Some are wholly unique creations of unpredictable magical effects. Others are mighty beings such as dragons and giants, who can take on the role of hero or villain with equal ease but who intentionally separate themselves from the affairs of Tal'Dorei's other mortal peoples.

## Subclasses

This section features new subclass options for some of the familiar fifth edition character classes. These subclasses grant you new options not available to all members of your class. Information on your full class features, as well as other subclasses, can be found in the fifth edition rules.

### Barbarian

You are a wild warrior whose emotions and instincts guide you in combat far more than logic or tactics. When your barbarian character chooses a primal path at 3rd level, the [Path of the Juggernaut](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-juggernaut-tdcsr.md) is a new option for use in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> [!note] Kel'jaia Uloeh
> 
> *Female gnome Path of the Juggernaut barbarian*
> 
> When Kel'jaia sets her eyes on something, nothing can stop her from achieving it. Her small size has no bearing on her unbelievable strength, which can overpower creatures many times her size. She came to Tal'Dorei after the village on the "Rifenmist Peninsula" she was defending was razed by the "Iron Authority". She first arrived in "Syngorn", and through the connections and friendships she made there, was chosen to be a "Syngornian" delegate to the "Tal'Dorei Council". She strongly believes that Tal'Dorei should take a stand against the cruelty of the Authority. Should strife come to Tal'Dorei, Kel'jaia is thought by all to be the council's first choice for the Master of War, due to her valor, tactical cunning, and battle prowess.

> [!note] Rules Tip: Forced Movement
> 
> Usually when one creature moves out of a hostile creature's reach, the hostile creature can use its reaction to make an [opportunity attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack). However, forced movement—such as being pushed by a Path of the Juggernaut barbarian's [Thunderous Blows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-juggernaut-tdcsr.md#Thunderous%20Blows%20(Level%203)) feature—doesn't provoke [opportunity attacks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack).
> 
> Likewise, a juggernaut barbarian's [Hurricane Strike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-juggernaut-tdcsr.md#Hurricane%20Strike%20(Level%2010)) feature allows an ally to make a melee weapon attack as a reaction only if the foe ends its forced movement within 5 feet of the ally. If a foe is pushed through other spaces within 5 feet of your allies, those allies can't make normal [opportunity attacks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack) against the foe.

### Bard

You are a charming performer whose wit and words can inspire heroism in your allies and a rising sense of dread in your foes. When your bard character chooses a bard college at 3rd level, the [College of Tragedy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard-college-of-tragedy-tdcsr.md) is a new option available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> [!note] Balthasar Bleakskull
> 
> *Male half-giant College of Tragedy bard*
> 
> Born in "Westruun" and raised by two loving goliath parents—a towering warrior and an equally massive astronomer of the "Yuminor Observatory"—Balthasar Bleakskull was exposed to the adventuring lifestyle and academia from an early age. He tumbled into the art of theater when he was but a child, and followed his passion for drama into adulthood—when he was entangled in a bloodcurdling academic conspiracy that left eight dead, including his dramatic mentor and his lover. Since then, he has devoted his dramatic skill to the art of tragedy, to grant his audiences the catharsis that he one day hopes to give himself.

### Cleric

You are a wise disciple of one or more of Exandria's gods, whose divine hands can no longer shape the world on their own. When your cleric character chooses a divine domain at 1st level, you can consult your god's entry in chapter 2 for suggestions on which domains they might grant. The [Blood Domain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-blood-domain-tdcsr.md) and [Moon Domain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-moon-domain-tdcsr.md) are new options available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> [!note] Alasterre de Vitrevos
> 
> *Male human Blood Domain cleric*
> 
> The director of Tal'Dorei's "Claret Order" is a meticulous, orderly man. He believes that he deserves all the good that comes to him in the world—and, in fairness, all the bad as well. He wields the unsettling magic of [hemocraft](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hemocraft-tdcsr.md) created by his order in service of both his organization's interests, and the divine interests of the Matron of Ravens. His goals are simple: purge the world of undead, particularly [vampires](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire.md), and make his name one sung across Exandria in the process.

Nalys Ildareth, leader of an obscure "Syngornian" sect of the Moonweaver, believes that true reverence requires all faithful to have a face they show to the world—represented by a mask of silver they never remove—and one they keep to themselves, beneath the mask. Nalys believes that it is their duty to enact the Moonweaver's will upon Exandria, and keep the world safe within the balance of Catha's calm order and the ill-fated chaos of Ruidus. They are thoughtful and calculating, seeming an impassive observer while they wait for the proper moment to strike, but then transforming into a furious avenger when that moment arrives.

### Druid

As a druid, you are a keeper of the old ways, attuned to nature and channeling power that grants you spells and allows you to transform your body. When your druid character chooses a druid circle at 2nd level, the [Circle of the Blighted](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-the-blighted-tdcsr.md) is a new option available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> [!note] Camellia Springshower
> 
> *Female firbolg Circle of the Blighted druid*
> 
> Life was beautiful under the light of the sun for Camellia Springshower. The sun caused her flowers to flourish, and the rains nourished them so they could grow when next the sun arose. One day, however, she wandered too far from her family while they traveled the "Dividing Plains", and tumbled into the bleak depths of "Shadebarrow", a forgotten, accursed tomb. She ran for the light, but a specter reached out from the walls and touched a ghastly finger to her chest. She felt her blood run cold, and the flowers within her basket wither away. Though she escaped the "Shadebarrow", she was never able to find her family again, and she now wanders the "Dividing Plains" like an untethered shadow—hoping to use the blighted powers granted to her by the shade to do some semblance of good in the world, even if all life seems to wither beneath her touch.

### Monk

You are a canny martial artist whose connection to the unseen energy of life grants you supernatural insights and the ability to manipulate your foes. When your monk character chooses a monastic tradition at 3rd level, the [Way of the Cobalt Soul](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/monk-way-of-the-cobalt-soul-tdcsr.md) is a new option available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> [!note] Cressida Holt
> 
> *Nonbinary (she/they) orc Way of the Cobalt Soul monk*
> 
> A freshly titled expositor of the "Cobalt Soul", Cressida Holt has already made a name for themself as a suave, stylish secret agent. Their assignments as an expositor take them across Tal'Dorei, though they are most often seen in "Emon", "Kymal", and "Westruun", where they infiltrate political galas, high-stakes games of two-card, and other dens of high-society corruption.
> 
> Though most "Cobalt Soul" expositors are expected to keep a low profile and gather intelligence, Cressida has found success with a flashier method. She strides into a room in a fine cobalt-blue suit, makes sensual eye contact with the most beautiful person in the room, and casually makes herself someone from whom no one can keep a secret.

### Paladin

You are an honorable warrior whose devotion to a cause or ideal empowers you with righteous magic. When your paladin character chooses a sacred oath at 3rd level, the [Oath of the Open Sea](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-open-sea-tdcsr.md) is a new option available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> [!note] Shirkuh Marín
> 
> *Male human Oath of the Open Sea paladin*
> 
> Though he is only in his early 30s, famed sailor Shirkuh Marín is well on the way to having his life become an epic sung in taverns all over the Lucidean Ocean. Born a girl to Marquesian immigrant parents in Nicodranas on "Wildemount's" Menagerie Coast, Shirkuh took his present name from his great-granduncle, an infamous Marquesian pirate. He swore to wear that name with pride, and has followed his own code of honor and ethics ever since. He has worked hand-in-hand with both honest sailors and pirates of the Revelry—and clashed swords with both, too.
> 
> Of the many tales that surround Shirkuh, it's unclear which are true—if he truly outran a [juvenile kraken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/juvenile-kraken-gos.md) in the "Shearing Channel", if he indeed cheated the Plank King in a game of two-card and lived to tell the tale, and if he actually managed to steal the heart of a "Clasp" Spireling in "Kymal". But most agree that even if the stories are made up, he possesses both the talent and the recklessness to have accomplished them if he set his mind to it.

Paladins of the [Oath of the Open Sea](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-open-sea-tdcsr.md) automatically gain two new spells through their [Oath Spells feature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-open-sea-tdcsr.md#Oath%20Spells%20(Level%203)). These spells can also be learned by druids, rangers, and sorcerers of the appropriate level, at the GM's discretion.

When you heavily obscure an area using your [Marine Layer Channel Divinity](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-open-sea-tdcsr.md#Channel%20Divinity%20(Level%203)) option, all creatures within the area have their vision completely blocked, and creatures outside the area can't see in. Creatures that can't see automatically fail ability checks that require sight. Also, attack rolls against creatures that can't see have advantage, and their own attack rolls have disadvantage.
>

### Sorcerer

You are a spellcaster to whom magic comes as naturally as breathing, possessing an instinctive grasp of its power—for that power flows through your very veins. When your sorcerer character chooses a sorcerous origin at 1st level, the [Runechild origin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-runechild-tdcsr.md) is a new option available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

> When you're a model in a city as big as "Emon", you've got to find a way to stand out. Being a broad-shouldered, heavyset "dragonblood" with brass scales that twinkle in the sun is a good start, but Karzy Sunscale has another ace up his sleeve: he's a runechild. Ever since he was an infant, he has manifested strange magical abilities, and when he expresses intense emotions through his magic, mysterious runes flare to life upon his scales. All of these traits have always made Karzy the center of attention, and he basks in other peoples' interest like a lizard in the sun. He goes out of his way to dress in outrageous fashions and emote as vividly as he can. He works as a fashion model in "Emon", but the idea has worked its way into his head that he could make an even bigger splash if he were to also become a celebrity adventurer by completing a truly monumental quest.

You are a studious spellcaster who has earned your influence over arcane power through long hours of rigorous learning. When your wizard character chooses an arcane tradition at 2nd level, [Blood Magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard-blood-magic-tdcsr.md) is a new option available in a Tal'Dorei campaign.

She was raised by dwarf parents from the "Alabaster Sierras", and wears wizardly robes in the style of their clan in honor of them.

## Backgrounds

Every player character in a fifth edition fantasy roleplaying game has a background. While your class represents your role in an adventuring party, your background represents who you were and what you learned before you began your adventuring career. Your background doesn't necessarily have to be confined to the past, though, as the way it marks your connections to the world might involve ongoing commitments to an organization or even an entire people.

The new backgrounds in this section each grant your character new proficiencies, languages, and equipment, as well as a unique background feature. Tables of characteristics can also help you quickly generate personality traits, ideals, character flaws, and bonds to tie your character to the people, places, and causes of a Tal'Dorei campaign.

## Supernatural Blessing: Fate-Touched

Most lives and souls find their ways easily along the paths of fate and destiny, oblivious and eager to be a part of the history meant for them. Some souls, however, carry themselves with mysterious influence, the golden threads of their fate subtly guiding history as they pass. Events both magnificent and catastrophic often follow such souls, which take the form of great rulers and terrible tyrants, powerful mages, religious leaders, and legendary heroes. These are the fate-touched.

Few fate-touched ever become aware of their prominent nature. Without the confirmation of the gods themselves, few can know for certain that they bear this blessing. And this is as it should be, for people of renown and power grow easily jealous of those whose gifts outstrip their own. The surviving chronicles of the "Age of Arcanum" are filled with tales of magical hierarchs who enslaved those they took for fate-touched—or worse, attempted to extract the essence of fate from them by the most horrid means. Being touched by fate can be a blessing or a curse. It is most often those who bear the blessings of fortune who are remembered by history, while those cursed by fate are forgotten. Most cultures of Exandria have legends of those marked by ill fate simply by being born under the full light of Ruidus, the vermilion moon around which countless fell legends swirl.

Player characters and NPCs gain this blessing by having the GM grant it to them, gaining the [Fortune's Grace](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/fortunes-grace-tdcsr.md) feature as a result. A character might receive the blessing as a gift from the gods, or as a temporary and surprising phenomenon when the campaign shifts into a story arc focused on that character. An NPC ally might bear this blessing to help them survive as the characters protect them from a terrible threat. A previously benign NPC might even become a power-hungry villain as they test the limits of their fate-touched gift.

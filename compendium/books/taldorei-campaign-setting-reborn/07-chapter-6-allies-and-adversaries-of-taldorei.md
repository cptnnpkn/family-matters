# Chapter 6: Allies and Adversaries of Tal'Dorei
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, p. 217* 

![Six members of Vox Machina...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter6-splash.webp#center "Six members of Vox Machina face off against Raishan, an ancient green dragon. Left to right, Percy aims his pepperbox pistol, Pike rushes into battle with mace drawn, Keyleth prepares a spell, Grog lunges at the maw - greataxe drawn. Vax preps three daggers and Vex draws back on her bow.")

The lands of Tal'Dorei are filled with people and monsters prepared to ambush adventurers, barter with entrepreneurial explorers, and forge alliances with charismatic characters—or at least with those willing to pay.

The first part of this chapter is a discussion of just some of the many types of creatures a GM might use as NPCs in a Tal'Dorei campaign (including creatures of the races presented in "chapter 4"). The second part of the chapter is a bestiary with game statistics for new NPCs and monsters unique to Tal'Dorei and other parts of Exandria.

## Nonplayer Creatures

Tal'Dorei is filled with non-humanoid beings that leave their mark on the world even if they typically don't go on adventures in dungeons or journey across the world on epic quests. The types of creatures in this section are those who the player characters can encounter on their adventures as either friends or foes. Many of these creatures are fully described in the fifth edition rules. The lore here simply covers how they function in the world of Exandria.

The creatures in this section include many not meant to be used as player characters in a typical campaign, including those with non-humanoid physiology (such as "centaurs"), large size (including "giants"), or alien minds ("aboleths" and the like). But many other creatures of Exandria are suitable for player character use even if they don't have statistics in the fifth edition core rules. Creatures such as minotaurs, "gnolls", and the many humanoids with animal-like traits ranging from eagles to [elephants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/loxodon-ggr.md) can be used as player characters if players and Game Masters are willing to put in the effort to make them work in a campaign. The same is technically true for creatures like dragons, fey, and giants, but their size and innate powers can make it difficult for them to be members of a balanced adventuring party.

### Aboleths

Vile, intelligent, and imbued with corrupting psychic abilities, [aboleths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) are three-eyed piscine beings that lurk in watery grottos deep beneath the surface of Exandria. These aberrations are irredeemably evil, and all who attempt diplomacy with an [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) end up as their food—or worse, their mindless thralls. Most [aboleths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) grandiloquently claim that they have no notion of morality, but only an inexorable sense of purpose that is utterly inscrutable to the lesser minds of humanoid creatures. But even such "lesser minds" can understand that an [aboleth's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) purpose is the psychic domination of all life, for the lives of other creatures have no value to it.

[Aboleths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) can be found throughout the underground waterways of Tal'Dorei, typically living in isolation with only their thralls for company. These aberrations are loath to work together, for their perfect memories never permit them to forget a grudge. It is fortunate that these arrogant creatures are all but incapable of cooperation, for if their genius-level intellects were united, they might well be unstoppable.

During the "Age of Arcanum", an [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) empire covered the length and breadth of Tal'Dorei's subterranean world. This dominion's heart was "Salar", the Unseeable City. Though "Salar" is naught but a ruin in the "Crystalfen Caverns" beneath "Emon" now, [aboleths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) still journey there in hopes of finding some remnant of their lost glory. "Salar" is little more than legend to the world above—but even though few have seen it and survived, the Unseeable City is no myth. Some arcanists even speculate that the lingering psychic footprint of the ruined city is what drew the first "Issylran" settlers to the area, and what inspired them to build "Emon" above it.

### Catfolk

The [catfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/tabaxi-mpmm.md) of Tal'Dorei are as widespread and as variable in shape and color as the cats they resemble. They usually live solitary lives, claiming small territories to call their own, though some catfolk live as small family units with little conflict. Moreover, their feline instinct for solitude doesn't get in the way of catfolk interacting with other people around them. Indeed, many catfolk are highly social around others, safe in the knowledge that they can retreat to a solitude promising safety and calm whenever they need to.

No consistent creation myth exists for these people, who can be found living as cave dwellers in the "Cliffkeep Mountains", as city folk with their own private flats in "Emon", as cunning trackers and community builders in the "Rifenmist Jungle", and more. Generally, catfolk believe that their kind were all once normal animals, transformed by incredible magic in the ancient past. This transformation might have been a gift from the gods when magic washed over the world during the "Age of Arcanum", or when Exandria trembled beneath the divine powers unleashed in the "Calamity".

### Centaurs

During the "Calamity", many "elves" fled into the Fey Realm to escape that terrible war. One elven tribe that remained on Exandria to fight alongside their gods were known as the Horselords of Laphithas. The "elves" of Laphithas rode alongside the Arch Heart against the mortal servants of the Ruiner, but the entire tribe was slain in a burst of chaotic magic when the Arch Heart stabbed the Ruiner through one eye. The overflowing power of the wounded god merged these "elves'" mortal bodies with the bodies of their steeds even as they died.

The Arch Heart rewarded the "elves" of Laphithas by reviving them as [centaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md), who would ride across the "Dividing Plains" forever free of war. [Centaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) have long since diverged from their elven ancestry, viewing themselves as a people all their own. Still, some [centaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) throw their arms wide to the "elves" of "Syngorn" as long-lost cousins, even as others nurture an ancient grudge against them for fleeing when their people's need was greatest. Many of the centaur herds of the plains are incredibly faithful, worshiping the Arch Heart with a fervor unknown even among the "elves".

[Centaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) share an origin with "orcs", who were also originally "elves" before being changed by the conflict between the Arch Heart and the Ruiner. Many [centaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) and "orcs" of the "Dividing Plains" see one another as kindred, but just as with real family, this bond can engender feelings of intense affection or equally intense hatred—or simply indifference. The circumstances of their lives determine the way "orcs" and [centaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) feel about one another, though their kinship brings them into frequent contact either way.

### Dragons

Dragons have existed in Tal'Dorei since the "Founding", when these mighty beings were created by the Platinum Dragon and the Scaled Tyrant to protect their interests on the Material Plane. All folk of Tal'Dorei know the power of dragons, and many people have witnessed it firsthand. Even the youngest humanoid victims of the "Chroma Conclave's" attack on "Emon" are old enough now to be parents, and to have passed down tales of the terror that filled the city's streets as doom rained down from above.

#### Metallic Dragons

Though countless popular stories tell of heroic warriors slaying evil, greedy, and monstrous dragons, the oldest legends of dragonkind speak of their roles as benevolent protectors of the weak. In the time of the world's beginning, the Platinum Dragon created beings in his image, with scales of shining metal and kindly hearts. Those metallic dragons helped the mortal people of Exandria survive the turbulence of the "Founding". But since those days, most metallic dragons have vanished from the world, leaving their kindness and virtue to linger on in myth and legend rather than the chronicles of history.

On clear days, a lucky traveler might look up to the blue skies of the "Dividing Plains" and feel their heart thump faster at the sight of sun glinting off silvery wings high above the world. For the most part, though, those metallic dragons who remain in the world use their shapechanging magic to live among humanoids, watching quietly from the background and gently nudging people in the direction of prosperity. After all, the Platinum Dragon's creations still look upon mortals as their charges—but times have changed. Mortals are now too numerous for the scant remaining metallic dragons to guide them as they once did. But a watchful observer can see the ills of society and whisper a word of caution into the ear of a mortal who might do something about it.

Lest any forget, the metallic dragons are not all friends to mortalkind. For some of these protectors of the small, time has caused them to grow selfish and disillusioned with their creator's commandment. These venal metallic dragons use their silver tongues and sterling reputations to manipulate mortals.

#### Chromatic Dragons

Fire, acid, poison, ice, and lightning rained devastation upon the world when the Betrayer God known as the Scaled Tyrant created the unparalleled warriors that would serve her whims. The greed and malice of chromatic dragons are the stuff of countless legends—as are the mountains of gold and other treasures amassed within their lairs.

Dozens of cruel chromatic dragons lurk in the darkest depths of the forests, the highest mountain peaks, and the most arid, barren wastelands of Tal'Dorei. Though the devastation of the "Chroma Conclave" is not yet three decades past, scores of adventurers have chosen to forget the horror of seeing flesh melt from bone beneath Umbrasyl's acid breath, or beholding scores choke in Raishan's poison fumes. Those adventurers now seek glory by hunting young and ambitious chromatic dragons, and claiming their nascent treasure hoards.

At the same time, not all chromatic dragons cling to the ways of their creator. A number of such dragons witnessed the horrors unleashed by the "Cinder King" and his minions, and recoiled in disgust. Tales are told of how "Westruun" was the beneficiary of a donation of over fifty thousand gold pieces from a mysterious young red dragon who supposedly admired the "Cinder King's" ambition, but was appalled by his flagrant disregard for life.

### Driders

The Betrayer God known as the Spider Queen was one of the first casualties of the "Calamity"—impaled by the Stormlord's thunderspear before her dark elf soldiers ever saw battle. Her blood, thick and silvery, seeped into the earth and pooled in the sunless caverns beneath Exandria. In the centuries that followed her defeat, these pools of divine blood were discovered by the Spider Queen's most loyal dark elf servants, and they drank deeply.

The blood of the Spider Queen granted these drow the goddess's terrible power, and warped their bodies into forms that are half-spider, half-elf. Called [driders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/drider.md), these beings grew in number as more and more drow accepted this gift. In time, the pools of divine blood began to run dry, and the [driders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/drider.md) found themselves tormented by its absence. They now roam the caverns and tunnels beneath Exandria, desperately searching for hidden pools of the silver nectar.

### Fey

People don't discover the fey; rather, the fey discover people. Though enchanted forests are their favored domain, fey folk can be found wherever the power of nature is strong—even a flower garden in the middle of "Emon". Of course, "Emonian" scholars endlessly debate whether the fey typically come to an enchanted forest because of its magic, or whether the magic of such sites blooms because of the fey. The answers to such mysteries are known to the Archfey, of course—but they don't like spilling secrets.

The Fey Realm is a place of intense emotion. There, happiness becomes elation, anger becomes fury, and passions become obsessions. The very shapes of the fey are defined by their innermost feelings, and even fey siblings can take different forms based on what they feel most strongly about. Two daughters of [pixie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) parents are just as likely to be a [sprite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite.md) and a [satyr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) if one sister is drawn to war and the other to revelry. And though uncommon, it is not unheard of for a fey to completely and spontaneously change form after a life-altering event. Since most fey live for upward of three centuries, a particularly unstable fey might take a dozen forms over the course of their life, wildly changing their physical form, voice, gender, likes and dislikes, and more.

Though the fey are beings of chaos and change, one immutable factor of fey life is that all are beholden to the Archfey. The immortal and imperious rulers of feykind, the Archfey rarely travel to Exandria, instead spending their time scheming against each other and plotting elaborate political intrigues. When mortals enter their realm, the Archfey take notice and often spy on them in person, using clever disguises and misdirection to keep those mortals from disrupting the Archfey's own maneuvering. Vox Machina was once pursued by Lord Artagan of the Morncrown, a jovial Archfey who finds the incursions of mortals more amusing than distressing. And there are rumors that Artagan has made his presence known on the Material Plane as well, as a mysterious being known as the Traveler.

The mages of the "Arcana Pansophical" have confirmed the identities of three other Archfey, though little else is known about them. They include Lord Saundor the Forsaken, the reportedly deceased Master of the Shademurk; Lady Elmenore the Unforgiving, High Warqueen of the Burning Vale and Matriarch of the Seelie Court; and Potentate Sammanar, They-Who-Walk-Unseen, keeper of the Sun's Shadow and Master of the Unseelie Court. Additionally, a spy of the "Arcana Pansophical" traveling in the Fey Realm is said to have uncovered rumors of the existence of an Archfey known as the Keeper of the Moontides, or simply the Keeper. Since delivering her first report, however, this spy has not been heard from again.

![A slender, white satyr wit...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter6-feygiant.webp#center "A slender, white satyr with curling horns and golden, goat-like legs, kneels upon a boulder, pouring wine into the mouth of a drunk, happy, two-headed giant of muscular build and wearing nothing but a loincloth.")

### Giantkin

Some "Issylran" myths and legend speak of the giants as the precursors to humanity, calling them the gods' failed attempts to create what would become humankind. Other tales suggest that the giants are what became of "humans" who tried to ascend to godhood, making bargains with fiends and imbibing the elemental essences of primordial spirits.

Regardless of their connection to humanoids, giants have longed dwelled far from humanoid cities and settlements. The so-called highborn giantkin stay isolated because they believe humanoids to be warlike, foolish, and untrustworthy. The lowborn giants who hold a place below the highborn are reclusive because humanoid legends paint them as terrible monsters to be hunted and slain.

Giants have a natural life span of about 300 years, though lives of hardship and toil mean that lowborn giants rarely live past 200 years. Highborn giants in their isolated and idyllic cities usually live full lives and die of old age more than any other cause—though highborn politics can be cutthroat, and assassination has ended the long life of many a giant over the centuries.

#### Lowborn Giants

[Ogres](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre.md), [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md), and [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) occupy the lowest rungs of giant society. The highborn keep them at arm's length, using them as a sort of barrier between humanoid and giant civilizations. The lowborn band together, forming tight-knit social groups that must fight and forage to survive. [Cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) typically rule lowborn settlements, and some [hill giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) warriors ritualistically tear out one eye to emulate their rulers. Zealous [hill giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) worshipers of the Ruiner sometimes do the same, with that god granting them power to survive in exchange for ever-increasing sacrifices.

[Cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md), ogres, and [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) who turn to corrupting magic to help them survive lives of hunger and exile sometimes tumble into a cycle of cruelty and devotion to evil powers from which there is no escape. Their minds and bodies are warped beyond recognition, turning them into [trolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/troll.md) or [oni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/oni.md). These giants gain tremendous power but lose any sense of compassion. Such corrupted giants typically live selfishly, and try to transform lowborn enclaves into their own personal armies of conquest.

#### Highborn Giants

The humanoid peoples of Tal'Dorei divide the highborn giants into five types: [cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md), [fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md), [frost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md), [stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md), and [storm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md). These giants are considered one people divided into different cultures, having adopted different magics, fighting styles, and codes of ethics and law. Highborn giants are proud of their ability to look their kin in the eye as equals, making it ironic how few of them acknowledge the caste divide between highborn and lowborn.

The [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) were once considered highborn, but were stripped of their nobility and exiled by the "Council of Seven Scepters", and their culture has long since fallen into ruin.

##### Cloud Giants

These lofty giants are denizens of Jovatthon, the Castle of Thunder. This mighty citystate flies invisibly above Tal'Dorei, enshrouded in thick storm clouds and tracing a clockwise circular route around the continent that avoids its cloudless, arid heartland. The cloud giants are ruled by two wedded monarchs, currently a City-King in charge of domestic affairs, and a War-King tasked with the defense of Jovatthon against dragons and other highborn giants. The current City-King is a stern, fearsome ruler named Ardokles, while the War-King is a much more charismatic and beloved general named Vasilios.

##### Fire Giants

These subterranean giants dwell in the same tunnels as [drow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md) and [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md), typically beneath volcanically active mountain ranges whose natural magma fuels their forges. The heart of fire giant civilization is the city-state of Vulkanon, located within the deep magma tubes beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains". Though their citadels are spacious and vast, many [fire giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) have a perpetually stooped posture due to the low clearance of their underground homes. They are masters of the forge, and have been known to occasionally ally with the [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) of the "Emberhold" to produce some of the finest arms ever seen in Tal'Dorei. Weapons of Vulkanon steel are prized by mercenaries across the continent, as much for their value as status symbols as their worth in combat.

The ruler of Vulkanon, the Grand Legate Phaestor, has long dreamed of expanding his empire, and the [fire giants'](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) allies have granted them a strategic foothold in Tal'Dorei's darkest depths. [Fire giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) might prove to be a dangerous enemy to the folk of the surface world—but they might also be a fierce ally in the fight against the aberrations lurking in the depths, including the "aboleths" of "Salar".

##### Frost Giants

Few beings can survive the "Neverfields", the frozen wasteland north of the "Cliffkeep Mountains". But the [frost giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md), riding on the backs of chitinous [remorhaz](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md) and [woolly mammoths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md), have risen to be the undisputed rulers of this frigid land. Though their people are mostly nomadic reavers led by petty jarls, they all swear fealty to High King Jorskymmar, who rules from the fortress-city of Jotunborg.

The [frost giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) of Jotunborg are renowned for their ability to tame the fearsome beasts of the "Neverfields"—including the white dragons that haunt the skies of that land. This skill and their knack for surviving in an inhospitable realm has made the giants of Jotunborg a pious people, and most pray to the Wildmother for safety before crossing the ice fields. Some giants who have suffered near-death experiences, whether being trapped beneath an icy lake or smothered by an avalanche, clandestinely join one of the cults of the Chained Oblivion, seeking solace in the inevitability of eternal cold.

##### Stone Giants

Few things are more striking than the sight of a [stone giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) atop a mountain peak, silhouetted against the sun. Some mountain climbers fortunate enough to see such a sight become convinced that they have gazed upon the Dawnfather himself. [Stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) are happy to encourage such rumors, for it makes their existence seem more like myth than fact. These reclusive highborn giantkin live in fortresses carved from the peaks of mountains. Their greatest stronghold is Skyanchor Citadel, a city hidden within a peak of the "Alabaster Sierras", its halls winding from the mountain's deepest roots to its highest summit.

[Stone giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) culture holds physical perfection as the greatest of all virtues, and [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) are obsessed with physical appearance and feats of strength. But unlike the lowborn giantkin who have grown strong and resilient out of struggle, [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) see physical power as an abstract virtue, best used in sporting events. A quadrennial tournament of prowess called the Sky Queen's Favor is held in coliseums atop Skyanchor, and highborn giants from across Tal'Dorei gather there to compete in tests of strength, agility, and endurance. Even the [stone giants'](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) humanoid kin, the half-giant "goliaths", are occasionally present at the Sky Queen's Favor.

##### Storm Giants

The most mysterious of all the highborn, the [storm giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) are rarely seen even by other giantkin. Their flying city-state of Tempestar was destroyed by an unknown force centuries ago, and all the glories of their realm were cast into the "Lucidian Ocean", hundreds of miles off the coast. [Storm giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) now live solitary lives, calling no other giants their neighbors, and caring only for themselves and their families.

Centuries have passed since Tempestar was last the seat of the "Council of Seven Scepters", yet the otherwise-reclusive [storm giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) leader, Sea Dreamer Galadawna, has never missed a meeting of the council. Though she takes little interest in the day-to-day minutiae of highborn society, she ensures that the other giant leaders never forget about her people—or the thunderous might of their sorcerers.

##### Council of Seven Scepters

The highborn are united by a democratic council that convenes annually for one week in the tallest spire of Jovatthon, the [cloud giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md) citadel. The ruler of each giant civilization—including the two rulers of the [cloud giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md)—have a seat on the council, though that seat is sometimes taken by a highly placed ambassador or representative of the ruler. When the council meets, its members deliberate on how best to maintain peace and prosperity. For even as they do their best to maintain a safe distance from the humanoid peoples of Tal'Dorei, the last thing the highborn giants desire is infighting among themselves.

Two of the seven thrones of the council have remained empty for generations. Hillqueen Ovam'mura refused to relinquish her scepter when her [hill giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) people were banished from the ranks of the highborn, and the Scepter of Wodensdottr has gathered dust in Jovatthon's vaults since Woden, demigod of the storm, abandoned the [storm giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) after the fall of Tempestar. Though the Sea Dreamer of Tempestar has never missed a gathering of the council, she has thus far refused to reclaim her throne or scepter, and the responsibilities that come with both.

### Gnolls

As their canine appearance suggests, "gnolls" are descended from [hyenas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hyena.md) that once roamed the "Dividing Plains". A pack of these creatures was caught in the divine eminence of a Demon Prince that did battle in the "Calamity". When the nimbus of that demon's unholy power faded, the beasts were transformed.

Today, most "gnolls" are nomadic groups led by a matriarch and her mate. Many people of the "Dividing Plains" see "gnolls" as demonic monsters, and are driven to acts of cruelty against them by their fear. Nevertheless, many [gnoll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) clans live side by side with the other humanoid peoples of Tal'Dorei in small towns across the plains, including the Dustpaw "gnolls" and the people of "Turst Fields".

### Lizardfolk

The [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) of Tal'Dorei emerged from the "K'Tawl Swamp" in the "Age of Arcanum". Mages from an unnamed flying city descended into the swamp and conducted intense magical experiments on the local fauna. Some mutated into [giant lizards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md), others into slithering swamp serpents—and others into humanoid beings. The mages took a few of these [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) as specimens, and left the other fruits of their experiments behind.

In time, these abandoned [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) used their cunning minds and skilled hands to create tools. They called themselves the Kuul'tevir—noble masters of the earth and water. These folk advanced rapidly, and though they never matched the heights of the flying cities of the magi who created them, they built magnificent domains filled with towering spires and glimmering magical waterfalls.

When the decadence of the "Age of Arcanum" gave way to the chaos of the "Calamity", the Kuul'tevir delved deep into corrupting magic to save their grandeur. For a time, their people prospered, bolstered by the magic of demons and evil gods. But in the end, the desire to survive at any cost turned the Kuul'tevir's rulers against one another. Cabals of petty warlocks tore the [lizardfolk's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) magnificent societies apart, and the evil magic they wielded began to devour even the magic that the ancient mages had used to turn them from simple reptiles into a majestic people.

Today, the majesty of the Kuul'tevir is little more than distant myth. Most [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) live in small communities in swamps, jungles, and fiery mountains across Tal'Dorei. Some live in cities, especially those with hot, humid climates, but no [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) today possess the supernatural poise and power that they did in the "Age of Arcanum". Today, the [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) are a people like any other—just trying to survive in modest comfort. But many still cling to the mythic memory of their ancient civilization and have allied themselves with terrible tyrants such as "Thordak the Cinder King" in an attempt to resurrect their lost glory.

The [serpentfolk of Vos'skyriss](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/vosskyriss-serpentfolk-tdcsr.md) still dwell on "Visa Isle", south of "Daggerbay". They are more serpentine than lizard-like, but it is suspected that their origins are similar to that of the [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md).

### Sahuagin

Known by sailors as "sea devils," the shark-like [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) are both enemy and ally to "humans" who ride the waves, and are rumored to have spawned from a bottomless trench in the ocean floor. Pods of [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) have no de facto leader, and usually have no more than six members. However, several pods might band together and collaborate on tasks they could not accomplish alone, forming schools. These schools follow the will of the majority, and disobedience is rare.

The few sea devils who dominate multiple schools through personal strength are known as [barons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin-baron.md), who are as feared as they are revered. [Sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) schools that fall under the sway of a [baron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin-baron.md) often become known for their piracy and hunger for slaughter, as the members of the school are directed to steal treasure to appease their tyrant's greed. Other schools might offer their services as mercenaries, aiding those humanoids willing to pay for their ferocity.

[Sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) pods sometimes fall under the corrupting influence of "aboleths" or other aquatic aberrations, with these aberrations taking on roles as demigods and the [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) who obey them becoming cultists. Instead of plundering ships for treasure, these [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) engineer shipwrecks and drag the survivors before their cruel overlord, who adds those humanoids to the ranks of their brainwashed thralls. The most feared of all these unholy figures is one that truly is the progeny of one of the "Betrayer Gods": Uk'otoa, a many-eyed [leviathan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/leviathan-mpmm.md) spawn of the Cloaked Serpent that is supposedly imprisoned deep beneath the "Lucidian Ocean".

## New Creatures

Tal'Dorei is filled with wondrous creatures and characters. Whether they prove to be allies or enemies to the heroes, these beings' game statistics are provided here. These creatures are designed to supplement the monsters found in the fifth edition core rules, not replace them. Tal'Dorei is also filled with countless classic monsters, and adventures here will incorporate both familiar mythic creatures and the unique creatures of Exandria.

> Some creatures and NPCs in this section wear or wield magic items that increase their power, or that give them unique traits usable in or out of combat. New magic items are identified as such, and can be found in "chapter 5" of this book. All other magic items can be found in the fifth edition core rules.

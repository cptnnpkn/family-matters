# Chapter 1: Welcome to Tal'Dorei
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, p. 7* 

![Two opposing sides of a ba...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-splash.webp#center "Two opposing sides of a battlefield fiercely clash, a starry night sky in the background. Zan Tal'Dorei, a human woman with long brown hair wearing elvish armor, wields a mighty longsword as she leaps toward a blond man, King Trist Drassig, who wears half-plate armor and wields a bloody greatsword.")

Tal'Dorei is a land of epic adventure, filled with heroes who do great deeds for love, for justice, and—maybe more often than not—for gold and their own egos. Villains are draped in shadow and draw upon the power of cruel gods—but they are just as motivated by love, their own twisted concepts of justice, and their hunger for gold, power, and glory.

Tal'Dorei is a land created by Matthew Mercer to introduce his friends to fantasy roleplaying games, and he filled it with the greatest high fantasy tropes and played them to the hilt—and then twisted them, defying his own clichés when it would hit the hardest.

This book is for Game Masters who wish to run fantasy roleplaying game campaigns set on the continent of *Critical Role's* first campaign, and for the players who will create characters for those games. The game mechanics in this book use "fifth edition rules," but it also includes enough lore about the world to form the foundation for a game using the rules of any fantasy RPG.

## Lands of Tal'Dorei

The name Tal'Dorei refers to three things throughout this book. Most often, Tal'Dorei means the continent that is home to all of the people, locations, monsters, magic items, and more within these pages. It is one of four major continents on the world of Exandria. Tal'Dorei can also mean the Republic of Tal'Dorei, the largest nation on the continent. And finally, Tal'Dorei was first the surname of a mighty hero who lent her name to the land that she helped liberate from evil.

See ""A History of Tal'Dorei"" later in this chapter for more details about the heroic "Zan Tal'Dorei", the land she founded, and her descendants.

The continent of Tal'Dorei encompasses several nations and independent city-states, all of which are home to diverse peoples who view the world in ways influenced by their cultures and the lands they call home. The most significant nations of Tal'Dorei include:

### The Republic of Tal'Dorei

From the great city of "Emon" in the west, across the vast "Dividing Plains", and even as far as the isolated city-state of "Whitestone" in the northeast, the Republic of Tal'Dorei spans the breadth of the continent that bears its name. It is ruled by a council of elected representatives and is cordially allied with all other nations on the continent.

### The Ashari

The elementally attuned Ashari people are reclusive and dedicated to their mission of safeguarding elemental rifts across the world. Two of the greatest rifts exist in Tal'Dorei, and the Earth Ashari of "Terrah" and the Air Ashari of "Zephrah" keep watch over them from their secluded homes.

### The Deep Halls of Kraghammer

Deep beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains" is "Kraghammer", the ancestral home of Tal'Dorei's dwarven people. Though "Kraghammer" is home to people other than "dwarves", its dark and claustrophobic halls act as a deterrent to non-dwarven residents—as does the dwarf clans' famous inhospitality.

### The Verdant Enclave of Syngorn

In the heart of the trackless "Verdant Expanse" is a city of "elves" who hid in the Fey Realm from a war that nearly annihilated all life on Exandria. "Syngorn" is welcoming to all who brave the "Verdant Expanse" to reach them, though there is an expectation that those who visit take pains not to flaunt the strict and ancient rules of "Syngornian" society, lest their stay come to a swift and unceremonious end.

### The Iron Authority

This imperial force rules the "Beynsfal Plateau" in the southernmost reaches of the continent. There they train legions of soldiers in an endless campaign to conquer the entire "Rifenmist Peninsula". The other powers of Tal'Dorei are just beginning to take notice of the movements of the "Iron Authority", but most of their knowledge is based in rumor. The "Tal'Dorei Council" has little interest in drawing the authority's ire while it is preoccupied with its conquest of "Rifenmist".

## What's in This Book?

"Chapter 1" is an introduction to Tal'Dorei's lands and history. It also describes certain fundamental details about the world of Exandria as a whole, including its calendar, the planes, and the cosmos. Finally, this chapter provides an overview of Tal'Dorei's society today—and the brewing tensions and secrets that Game Masters can use to plot their own campaigns.

"Chapter 2" describes the allegiances player characters and non-player characters (NPCs) may have to deepen their connection to the world. Their allegiances may be to factions, such as governments or guilds, or to the gods. These divine beings can only affect the Material Plane through their mortal followers, or occasionally supernatural messengers like celestials or fiends.

"Chapter 3" is the Tal'Dorei Gazetteer, a detailed look at all of Tal'Dorei's regions and cities, their points of interest, the people who reside within them, and the quests that heroic adventurers might undertake there.

"Chapter 4" contains new options that players can use to build their characters, including story descriptions of the different ancestries; new subclasses, backgrounds, and feats; and a handful of optional rules for the whole table.

"Chapter 5" contains advice to help Game Masters create exciting and compelling campaigns in Tal'Dorei, and magic items that you can give your players as treasure during their perilous adventures—including the unstoppably powerful "Vestiges of Divergence".

"Chapter 6" presents game statistics for monsters and NPCs that you can use to challenge your characters or aid them in a pinch. Among them are the legendary heroes Vox Machina, some twenty years after the conclusion of their greatest adventures.

## Calendar, Time, and the Cosmos

![An elven woman adorned in ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-cosmos.webp#center "An elven woman adorned in a pale gown stands with her back to us, her wavy, brown hair blowing in the wind. She looks up at a starry night sky with a large white crescent moon and a smaller, full red moon.")

The world of Exandria is a planet with regular seasons and a wide variety of climes, ranging from frigid ice caps to arid deserts, temperate forests, windswept plains, sweltering jungles, and storm-tossed oceans. It orbits a single sun, is orbited in turn by two moons, and is surrounded by distant stars that twinkle in the evening skies.

The ancient people of Exandria told time by these celestial bodies, and the "elves" created a calendar based on their movements.

### Calendar

The calendar year of Exandria runs a total of 328 days, grouped into seven-day weeks over the course of eleven months. These months are outlined below in the order of their arrival within the calendar year, along with their respective number of days and holidays common throughout Tal'Dorei (many of which are detailed within the ""Pantheon of Exandria"" section in "chapter 2").

#### Counting Years

In Exandria, the years are most commonly counted by a reckoning known as ""Post Divergence"," with year 0 being the fateful year that the "Prime Deities" ended the "Calamity" by sealing all the gods behind the Divine Gate. This book describes the world as it is in the year 836 P.D. If you're familiar with the *Critical Role* campaigns, this year is twenty-four years after the end of Campaign 1 (Vox Machina) and toward the end of Campaign 2 (The Mighty Nein).

#### Months and Seasons

The names of the months and days of the week vary between cultures, but the elven calendar described here is the standard means of reckoning dates in Tal'Dorei—as well as in most nations around the world, for ease of international trade and diplomacy.

Just as in our world, there are four seasons, and the year ends and begins just after the winter solstice.

The first blush of spring in Tal'Dorei is felt as new flowers bloom on Wild's Grandeur, a holy day on the 20th of Dualahei. The official start of the season, however, is observed a week earlier and celebrated with games, music, and just-ripened food at the Renewal Festival. Summer brings hotter days toward the middle of Unndilar. The noonday sun of the 26th day is called the Zenith, and this solstice is considered the first true moment of the summer.

The colors change and winds cool as autumn begins in the early days of the month of Fessuran, marked by the Harvest's Close on the 3rd day. The chill of winter arrives to bring longer nights and cleansing snow on Barren Eve, the 2nd of Duscar, a nighttime celebration and remembrance of those who fell in battle.

The seven days of the week are named Miresen, Grissen, Whelsen, Conthsen, Folsen, Yulisen, and Da'leysen. Each day is 24 hours long, and most city-dwellers in the Republic of Tal'Dorei are expected to work eight hours of that day—except for Yulisen and Da'leysen, which comprise the weekend, and on holidays.

These social rules don't necessarily apply to cultures where sleeping patterns are different (such as in "Syngorn", where most of its people are "elves" who trance a mere four hours of the day), or to people outside of cities—such as farmers, who rise with the sun, and traveling merchants and adventurers, who work highly unusual hours.

#### Using a Calendar

The Exandrian calendar is intentionally quite different from our own. The creation of calendars is a messy and often illogical process, with strange artifacts of their making that linger on only because of tradition—and because it would be too much of a hassle to get the entire world to change their way of counting time and days.

You don't need to bother with the Exandrian calendar in your home game. It's perfectly reasonable for you to use a nice, simple seven-day week, thirty-day month, and twelve-month year. You may even use our names for the months and the days of the week so that when an NPC tells the party to meet them at noon on "Grissen, Misuthar 7th," they're basically talking about "Tuesday, February 7th."

However, if you want to immerse your players in the fantasy world of Exandria, using this unfamiliar calendar may help you on your quest.

### Catha and Ruidus

When the people of Tal'Dorei gaze into the morning sky, they see the sun, a blazing disc the size of a gold piece, looking back at them. It is the domain of the Dawnfather, a god of life and light honored politely by nearly all the realm's denizens.

At night, the skies are filled with countless distant stars, a gleaming silver-white moon called Catha, and occasionally, a dim, ruddy moon called Ruidus that is nearly half Catha's size. Both moons are the domain of the Moonweaver, a capricious god of trickery and illusions, but there are sects throughout the world that believe only Catha represents the Moonweaver's cunning and grace. Catha's pearly glow is said to bless the just with cunning and caution, and to make hidden the goodhearted when they require stealth and subtlety.

Ruidus, on the other hand, is so surrounded by disquieting rumors and folkloric tales of misfortune that some believe another unknown god or power rules this small, reddish-brown moon. Cultures around the world tell countless legends of prideful rulers who made grand plans or attempted deeds under the moon's full light—when it shines a brilliant vermilion rather than its usual ruddy color—and were forced to watch in horror as their endeavors fell to unforeseen misfortune. It is said those who fall afoul of Ruidus failed to give it the deference it is due—and so superstitious folk rarely dare to make plans while the full light of Ruidus shines above, let alone enact them.

Worse yet, some tales forebode dark fortunes for those born under the light of a full Ruidus, a curse of ill luck that will follow them throughout their lives. Though the cruel practice of moon-sacrifice is no longer permitted in any of Tal'Dorei's cities, some far-flung settlements still secretly sacrifice children born under a full Ruidus to "save" them from a cursed life, and to appease the dark and unknowable appetites of the red moon.

Fortunately for the superstitious, Ruidus is rarely full. While its cousin, Catha, completes a full cycle approximately once a month, Ruidus's haunting, half-year orbit, combined with its eerie and unexplainable tendency to simply not appear in the sky on certain nights or glow with unknown light, creating an unexpected full moon, has only added to its mythic reputation as an omen of ill fortune.

### Planes

Though this book concerns itself mostly with the world of Exandria, and specifically the continent of Tal'Dorei, high-level adventurers may eventually gain magic that allows them to travel to other planes of existence beyond the material world in which Exandria resides.

The planes surrounding Exandria are similar to the planes presented in fifth edition lore. Below are brief descriptions of some of the planes that a party of powerful adventurers may travel to. These planes go by many poetic and fanciful names.

#### Material Plane

The Material Plane is a land where natural laws work as we expect. It is a place of all four elements, and of plants, animals, and minerals. Exandria is but one of many worlds on the Material Plane—though none but the most accomplished astronomers have become aware of this fact, much less devised a way of traveling between material worlds.

#### Elemental Planes

When the Protean Gods discovered Exandria, it was like a barren ship adrift in a sea of churning, chaotic elements. As a part of their creation, the elements were thrust away from the world. Some theorize that the Elemental Planes were created from this banished chaos, while others believe the elemental chaos seeped into the Material Plane from tears in the fabric of the planes.

The latter may be more likely, as rifts between the Elemental Planes can be found across Exandria. The largest of these rifts are tended to by the four Ashari civilizations, and any who gaze within find wild wastelands of pure elemental power: roiling seas of fire, towering mountains of gnashing stone, infinite skies filled with cloud-top settlements, and endless, stormy oceans of water.

#### Faerie, Shadow, and Ether

Parallel to Exandria are odd reflections of its reality. The Fey Realm is a plane of natural beauty and ferocity, inhabited by fey folk. The Plane of Shadow is a dour, sinister mirror of the world that is. And the Ethereal Plane is a hazy film across the material world, as if it were viewed through an old, cloudy mirror, inhabited not only by restless spirits, but also by predators that target those who cling to the world of the living.

#### Astral Plane

All the prior planes exist directly adjacent to the Material Plane, buttressing and occasionally co-mingling with its inhabitants. All the planes that follow are separated from the material world by a vast sea of starlight, barren asteroids, and misty nebulae of unpredictable magic. In the ancient past, arcanists had to craft vessels to sail the treacherous sea of stars to travel between their home plane and the mysterious Outer Planes.

These days, magic such as the plane shift spell has allowed planar travelers to bypass these methods, but there are still a number of strange creatures and forgotten, imprisoned demigods who float eternally through the Cosmic Sea.

#### Outer Planes

The "Prime Deities" imprisoned the "Betrayer Gods" in prison planes after the "Founding", and retired to planes of their own creation after the "Divergence". Over time, the divine beings on these planes reshaped their new homes in their own image, creating places where natural laws don't function as one native to the Material Plane might expect.

All of these planes are strongly aligned to one or more cosmic principles of good, evil, law, and chaos, based on the divine powers that reside there. Because of the Divine Gate established after the "Divergence", no divine powers can depart these planes, for the sake of all Creation. The gods' supernatural creations can pass through the Divine Gate, though the more powerful they grow—and thus, the closer they come to divinity—the harder it is for them to pass through. However, mortals and lesser supernatural beings who possess magic to travel between the planes can travel to and from Outer Planes like the Hells, the Abyss, Elysium, and Pandemonium unhindered by the Divine Gate.

![An older, white woman with...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-planes.webp#center "An older, white woman with short grey hair stands in a study, pages flying around her. One hand summons a runic circle. The other she holds before her, opening a magic, red portal where we see a dark tower and four winged creatures flying about it. She is dressed in blue, white and gold embroidered clothing with a purple sash and scrolls hanging from her belt.")

#### Realms Beyond

Far beyond even the divine Outer Planes is a realm where all laws of nature break down completely. Mortal senses have no way of properly perceiving the nature of these far-distant realms, and most minds that try to comprehend them snap under the strain of so much unfamiliar stimulus. These maddening realities and the alien horrors that live within them are mercifully kept away from the known multiverse by the unimaginable distance of space.

Some creatures of the beyond have lurked on the Material Plane since ancient times, perhaps at the invitation of the Chained Oblivion itself, or because the divine powers unleashed in the "Calamity" punched holes in time and space that allowed such aberrations to slither into Exandria unimpeded.

Major known locations of aberrant activity in Tal'Dorei include "Yug'Voril" beneath "Kraghammer", the "Crystalfen Caverns" beneath "Emon", and the realm of "Ruhn-Shak" beneath the "Stormcrest Mountains".

#### Demiplanes

Massive, infinite spaces such as the Material, Elemental, and Outer Planes are not the only types of reality. Through the use of powerful magic, arcanists can create stable demiplanes—finite pockets of extraplanar reality that they can shape to their whims. These "pocket dimensions" exist as bubbles of floating color within the Cosmic Sea, and can only be traced or penetrated by extremely powerful, lost magical arts.

![A view of a valley between...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-creation.webp#center "A view of a valley between two large mountain peaks. Green terraced fields ascend up the mountain on the left and a small hut sits at the top of it. A second terraced field sits at the base of the mountain on the right. A golden dragon flies between the mountains in the distance overhead.")

Where did Tal'Dorei come from? The origin of this land is a time-shrouded question that everyone has pondered in some way, from the most exalted, world-traveling hero to the common farmer who has never traveled three miles beyond their village. Everyone has their own ideas on where Tal'Dorei, and all of the wide world of Exandria, came from. These varied thoughts all have some things in common, since they are all born of jumbled misunderstandings of ancient myths told orally from bard to bard, then passed from father to daughter, and eventually codified into religious re-writings of history that favor the teachings of a given deity.

To speak a full and accurate truth of Tal'Dorei is an impossible task, yet Tal'Dorei is known for creating folk who regularly do the impossible. What follows is the Myth of Exandria, an account based on the investigations and best efforts of Tal'Dorei's foremost scholars—the homegrown "Alabaster Lyceum" of "Emon", and the international knowledge-seekers and anti-propagandists of the "Cobalt Soul". These two organizations have assembled this history by digging beneath the layers of dust and decay that hide battles long past, unearthing texts long thought burned and censored, and exhuming historical treasures from tombs of heroes long forgotten. The details are often debated, for the question of the land's origin remains—consuming the curious, calling those hungry for purpose, and fueling the business of adventuring to delve into the tantalizing unknown places of the world.

### Myth of Exandria

Before the history of the lands of Tal'Dorei can be explored, its context in the history of Exandria itself must be thoroughly established. The world of Exandria is home to four major continents, dozens of nations, and untold tiny pockets of civilization amid a wondrous, dangerous wilderness. Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.

Even so, life ever seeks to understand its inception. In this report, the collected minds of the "Cobalt Soul" and "Emon's" "Alabaster Lyceum" can say, with only the most trivial of doubts, that the city of Vasselheim in "Othanzia" truly deserves its title of the "Dawn City." It is here, to our researchers' best understanding, where the stories of all mortal peoples begin. Vasselheim became Exandria's oldest surviving city by virtue of not just being built long ago, but by enduring the "Calamity" (which shall be elucidated presently), a miraculous feat that few other charted settlements can claim to have accomplished.

In short, Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, and the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophe. It is these sources that this joint research initiative treats as its primary documents, though great effort has been made to corroborate their claims through later sources. It is in the chronicles of Vasselheim that the earliest account of the myth of the "Founding" is recorded—and indeed, this history is the most commonly accepted origin of the world in the Republic of Tal'Dorei. Though countless regional variations muddy the historical record, the broad strokes of this mythic history are undeniable.

#### The Founding

Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fire, seething oceans, and churning, gnashing rock. Through the ashen skies of Primordial Creation, the gods arrived from an unknown realm located beyond the ether. These ambitious divinities—young and still formless—looked down upon this roiling realm and saw potential for great strength and outstanding beauty, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.

From the divine hands of the Arch Heart sprung forth the First Children, the "elves". It is thought that they were made in their creator's image, yet it is just as likely that the Arch Heart, and all the gods who shared their ideas with them, actually adopted forms inspired by the image of their creations. The First Children walked the lush Green and gazed upon the heavenly Blue as the gods tamed Primordial Creation around them.

Not long after, in the scale of the cosmos, a second mortal creation was wrought by the divine All-Hammer: the "dwarves", a hearty people imbued with the desire to continue the gods' work—taming a primordial world filled with the craft and invention of the divinity that lay beyond the ashen void. In their turn, a third people were given life by the passionate lovers of Order and Chaos, the Lawbearer and the Wildmother. Their children were the "humans", endowed with hearts of passion to bring meaning to the world as it assumed an orderly form. Yet in their hearts burned a spark of chaos, cursing them with short life just as it blessed them with the unquenchable ambitions, mirth, and curiosities of the gods that crafted them.

As a note from the High Curator of "Emon's" Cobalt Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of Exandria began to worship them—yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of the people.

As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other creations followed, giving life to Exandria's many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear, for while the "elves", "dwarves", and "humans" were undeniably Exandria's first races, the identities of the many Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City's chroniclers.

These myriad young races explored their freshly founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world around them.

This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic, and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good—but fragile, and in need of guardians.

Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Tal'Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization's reach stretched across the world. The people praised the gods for their newfound safety, and their prayers gave them forms, names, and purpose.

#### Wrath of the Primordials

Yet the realm refused to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance of mortalkind's magical gifts. Seas swelled and seethed. Flames erupted from below with greater intensity than any had seen before. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who were born in the primeval chaos of the world the gods had found: the Primordials. These elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the land now rose from their unseen domain to sunder it once more. The gods watched as their children were crushed between gnashing rocks and fed to formless terrors unleashed in the wake of the destruction. Thus were the seeds of Exandria's greatest cataclysm set into motion.

Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they wished to abandon this world for another. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join the Primordials in reclaiming the realm for chaos, so that they could move on to start anew. Others wished to prove they could tame the world for their beloved children. This caused a divide among the gods. The schismatic deities, known today as the "Betrayer Gods", joined their songs and swords to those of chaos and destruction, taking and twisting their children into the image of their intent.

The cosmos itself seemed to recognize the magnitude of the battle on Exandria, and beings of Order and Chaos spilled forth from the still-young multiverse. Creatures of chaos emerged from a formless void that Exandria's peoples came to call the Abyss.

These demons fed upon the suffering of the wounded and the dying, and grew cruel. Sentinels of order emerged from a distant realm of celestial harmony. The "Prime Deities" beseeched these celestials to aid them. In turn, the "Betrayer Gods" forced order upon the demons and made them devils, perfectly lawful soldiers who lived only to cause harm.

As the clash of gods and Primordials spiraled out of control, the desperate mortal races sought their own way to defend themselves from the rebellious elements. Seeing that their creations still suffered, the Arch Heart taught them the secrets of making magic themselves. The most intelligent and inquisitive mortal minds followed the path the gods had revealed to them, and created incantations and formulae to create new spells on their own terms, without the aid of divine power. These people called themselves arcanists, for they were masters of the arcane secrets of magic.

With their potent new magics, these resourceful mortals subdued the Primordials long enough for the "Prime Deities" to banish their traitorous kin to secluded prison planes. With the "Betrayer Gods" locked away, the gods were overjoyed to see the resourcefulness of their children. The defeated Primordials were destroyed, and from their ever-enduring essences, the gods channeled their wild and destructive powers into the Elemental Planes that surround the material world of Exandria.

For the first time since the Creation, Exandria finally settled into an idyllic peace. From this peace was born the first enduring mortal civilization, the heart of which was a grand city called Vasselheim, the Cradle of Creation and the Dawn City.

Culture developed anew, the races ventured beyond to explore and discover their own lands, and great music filled the air to give name to this world once and for all: Exandria.

#### Age of Arcanum

> [!quote]- A quote from Anonymous  
> 
> The foremost scholars of our day would make it seem an indisputable fact that the gods created Exandria. That they blessed us with the bounty that all peoples of the world now make use of. So too, they say, was magic their gift to us. But such zealots ignore the fact that there is another likelihood: that the gods did not create mortals, and their world—but the opposite. That the dreams of mortals mingled in the wild magic of the young world, and gave that magic form and order: divinity. Of course, the dogmatic zealots of our day will dismiss such ideas as heresy—but not you, reader! The avid mind feeds not on dogma, but on new ideas!

![Two large pieces of land f...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-arcanum.webp#center "Two large pieces of land float in the sky among the clouds, with each piece of land connected by arcane, purple chains. Underneath each land mass are blue crystals—it's these that cause the land to float. Upon each piece of land is a large colorful city consisting of many towers, parapets, and domes.")

Ages passed, and society flourished. Great kingdoms sprung up. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new forms of life and power.

Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the very magic which allowed mortalkind to prosper also instilled a deep rot within their civilizations. The arcanists of the world grew arrogant. They came to see their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, and that with a sophisticated enough command of magic, they could become as powerful as the gods themselves. Though this hurt and surprised the "Prime Deities" who had imprisoned their kin for the sake of their children, they sought to sympathize with the willfulness of their creations, remaining out of love and hoping that the mortals would learn the error of their ways.

The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty, but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Rather than universal goodwill and comfort for all, the "Age of Arcanum" came to be defined by endless petty squabbles over wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for their scraps. Tantalizing rumors of a path to immortality slithered through the most decadent circles of magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name lost and presumed to be struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making of her the first and only living mortal to ascend. The name of this original death god was likewise lost to history. Only the title of his now-godly successor, the Matron of Ravens, survives.

Her victory over divinity was a catalyst for many of the horrors of the "Age of Arcanum". An archmage named Vespin Chloras, renowned throughout ancient Vasselheim for his wealth, skill, and cruelty, was inspired by this display. He sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the Betrayers into the mortal world.

In their imprisonment, these Gods of Hatred and Despair had warped their prisons into reflections of their depravity. The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos, a byproduct of the gods' Creation, was twisted into a place of evil. Countless other planes of cruelty were born from the "Betrayer Gods'" hatred, and those realms' evil depths endlessly churned forth horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed.

Released unto the mortal world once more, the "Betrayer Gods'" urge to ruin was supplanted by the desire to dominate, and they turned their sights first to the archmage who had freed them, making Vespin the first of their many mortal thralls. Records of diabolical texts safeguarded within the libraries of the "Alabaster Lyceum" suggest that Vespin, now long dead, serves the "Betrayer Gods" to this day—now as a devil at the left hand of the Lord of the Hells. These corrupt gods sought out the shattered remnants of the devils they had crafted and the demons they conscripted, and secretly created with them a fearsome new kingdom on the far end of the world, the capital of which was named Ghor Dranas, the Gathering of Shadows.

In this land, where the twisted power of the "Betrayer Gods'" corrupted planes seeped into the world, the lords of evil welcomed mortals whose heartlessness and lust for power made them susceptible to the gods' grand promises. The most fertile soil of all for these noxious seeds lay in mortal hearts obsessed with the infinite power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the "Betrayer Gods" soon made their presence known to the world with a surprise assault on Vasselheim itself.

Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of their protectors, the metallic dragons, and even a number of the "Prime Deities" themselves. The creators descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle, which pitted gods against mortals and heroes against demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights, until the dark forces were forced to retreat, their surprise attack thwarted.

Yet this victory was a tainted one. Evil had been repulsed momentarily, but the revelation of such a terrible foe incited an arcane arms race. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the "Betrayer Gods", who could be true allies? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, what value did mortal lives hold? Fearing all powers but their own, the most self-interested and singular human arcanists warped their greatest creations, magical instruments of prosperity and joy, into arms and armor of horrific power. The "dwarves'" fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed further into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. "Elves" used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never before seen.

For the first time since the awakening of the Primordials, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the "Calamity".

### The Calamity

Few records remain of the terrible war that followed, but its effects are still felt today. Most tales that remain are of great champions who the "Prime Deities" blessed with their power. Some deities created warriors of their own from light and holy fire. Others imbued fragments of their power into the weapons now called "Vestiges of Divergence". More still bestowed blessings upon mortals and called them champions. One tale even tells of a champion blessed by three of the gods in their times of greatest need. Now all but forgotten, this Apotheon was forced by fate into terrible battles across the world.

The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles of gods and mortals frayed the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world and bringing utter annihilation. Even the ley lines that direct the flow of magic across Exandria like veins direct blood through the body show signs of being warped by the raw power that the Calamity unleashed. Some well-preserved ruins of the ancient civilizations remain, such as the Drowned City of Cael Morrow in the lands of "Marquet", but for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the face of Exandria.

So great was the loss of life during the war that even liberal estimates suggest no more than a third of Exandria's population survived it. This unthinkable devastation inspired some civilizations to flee Exandria entirely and seek refuge on other planes, scattering the Children of Creation across the multiverse. By the war's end, the only bastion of civilization left on the face of Exandria was the Dawn City itself: Vasselheim.

### The Divergence

In the wake of the "Calamity", the victorious "Prime Deities" once more banished their traitorous kin to their realms of deception and hate. The world entered a long, dark period of recovery, as history had to be recovered and purpose restored, and the threat of the "Betrayer Gods" still loomed heavily upon the minds of all. Even the "Prime Deities" felt guilt for their role in the conflict, for it was the unrestrained clash of divine power that had unleashed such horror upon the world.

The records of the Scalebearers assert that the Platinum Dragon and the Lawbearer descended upon Vasselheim and spoke a decision: the "Prime Deities" would depart from the world and establish a Divine Gate that would forever prevent any god from ever acting directly upon Exandria again. This proclamation shocked the other "Prime Deities" and the beleaguered survivors of the war in equal measure, but while mortals railed against this announcement, the other gods quickly realized that the decision of the two most dutiful and self-sacrificing of their number was unimpeachable and just.

Thus, in hopes of ensuring such ruin would not befall Exandria again, they left their children to rebuild civilization anew within the walls of Vasselheim and beyond. The Creators returned to their own realms, sealing all divine powers behind their newly constructed Divine Gate. Only in this way could they prevent their corrupted brethren from physically returning to the Material Plane.

Much time has passed since, and the world has been reborn once again. The gods still exhibit their influence and guidance from beyond the Divine Gate, bestowing their knowledge and power to their most devout worshipers, but the path of mortals is now their own to make. New cities, kingdoms, and cultures have retaken the world, building over the ashes of the old. New songs fill the air, and the hope of a brighter future drives people day after day, while buried ruins and forgotten relics remind all people of a darker time—and of mistakes that should never be repeated.

### Origins of Tal'Dorei

Following the creation, and subsequent razing, of Exandria, a "post-Divergence" world was now left to rise from the ashes and begin a new era. While every region had its own rebirth following the terrible destruction of the "Calamity", the continent that now bears the name of this setting shall remain the focus. The modern calendar began in the year 0 P.D. ("Post-Divergence"), over eight hundred years before the writing of this text. Though the modern nation-state of Tal'Dorei did not emerge for some time after year 0, the history of Tal'Dorei truly began with the founding of "Gwessar".

#### Gwessar

At the dawning of modern history, what is now known as the continent of Tal'Dorei housed the germinating seeds of civilization. It was the hardy, dependable "dwarves" who best weathered the war between gods and mortals, beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains". Dozens of dwarven redoubts rose and fell in the tumult of the "Calamity" and the uncertain era that followed it. For many years, "dwarves" lived in the tunnels beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains", leaderless and chaotic, until the various clans unified to form the subterranean city of "Kraghammer". Proud of their grand new home, the dwarf clans were content to remain beneath the earth. They saw the war-scarred surface world as a source of naught but misery and death, and their new underground domain as a place of undiscovered prosperity. This city was dug underneath the mountains, and its deep roots, though young, survived where more ancient ancestral halls were annihilated. Clan Jaggenstrike were the architects of "Kraghammer's" hardy, unassailable redoubts, and easily became the first ruling clan of the "Kraghammer" "dwarves".

While the "dwarves" busied themselves excavating the world below, a group of "elves" appeared suddenly in the south. At the outset of the "Calamity", a society of "elves" used a powerful, obscure ritual to transport many of their people to safety on another plane: the Fey Realm, a plane of primordial beauty where elven legend says the Arch Heart lovingly fashioned their people before placing them upon the face of Exandria. They returned at the turning of the ages under the guidance of an elven sorceress named Yenlara Alderwreath.

The "elves" rallied around her both for her defiant strength and for her compassion in the face of adversity. It was under Yenlara's wise rule that elven society once again began to reform. Upon returning to Exandria, Yenlara led her people westward to the "Verdant Expanse", an untamed forest born from the residual elemental power that lingered after the end of the "Calamity".

So beautiful was the forest they settled in that Yenlara's people were the first "elves" known to bear the now-widespread name of syn'alfen—wood "elves", in Common parlance. Likewise, the beauty of their forest home inspired the name of their first settlement: "Syngorn", the great elvenhome that stands proud within the "Verdant Expanse" to this very day.

As Yenlara's people began to explore beyond the forest, they found vast fields of grass emerging from the ash-darkened ground, with tall, snowcapped mountains visible on the horizon. Overwhelmed by the beauty of the restored world, the syn'alfen called their new land "Gwessar", the Fields of Joy, a name by which "elves" (and those enamored with elven culture) still call the continent of Tal'Dorei to this day.

![The back of a young elven ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-gwessar.webp#center "The back of a young elven boy wearing a white tunic stands in a bush of pink and purple flowers under a forest grove. He looks out onto a golden plain bathed in sunlight at the base of a mountain range in the horizon.")

The "dwarves" and "elves" are long-lived people, and when they struggled to rebuild their civilizations, there were those among them who still remembered the world that was. Humanity was not so fortunate. Human histories, written by wasteland warlords in fading ink on waterlogged parchment and vellum, did not survive the years. Yet, somehow, humanity endured. Several centuries after the Jaggenstrike "dwarves" began this period of renewal, a clan of "humans" braved the angry Ozmit Sea and sailed to "Gwessar's" western coast from the continent of "Issylra", though whether or not they came from Vasselheim itself is unknown.

These people had the sea in their blood, and leapt from island to island for generations, but something called them to "Gwessar". The ruins of their first settlement—the port city of "O'Noa"—still stand today. From "O'Noa" the seafarers expanded outward, until all of the western shores flew their banner. In the north, they found fertile fields protected from the salt of the sea, and an inlet unmarred by looming rocks and dangerous reefs, and they began to build. They did not know their city would become the heart of a great empire. They did not know the glory and sorrow that would surround the city of "Emon".

#### The Iron Rule of Drassig

The rise of human colonies irritated the "elves" of "Syngorn". Forests that had stood for centuries fell under the axes of rash, short-lived beings who sought to exploit, expand, and propagate thoughtlessly. These tensions did not build to war, for long were the memories of the "elves", but humanity remained a thorn in the side of elfkind, chafing at their hard-won efforts to protect their society and threatening to encroach upon their sacred woodlands.

As the first human civilization on this part of the world after the "Calamity", "Emon" gave rise to a handful of self-entitled noble houses who went on to establish civilization in the name of the Lawbearer—but those who wrote the game stacked the deck in their favor. Corruption spread through the upper echelons of "Emon", and power-hungry politicians seized each new and valuable resource that was discovered in their bountiful new kingdom. They turned their citizens against each other, forcing them to fight for scraps while they hoarded the lion's share.

"Emon" was a political war zone, and the greatest warrior of them all was a loudmouthed braggart and cunning oligarch named Warren Drassig. The chaos and mistrust in "Emon" allowed Drassig and his agents to seize power and transform the realm into the Kingdom of Drassig, with Warren himself as its supreme monarch. Drassig was quick to sever any remaining connections with the "elves" of "Syngorn" and make new alliances with the "dwarves" of "Kraghammer", marrying Drassig's autocratic power with the "dwarves'" immense material wealth.

The "elves" were furious, but the ambassador from "Syngorn" to "Emon", an idealistic grandson of the still-living Yenlara, hoped to resolve this diplomatically. Upon arrival, he was apprehended, tortured, and slain. This final act of treachery drove "Syngorn" to arms, and the continent erupted into a terrible, protracted war between Yenlara's kin and Drassig's bloodline known as the "Scattered War".

![King Warren Drassig, with ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn/img/chapter1-drassig.webp#center "King Warren Drassig, with grey hair and beard, wears a golden crown and silver plate armor. He sits atop an ornate, wooden throne. With his arms crossed, he leans on the ruby-inlaid hilt of his long sword, which stands before him, between his legs.")

#### The Scattered War

The Scattered War lasted for thirty-two years, and is recalled in bard-song as the Time of Shrouds. The war spanned the "Cliffkeep Mountains" and parts of the "Verdant Expanse", with the human colonies spread throughout the soon-to-be-warring territories. "King Drassig" encountered little resistance as he conquered each village, town, and city in turn, giving these isolated settlements no way of warning one another of the warlord's advance.

No common warmonger, "Drassig" was a cunning, heartless master of psychological warfare. Weeks in advance of his armies, he seeded spies throughout the land. They traveled swiftly through the secret dwarf-tunnels that crisscrossed the "Cliffkeep Mountains", and infiltrated settlements throughout the region, turning the people of each settlement against their own leaders, eating at them from within, poisoning them against one another. By the time "Drassig's" armies reached their targets, they were already poised to fall. The lights of human towns and elven groves were snuffed out with equal savagery.

Yet, a mere nine years after the war began, King Warren Drassig died.

It happened at "Torthil", an abandoned village in "Gwessar's" heartlands. For years, rumors had grown that "Torthil" was a haven for war refugees. The king and his soldiers fell upon the village with a vengeance, seeking survivors to slaughter. As they regrouped in the town square, "Drassig" stood among them, blade raised, eyes wild, and voice booming, to rally their bloodthirsty spirits. It was at the height of his wicked speech that the first arrow struck, followed shortly by a volley that clouded the sky. After nine years of suffering, Yenlara's wood "elves" and the rebellious "humans" of the scattered colonies had joined forces and formed an alliance against their common enemy.

After Warren "Drassig" fell, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Neminar "Drassig". Neminar shunned the crude, brutal methods of his father, instead finding his interests in more sinister powers. He became known as "Neminar the Black-Fingered," as his forays into necromancy left one arm withered and tainted. Nevertheless, his weaponization of forbidden magic elevated the threat of "Drassig's" war machine. King Neminar, bent on bloody-minded vengeance, led his army back to "Torthil", where the corpses of the elven and human traitors were piled high upon the outer walls. Their pyres ignited the night as the entire city was reduced to rubble. And so the Scattered War continued, unabated by the death of Warren Drassig.

The rule of Neminar marked the darkest days of the war. He introduced tactics and magic that drove his soldiers beyond human limits, leaving their bodies altered and mutated by foul necromancy. Their warped minds craved bloodshed and domination, and their bodies needed no sustenance to fuel their bloodlust. "Drassig's" forces became the perfect weapons of war, their ranks blessed by the divine touch of the Strife Emperor—the first "Betrayer God" to extend his power to mortals beyond the Divine Gate. All the gods soon learned that though they could not walk upon Exandria themselves, they could still grant magic to their faithful.

In the face of such terrible power, the alliance of "humans" and "elves" bolstered their ranks with vengeful orphans and eager heroes of all ancestries who suffered under "Drassig's" tyranny. One such hero who came to be instrumental in the coming conflict was "Zan Tal'Dorei". A human who rose from the harried streets of "Syngorn", Zan quickly showed her mettle as both a warrior and an inspirational leader. Rallying the broken ranks of the resistance, Zan lured Neminar and his lead forces into the "Verdant Expanse".

Neminar's undoing was an arrogant attack upon the "Shifting Keep", a "Syngornian" outpost protected by the slippery magic of the Fey Realm. The illusory fortress vanished, leaving the "Drassig" army without a target and vulnerable to ambush. The forest itself seemed to lend its fury to the weapons of Zan's warriors, and Neminar and his blighted soldiers were crushed in one swift stroke.

Word of Neminar's defeat and death spread like wildfire across "Gwessar", and the banner of "Zan Tal'Dorei's" rebel army became a symbol of hope for all of the oppressed peoples of the realm.

Even so, the last years of fighting were still ahead of them, for the late King Warren Drassig's youngest son still stood to take power, and swore to avenge his family.

#### Battle of the Umbra Hills

"King Trist Drassig", second-born son of the despotic Warren "Drassig", took the throne with unearned confidence. So enamored was he with arrogant visions of victory that he ignored the truth of his tenuous rule: he was neither as brilliant nor as charismatic as his father, his armies were stretched thin, and his people rioted. The rebels, led by the young warrior "Zan Tal'Dorei", won battle after battle, and before long, King Trist found his army backed against the imposing base of the "Cliffkeep Mountains".

In the wake of certain victory, Zan and her rebels, allied with the "elves" of "Syngorn", pursued "Drassig" to this valley, but were met with fiends amidst the ranks of their enemy. King Trist had a secret weapon—through his family's dealings with the Strife Emperor, the spawn of the Betrayers had returned to the world. They spilled into the battlefield like a river of nightmares, and in minutes, the surrounding hills ran dark with blood and ichor, and the bodies of "humans" and demons alike littered the battlefield. Yet, despite all odds, the hero Zan defeated King Trist, ending the "Drassig" bloodline—and with it, the demonic pact the "Drassigs" had made. It is said that the grass and flowers of the "Umbra Hills" grow black and burnt as an echo of this battle, their sap coursing with the fiendish blood that was spilled that day.

### Tal'Dorei Ascendant

Society had all but collapsed once more amidst the "Scattered War". Within the "Verdant Expanse", the triumphant rebels assembled a council of trusted and proven minds, but the people were accustomed to a singular leader, a king. In the hearts of the people, it was not the crown that had failed them, but the bloody-minded family that wore it. The council assented to the will of their people, and nominated the war hero Zan Tal'Dorei to take the throne. She humbly accepted the role, but refused to take the title of king or queen. Her name, she asserted, was Zan. After some debate, she eventually relented to being called Sovereign Tal'Dorei, if such formality was required.

Again in spite of Zan's protestations, the council unanimously agreed the realm should be renamed Tal'Dorei in her honor. Power was divided between the sovereign and the council, both of whom ruled from "Emon". From there, "Emon's" leaders expunged any remnants of "Drassig's" reign from their city, while the allied armies of Tal'Dorei and "Syngorn" did the same throughout the realm. The leading clans of "Kraghammer" pleaded for clemency, claiming they were coerced to serve "Drassig". They spent many years paying reparations and making amends, but the fractured trust between "Gwessar's" peoples took generations to heal.

#### The Icelost Years

Not two years into Sovereign Zan's reign, a cataclysmic evil tested her mettle and the skill of the council. A creature from the Elemental Plane of Ice slunk into the Material Plane through a hitherto unknown rift between the planes. It appeared in a mystical forest of eternal winter known today as the "Frostweald". From its hibernal abode, this elemental spirit spied upon the untested realm of Tal'Dorei and saw an opportunity. The spirit dove back to its extraplanar home and informed its master of a land ripe for conquest. Errevon the Rimelord, a cruel elemental so mighty that he is speculated to have been a scion of the Primordials, one that escaped the gods' wrath in the "Founding", seized this opportunity.

On the next winter solstice, Errevon tore wide the "Frostweald" rift and commanded the endless blizzards of his home plane to ravage the prosperous land around it. Tal'Dorei's southern reaches, thus weakened, were easy pickings for the Algid Legion, a mighty army of frost giants and animate blizzards led by the Rimelord himself. Their relentless advance covered all they touched in snow and death.

Countless brave warriors and civilians alike fell to the invaders' gelid weapons, for they were unprepared for such an onslaught so soon after the "Drassigs'" protracted war. The storm of ice widened year by year, consuming the Tal'Dorei heartland as Errevon claimed all lands that fell beneath the ice as his own. North of the rift, he built a towering citadel of frost, forcing those he conquered to swear fealty in exchange for warmth and liquid water. The Rimelord's tyranny lasted for three long years as the nascent "Council of Tal'Dorei" struggled to convince "Syngorn" and "Kraghammer" to ally for the sake of the realm. This monumental diplomatic mission completed, the combined might of Tal'Dorei, "Syngorn", and "Kraghammer" assaulted Errevon's Citadel and forced the Rimelord back to the rift from whence he came. It was in this time of need that the druidic Ashari people first revealed themselves to the people of Tal'Dorei, and used their unrivaled elemental magic to seal the rift once and for all. The snow began to melt, the fortress toppled into the nearby "Foramere Basin", and the people celebrated their freedom from the oppressive cold. This victory is now celebrated annually throughout Tal'Dorei as the Winter's Crest festival.

#### Thordak, the Cinder King

"Zan Tal'Dorei" passed peacefully after a long and happy rule, and was succeeded by a long line of her descendants. Many generations of peace ensued, and the Tal'Dorei Empire formed as dozens of tiny city-states across the "Dividing Plains" flocked to the stable rule and heroic reputation of Tal'Dorei in the wake of the "Icelost Years".

The adroit statecraft of the "Council of Tal'Dorei" maintained cordial alliances with both "Syngorn" and "Kraghammer", but, despite their best efforts, couldn't keep the "elves" and "dwarves" from regressing to hostility over ancient quarrels. In the time of Sovereign Odellan Tal'Dorei, word of a shadow in the south came to the ears of the council. Contact with numerous outlying townships at the edges of the empire halted abruptly, and traders that made circuits from "Emon" to the "Rifenmist Peninsula" in the south vanished without a trace. The council was slow to act in defense of territories that routinely flaunted imperial law, but were finally driven to action when allied villages south of the "Verdant Expanse" begged for protection against a "nightmare of fire and malice." The dour Sovereign Odellan blocked the council's relief efforts, claiming the economic cost of sending a regiment that far south to outsider communities was a misuse of resources, especially without proof of a threat. It wasn't until two years later, when reports of a powerful red dragon reached the ears of the sovereign, that the "Council of Tal'Dorei" was able to act.

By then, much of the "Mornset Countryside" had been reduced to ash by a self-obsessed and power-hungry red dragon named "Thordak", who preferred the self-styled moniker of "the Cinder King." According to "Cobalt Soul" records from the Temple of the Mentor in the lands of "Marquet", the "Cinder King" was presumed dead nearly two hundred years prior, killed by the brass dragon Devo'ssa—yet it could not be denied that "Thordak" survived, and that he sought new peoples to enslave, ones with fewer defenses.

The mighty armies of Tal'Dorei marched finally south, but morale was low. They marched toward fiery, painful death, and soldiers grumbled of a heartless sovereign who luxuriated in his castle in "Emon" while his people put their lives on the line for the realm. They finally clashed with "Thordak" and his mercenary armies south of the "Stormcrest Mountains", but the forces of Tal'Dorei were soon forced into a panicked, disorganized retreat as the rocky, exposed terrain worked to the advantage of their airborne foe.

The valiant soldiers of Tal'Dorei would surely have been brought to utter ruin were it not for the heroic intervention of a band of young—yet able—adventurers. Led by "Arcanist Allura Vysoren", who sits today upon the "Tal'Dorei Council", they cornered the "Cinder King" alone and defeated him—though his power was so great that they could not manage to kill the dragon outright. Instead, "Allura" and her companions used powerful magic to imprison "Thordak" within the Elemental Plane of Fire forever. The Fire Ashari of distant "Issylra" vowed to watch over "Thordak's" prison until age could consume even him.

#### The Chroma Conclave

Forever lasted a mere sixteen years. In that time, life returned to mundane quarrels over the price of bread and taxes. During this time of quietude, an old and unexpected ally of "Thordak's", a green dragon called Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, found "Thordak" and conspired to release him from his prison so he could conquer the land that had once rebuked him. Raishan formed a plan and forged an unprecedented alliance with three other power-hungry chromatic dragons: Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, Brimscythe the Iron Storm, and Vorugal the Frigid Doom.

After infiltrating the Fire Ashari of Pyrah for nearly five years, Raishan finally unlocked the seal between the planes that bound "Thordak" and set him free. "Thordak's" physical body was warped by the fiery energies of his prison. Now stronger than ever, he rallied his draconic allies, the Chroma Conclave, to destroy or conquer Tal'Dorei as they saw fit—starting with a retributive assault of catastrophic proportions on "Emon". Nearly three centuries of Tal'Dorei rule in the realm ended under the rule of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II, his life cut short when much of "Emon" was reduced to rubble.

The attack not only killed the Sovereign Uriel, but also scattered the "Council of Tal'Dorei", throwing the realm into chaos. The remnants of the civilized lands were divided up and taken as trophies by the Conclave, while the capital "Emon" was ruled by the "Cinder King" himself, with Raishan secretly manipulating the course of his rule from the shadows.

The "Alabaster Lyceum" need hardly introduce the heroes of this story. One by one, the members of the Conclave fell to the might and cleverness of a band of misfit warriors known as Vox Machina, their might bolstered by a number of the lost "Vestiges of Divergence", artifacts of incalculable power forged amidst the chaos of the "Calamity". After many adventures, these heroes gathered their allies and stormed the capital of "Emon", slaying "Thordak the Cinder King" and freeing its people. Upon discovering the machinations of the real mastermind, Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, with whom Vox Machina had held a tenuous alliance, they gave chase and finally slew this last standing member of the Chroma Conclave, ending their reign over the land and restoring rule once more to the "Council of Tal'Dorei".

### A Fledgling Republic

The final act of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II's life was to abdicate the throne and end the line of sovereigns—permanently. To analyze the historic Last Sovereign's final acts is the duty of biographers, not chroniclers, yet it can readily be surmised that he saw flaws inherent to his station. Uriel was the son of Odellan Tal'Dorei, the sovereign who singlehandedly prevented the council from swiftly handling the "Cinder King" when first he rose in the wilderness south of the empire.

How could the Last Sovereign not feel that it was his office's immense power to overrule the council that ultimately cost thousands of loyal citizens their lives? How could he not compare the singular power of the sovereign to the abuses of power committed by "King Drassig" in ancient times?

Regardless of his private feelings, Uriel II's last act as sovereign transformed his family's imperial dynasty into the Republic of Tal'Dorei. "Zan Tal'Dorei" was reluctant to accept the singular role of rulership at the dawning of the nation, an ideal she had to compromise upon to ensure stability for her fledgling nation. Uriel's relinquishment of power is seen today as a fulfillment of that ideal. It will be the duty of future historians to judge if his decision stood the test of time.

#### The Time of Regrowth

The "Tal'Dorei Council" has guided the fate of the nation since Vox Machina slew the "Cinder King". For most of the past two decades, the goal of the council has been to rebuild that which was lost—and to assure far-flung territories that the nascent republic is just as stable as the empire ever was.

Recovery has been slow in both Tal'Dorei's heartland and its most distant reaches. Even though cities like "Kymal" and "Stilben" were not direct targets of the dragons' rampage, the age of unrest that followed made these small cities easy targets for ransacking by roving bandits and corrupt magistrates alike. Even today, outlying settlements are slow to trust the good intentions of the "Tal'Dorei Council".

Major cities like "Westruun" and "Emon" have been the greatest beneficiaries of the Time of Regrowth, for even though they suffered the worst of the "Conclave's" destruction, the dragons also kept their lairs close by, allowing vast amounts of plundered wealth from their treasure hoards to flow rapidly back into these cities' coffers. Over the last twenty years, these cities have hired legions of arcanists to magically restore much of what was lost.

However, perhaps the one city that can say it directly benefited from the "Chroma Conclave's" reign of chaos is "Whitestone", a formerly independent city-state that is now a member of the republic. "Whitestone" took in countless refugees from "Emon" after the "Conclave's" initial attack, and countless more in the aftermath. Sequestered in Tal'Dorei's cold northeastern reaches, "Whitestone" is an isolated city, but it has rapidly become a powerhouse of political, cultural, artistic, and economic influence—to the chagrin of some traditionalists in "Emon".

#### Apotheosis Thwarted

The world was troubled by a disturbance in "Issylra" a year after the "Chroma Conclave's" defeat, as a lich attempted to achieve godhood and crush the Dawn City of Vasselheim in one fell swoop. His success would have meant catastrophe for the Material Plane, leaving him the sole god on this side of the world's impenetrable Divine Gate. However, beyond hearing news of Vox Machina's involvement in this conflict, few in Tal'Dorei were concerned by rumblings on the other side of the world.

Though the lich's defeat confined him to a remote demiplane, there is no way to strip him of his stolen divinity. Occult worshipers yet scurry throughout Tal'Dorei's darkest corners, seeking the favor of a lich-god known as The Whispered One.

#### Seeds of Peril

A generation has passed in relative peace. Yet all who have studied history know that each age's conflict sows the seeds of the next. The Republic of Tal'Dorei has proven it can prosper in peacetime, but it has yet to be tested by the pressures of war or a supernatural cataclysm.

After two decades of expensive reconstruction and princely investments in [skyship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) moorings, the Republic of Tal'Dorei is deeply indebted to arcanists across the land. Chief among them is the "League of Miracles", a consortium of thaumaturgists who have claimed untold fortunes from reconstruction bounties all over the country.

The simple fact is that the cost of rebuilding Tal'Dorei was far more than the council or local leaders could afford to pay. Far be it from the "Alabaster Lyceum" to cast aspersions on so beneficial an organization, but there are fears among the Tal'Dorei people that the league has already begun to collect on what they are owed in forms other than gold, as more and more league mages receive preferential treatment from local margraves and even members of the "Tal'Dorei Council" itself.

Beyond "Emon", the landscape of Tal'Dorei has been forever scarred by the presence of the "Conclave", especially the "Cinder King". His hellfire left marks on the land that will never heal—magical wounds that bleed fire and ooze chaotic magic. Smaller cities beyond the reach of the council have begun to succumb to sinister influences. Demons and devils crawl into the world, summoned by occult powers answering fell voices from beyond the Divine Gate. The "Betrayer Gods" sense weakness within the world. The entropic fury of the Chained Oblivion churns beneath "Gatshadow". The [lost blade of Neminar the Black-Fingered](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/graztchar-the-decadent-end-tdcsr.md) calls from the "Umbra Hills" for a new master. The Cloaked Serpent raises armies south of "Syngorn". Cults of the now-divine Whispered One spread like poison through the veins of Tal'Dorei's cities.

Yet despite these threats, the legendary heroes of Vox Machina have largely set down their blades, guns, and spells and taken up the mantle of leadership. More than twenty years have passed since their greatest adventures, and though the surviving members of Vox Machina are still canny rulers and cunning warriors, the "Tal'Dorei Council" can no longer rely upon their skills as readily as they once did. Rumors of the heroes' permanent retirement swirl, inspiring fear and nostalgic sorrow in many of the people—but adventurers across the land see this as an opportunity to rise to the level of Vox Machina and beyond.

Tal'Dorei needs heroes—and this time, Vox Machina alone will not be enough.

## Running a Tal'Dorei Campaign

Tal'Dorei is more than just its history; do not treat this book as an encyclopedia, nor as shackles that bind you to portray its characters and environments with perfect fidelity. As you read this manual, consider why you want to run an RPG campaign set in Tal'Dorei, and in the larger world of Exandria. What about *Critical Role* inspires you as a Game Master? You might cherish the bonds of family and love between its many heroic characters. Perhaps you are drawn to the various factions that vie for power over Tal'Dorei's peoples. Or perhaps it's the way that evils from Exandria's mythic past inevitably rear their ugly heads, always when circumstances are already at their most dire, that most captures your attention.

No matter the initial spark that led you here, hold tight to it as you read, and search for ways to feed your personal flame of imagination. And when you are done, create. Create boldly, using these words as a launching point for your own tales.

This section is for Game Masters' eyes only, though GMs are welcome to share tidbits with their players to set the stage for the campaign, or to inspire them to create characters that will dovetail with the GM's story ideas.

### Secrets of Tal'Dorei

The world of Exandria is steeped in familiar fantasy themes, with all the "elves", "dwarves", and wizards you might expect from a fantasy roleplaying game. But it also holds secrets that will challenge your expectations, and you may enjoy putting your own twists on these great mysteries of the world. Each of these secrets can form the backbone of an entire campaign, or can serve as flavor to create the impression of a world that is larger than just the player characters' story.

#### All-Powerful, Imprisoned Gods

Tal'Dorei was nearly destroyed when the gods fought one another in the "Calamity". Now, the "Betrayer Gods" are sealed in otherworldly prison planes, and the victorious "Prime Deities" live in self-imposed exile. An unbreakable barrier stands between the mortal and immortal realms. At best, a deity can grant their most skilled devotees a small measure of divine power to enact their will upon Exandria.

However, there are a number of cults who yearn to circumvent this barrier and summon their dark patron onto the Material Plane. Others still seek to unravel the forgotten rites of ascension, just as the Matron of Ravens did in ancient times—just as The Whispered One did in living memory. What would happen if an omnipotent deity somehow managed to arise on the mortal side of the Divine Gate? Or even simply managed to fool the gods into thinking they had done so? Would the gods of good be forced to unleash their powers as one to break the Gate, unleashing another "Calamity" upon the world?

#### Dawn of a Republic

It was the dying decree of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II that the continent-spanning Tal'Dorei Empire be reborn as the Republic of Tal'Dorei. No more would a sovereign rule the myriad peoples of this land, but instead the wise "Council of Tal'Dorei" would enact the will of the people and protect them from the dangers of the world. But things don't always go according to plan. The nascent Republic of Tal'Dorei is suffering growing pains, and unless some heroes are able to help, the realm may fall into anarchy and chaos.

While fantasy politics isn't every gamer's cup of tea, the struggles of the fledgling republic can serve several purposes. Players looking for fantasy intrigue can meddle in the internal politics of the city of "Emon" and root out corruption within the council, which may have been planted by any number of this land's power-hungry factions, from the invasive crime syndicate known as the "Myriad" to the shadowy mages within the "Arcana Pansophical" who splintered off into a new schismatic faction, the "League of Miracles".

Game Masters can also use political elements to flavor or provide a backdrop for their otherwise action-focused games. On a smaller scale, corrupt margraves may hire bandits to pillage their own villages, requiring heroes to step in. On a broader scale, a threat to the stability of the Republic of Tal'Dorei itself may force the characters to stop a megalomaniac bent on conquering the republic from within.

#### Criminal Shadow War

A criminal syndicate known as the "Clasp" has lurked in Tal'Dorei's underworld since the foundation of the old Tal'Dorei Empire. It's almost become a cliché, for people across the land know the "Clasp" as the stereotypical face of organized crime. Novels romanticizing their allure have been adapted into stage plays and bard-song in all corners of the republic.

And perhaps the "Clasp" has bought its own good publicity. After the "Cinder King's" famous conquest of "Emon" some twenty years ago, it was the "Clasp" that saved countless innocent people and led them to safety through their extensive network of smuggling tunnels beneath the city. It was the organized action of criminals, just as much as Vox Machina's heroic power, which saved Tal'Dorei—and the "Tal'Dorei Council" knows it. The "Clasp" has gone mainstream.

However, the "Clasp" is under threat from the "Myriad", another criminal syndicate from the nearby continent of "Wildemount". The "Myriad" sees Tal'Dorei's slow legitimization of the "Clasp" as an opportunity to seize power in the nation's criminal underground. Violence is on the rise in Tal'Dorei's cities as the "Myriad" uses local gangs as pawns in their bid to dethrone the "Clasp".

#### A Land Thrice-Destroyed

First there was the "Calamity", and the palaces of the gods were devoured by the earth. Then came the wars of "Drassig", and his defeat at the hands of "Zan Tal'Dorei". And then came "Thordak". The "Cinder King" and the "Chroma Conclave" shook the very foundations of Tal'Dorei. "Thordak" "merely" reduced the city of "Emon" to slag, but through fear, panic, and malice, the flames of destruction were spread across the continent by mortal hands. Today, a generation after the dawning of the Republic of Tal'Dorei, the ruins of three civilizations lie buried beneath your feet, and some secrets long to be unearthed.

#### Mother of Invention

[Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md)—[Percy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md), to his friends—wanted to take the secrets of his inventions to his grave, especially the deadly power of his firearms. Unfortunately, because of his now-deceased archenemy Anna Ripley, the secret of gunpowder has begun to spread across Tal'Dorei. Now, isolated groups of tinkerers, both noble and unscrupulous are working to develop new technologies from [Percival's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md) research, and other black powder technologies from "Marquet". Some of these modern marvels will no doubt help the people of Exandria—but others, if placed in the wrong hands, are sure to enable the deaths of thousands.

Renaissance technologies, especially firearms, are not common in Tal'Dorei. If you want to keep your fantasy purely medieval, it's a simple matter to ignore the tinkerers, gunsmiths, and budding industrialists scattered across the continent.

#### Uncharted Territory

The corners of Tal'Dorei's maps are not all filled in. North of the "Cliffkeep Mountains", the trackless "Neverfields" push up against the northern edge of the map. South of the "Verdant Expanse" is the "Rifenmist Peninsula", where vast jungles and the brutal forces of the "Iron Authority" prevent any explorer from filling in the map's southern tips.

To help you create stories that feel at home in Tal'Dorei, "chapter 3" of this book contains a number of story hooks throughout its description of Tal'Dorei's landscape and settlements. See ""Creating Adventures"" for more information on how to turn these plot seeds into full adventures that you can run for your gaming group.

While this book gives insight to one version of Exandria, its lore exists to serve you, not the other way around. Your campaign is your own creation—if you delight in adhering to *Critical Role* canon and delving into its lore, then by all means, dig deeper! If you like subverting expectations, revealing that things believed to be true were nothing but myth and rumor all along, tell that story! And, if you love characters and places from *Critical Role*, but want your stories to go to brand-new lands of your own creation, take inspiration from this book and steer your campaign in whatever direction you see fit. Never forget that you are the creator of your own version of Tal'Dorei. No matter who is playing at your table, even if it's Matthew Mercer himself, no one can tell you that your vision of the world is inaccurate—because it's yours now.

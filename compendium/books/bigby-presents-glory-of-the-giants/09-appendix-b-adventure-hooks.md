# Appendix B: Adventure Hooks
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants, p. 192* 

This book is full of seeds you can use to craft adventures involving giants and the realms they inhabit. Tables (and text) in chapters "2", "3", and "4" present giants as patrons, rivals, or adversaries, or suggest reasons why characters might venture to locations constructed or occupied by giants. The adventure hooks are spread throughout these three chapters because they're intended to complement the information presented in each chapter. For example, if you get excited as you're reading about the giant pantheon and decide you want to build an adventure that features these gods, a table is right there to spark your imagination.

If you're unsure where to start, you can use the Adventure Hooks table here to help you decide.

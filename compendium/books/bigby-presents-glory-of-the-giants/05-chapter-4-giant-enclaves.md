This chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, presents giant enclaves—locations created by giants, controlled by them, or otherwise stemming from giants and their magic. Each section contains a map of the giant enclave, a description of the enclave's features and wondrous properties, and adventure ideas.

The chapter includes the following giant enclaves:

- "Annam's Cradle"  
- "Ashen Grotto"  
- "Dreamer's Reach"  
- "Endless Rockslide"  
- "Forest Crystal"  
- "Forsaken Deep"  
- "Gale's Eye Tower"  
- "Grolantor's Larder"  
- "Hiatea's Hearth"  
- "Horizon's Edge"  
- "Howling Iceberg"  
- "Karontor's Hold"  
- "Misty Vale"  
- "Runic Circle"  
- "Singing Sands"  
- "Star Forge"  
- "Thundering Observatory"  
- "Worldroot Sapling"

## Using Enclaves

Each of the locations in this chapter is a blank slate; you can decide who lives there, what they want, and how they interact with visitors. Each location includes a selection of adventure hooks that might attract characters to the enclave or give them a reason to draw on its magic. The adventure hooks also suggest specific creatures or encounter tables appearing in the ""Encounters"" section in "chapter 3". And several of these hooks point to other enclaves, creating paths to string locations together into larger adventures.

When developing these enclaves into adventure sites, let your imagination run wild. Mix and match different encounter tables to see what can arise. Consider how randomly determining the attitude of the creatures generated can shift the tone of a story. If a hostile giant is the driving force behind an adventure seed, how does the adventure change if that giant is indifferent or even friendly to the characters?

### Giant Enclave General Features

Locations built, repurposed, or furnished by giants have a grand scale. A giant's castle contains massive thrones, dining tables that could serve as the foundation for a human's home, and cutlery a human army could use as weapons. As a general rule, multiply each dimension of a space or object by three to estimate its giant-sized version, or by four if it's made by cloud or storm giants. Giant-sized locations have the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Comfortable ceilings for giants must exceed 20 feet at minimum. Most ceilings are 30 feet high, with luxurious or impressive construction pushing their height to 60 feet or more.  
- **Doors.** Door handles are typically 10 to 12 feet off the floor (or half the height of the giants who built them). Large or smaller creatures must reach the handle to unlatch it. Opening a door typically requires one character to operate the latch and another to wrestle the door open. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. (Alternatively, you can set the DC to 6 + the Strength modifier of the giants who built the door.) On a failed check, the door doesn't open.  
- **Oversized Furnishing and Objects.** Furnishings and other items in a location made for Huge giants are typically three times the size of human-sized equivalents and roughly twenty-seven times the weight. Medium and smaller creatures can clamber over or scuttle under giant-sized furniture, treating it as "difficult terrain". Such creatures can move normally beneath particularly hefty pieces of giant furniture, such as a 12-foot-tall dining table.  
- **Stairs.** Giant-made steps range from 1½ to 3 feet high. Large and smaller creatures treat such staircases as difficult terrain. Ladders made for giants, with rungs spaced 3 feet apart, can also be treated as difficult terrain for creatures smaller than Huge.  

## Annam's Cradle

Giants from an ancient empire created an empowered form of the life rune that channeled Annam the All-Father's raw creative might. The giants sought to create their own world as he once did, and invoked the rune in an immense cavern deep underground, which they named Annam's Cradle. The result was a permanent rift in the fabric of reality leading to the Positive Plane—the source from which radiant energy flows throughout the multiverse to fuel light and life.

This rift, an incandescent slash in the cavern's "sky," is known as the Radiant Sun. It floods the vast cavern with light and unchecked life. Fed by this sun, the cavern is a sprawling tropical jungle ecosystem where massive creatures thrive.

### Annam's Cradle Features

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.1: Annam's Cradle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/047-map-4-01-annams-cradle.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/048-map-4-01-annams-cradle-player.webp#gallery)

The Radiant Sun fluctuates in size and intensity to approximate a cycle of day and night. During the day, the rift sheds bright light that counts as sunlight, raising the temperature in the jungle to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. At night, the light fades to dim light and doesn't count as sunlight. The cavern's ceiling is a quarter of a mile high and has the appearance of a strangely rough-looking blue sky. The microclimate within the cavern features cloudy and rainy weather in addition to sunshine.

Map 4.1 depicts a region of Annam's Cradle with the following features:

- **Jungle.** Nourished by the light of the Radiant Sun and persistent rainfall, this part of the cavern is covered in lush rain forest. The jungle is rife with natural hazards, including "razorvine" (explained in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").  
- **Ruins.** Ancient structures built by giants lie in ruins, partially swallowed by the verdant jungle.  
- **Villages.** Settlements populated by giants, duergar, deep gnomes, and other creatures dot the cavern.  
- **Waterfall.** A mighty river plummets down a cliff face beneath the Radiant Sun. The waterfall gleams with inner light infused by the sun, and the water flows throughout the rest of the cavern in lesser rivers and streams. The waterfall sheds dim light for 30 feet. Water downriver of the falls sheds dim light for 5 feet.  

### Annam's Cradle Magic

The Radiant Sun imbues Annam's Cradle with the following properties:

- **Abundance of Life.** Creatures other than Constructs or Undead who finish a long rest within Annam's Cradle regain all expended Hit Dice and remove 2 levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).  
- **Infused Water.** Water taken from the waterfall retains the imbued positive energy for 24 hours, during which time the water sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that isn't a Construct or an Undead that drinks the water gains `2d10` "temporary hit points" and the benefits of a [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell. A creature that gains these benefits can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.  
- **Planar Rift.** The Radiant Sun is a permanent, one-way portal from the Positive Plane.  

### Annam's Cradle Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Annam's Cradle or to give them missions to pursue within the cavern.

#### Dreams in Stone

A great pillar of rock reaching to the cavern's ceiling is the [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) body of a primordial giant. The figure's arm stretches up, breaching the cavern ceiling, and its fingers emerge on the surface above as "Dreamer's Reach" (in this chapter). The sleeping primordial's nightmares might take the form of creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" or the "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" in "chapter 3", and they crawl down the petrified form to terrorize the inhabitants of the cavern below. Or they could climb to the surface at Dreamer's Reach, leading the characters into Annam's Cradle to find their source.

The nightmares might be a once-in-a-lifetime disaster, making the adventure a matter of waiting them out and defending against the creatures that terrorize the area. Alternatively, they might recur regularly, leading characters to seek a way to end the cycle by soothing the slumbering titan's nightmares, which might require climbing its mountainous form and carving the Giant rune for "friend" into its forehead.

#### Little Fluffy Lost

A distraught giant child lost their pet and begs for help retrieving it before it comes to harm. The child leads the characters into the jungle, where they find a menacing [allosaurus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/allosaurus.md). Before any hostilities erupt, the child delightedly shouts, "Fluffy!" The allosaurus wags its tail and rolls on its back for belly rubs. However, creatures from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" in "chapter 3" have been hunting the dinosaur and close in for the kill.

#### Stricken Crown

A cursed ruler's failing health can be cured only by water taken from the cavern's central waterfall. But [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) of especially immense stature led by a [hill giant avalancher](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant-avalancher-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") venerate and guzzle the waters. They violently defend the waterfall with beasts of war from the "Megafauna World Encounters" or "Dinosaur World Encounters table" in "chapter 3".

## Ashen Grotto

The Ashen Grotto is a burial ground for giants. Since it was first established—in a long-ago age when a great empire of giants stretched across the world—giants of all kinds have brought their dead to be interred within this nexus of giants' magic.

Many giants hold strong beliefs and taboos about the grotto. Some might put aside a deadly enmity with their rivals to defend it against intruders. Others might refuse to enter for any reason other than during funerary rites to inter a family member's remains. Remains laid to rest within the grotto remain peaceful, and the power of the cave is anathema to Undead.

### Ashen Grotto Features

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.2: Ashen Grotto](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/049-map-4-02-ashen-grotto.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/050-map-4-02-ashen-grotto-player.webp#gallery)

The walls of this seaside cave of white limestone are reinforced with masonry and inscribed with verses extolling the ordning and reverence for one's ancestors. Most of the cave is above the sea's reach.

Map 4.2 depicts the Ashen Grotto's chambers and burial sites, including the following features:

- **Caskets.** Stone and crystal caskets house the remains of stone giants.  
- **Coral Pool.** The bottom of a pool fed by an inlet from the sea is carpeted with storm giant bones covered in coral.  
- **Frozen Skeletons.** Frost giant skeletons lie or sit propped, wearing ancient armor covered in lasting rime.  
- **Hidden Tomb.** A secret door hides a repository of cloud giant dust.  
- **Ossuary Pits.** Hill giant remains are heaped in pits where scavengers thrive.  
- **Urns.** Brass and iron urns contain fire giant ashes.  

Scattered among all these urns, caskets, and burial niches are the remains of other creatures who were loyal allies or loved ones of giants long gone, including creatures of the Giant type such as ettins and ogres, and even some Humanoids and other non-Giants.

### Ashen Grotto Magic

The Ashen Grotto's magic reinforces the ordning specifically, and the natural, harmonious order of things in general. It can be used to break curses and ease afflictions, and to find insight into that which must be returned to its rightful course. The site is consecrated ground with the following properties:

- **Bane of Undead.** Dead creatures can't become Undead in the grotto. An Undead that enters the grotto for the first time during a turn or that starts its turn there takes 22 (`5d8`) radiant damage. An Undead reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and can't be returned to its undead state by any means short of divine intervention.  
- **Ordning's Path.** A creature who spends 8 hours meditating in the grotto on the nature of order and the rightful course of history can cast one of the following spells at the end of that time (no additional casting time or spell components required): [legend lore](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/legend-lore.md), [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md), or [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) (cast at 9th level). The spellcasting ability for the spell is the creature's choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. After casting the spell, the creature gains 2 levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).  

### Ashen Grotto Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Ashen Grotto or to give them missions to pursue within the cave.

#### Greedy Usurpers

Giants who wish to inter their dead in the Ashen Grotto ask the characters to help them remove a rival faction claiming it for themselves. The friendly giants respect the grotto's traditions and refuse to shed another giant's blood within, but the rivals no longer hold to tradition and seek to plunder the grotto's treasures and power. Use your choice of "Giantkind Encounters tables" in "chapter 3" for the rivals.

#### Key to the Past

A token in one of the most ancient burials is inscribed with the last surviving copy of a key rune. In the ages since its creation, the rune has become corrupted. It still functions, but it creates tears in the planar fabric. Creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") defend the rune. If this rune is inscribed in the "Runic Circle", it opens a gateway to "Horizon's Edge" (both in this chapter).

#### Missing Pieces

A [storm giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) asks the characters to retrieve an ancestor's bone from the Coral Pool, since she is forbidden to enter the grotto. She promises them a [javelin of lightning](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/javelin-of-lightning.md) if they retrieve the bone, which she intends to use to make a more powerful item. A [behir](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/behir.md) agent of a rival storm giant and creatures from the "Storm Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") try to steal the bone first.

#### Tide of Death

Fleeing from a horde comprising hundreds of [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (as well as creatures from the "Death Giant Encounters" or "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" in "chapter 3"), villagers took sanctuary in the grotto but are now trapped and running out of supplies. Adventurers must disperse the horde by killing the [death giant shrouded one](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/death-giant-shrouded-one-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") who created it or clear a path for the villagers to escape.

## Dreamer's Reach

Dreamer's Reach is steeped in dreams. Five stone monoliths stand atop a low mound of earth, reaching toward the sky. The monoliths are the fingers of a petrified, primordial being of earth and stone. This being strove to reach the surface—what it believed to be the world of dreams—and almost succeeded: its fingers reached into the air, but then the being fell into perpetual slumber. Now the echoes of its dreams whisper to any who sleep in the vicinity.

Stone giants were the first to discover the site and its magical properties, and they built shelters in and around the mound. Dreamer's Reach draws stone giant pilgrims who seek the place for its magic, but other creatures often use the shelters for their own purposes.

### Dreamer's Reach Features

![Map 4.3: Dreamer's Reach](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/051-map-4-03-dreamers-reach.webp#center)

The mound around the stone fingers has been smoothed to a circular plateau. Giant-sized shelters are carved into the sides of the plateau, and several free-standing structures made of fitted stones surround the mound. Map 4.3 depicts Dreamer's Reach, including the following features:

- **Monoliths.** Four of the monoliths—the fingers of the primordial's outstretched hand—are arranged in an arc and stand about 30 feet tall. The fifth (the thumb) is set apart from the inner curve of the fingers and stands about 15 feet tall. Spiraling carvings and Giant runes adorn all five monoliths.  
- **Shelters.** The shelters are spacious for Small or Medium creatures, but they are cozy for the stone giants who built them, with just enough room for two Huge creatures to lie down side by side.  

### Dreamer's Reach Magic

A creature who falls asleep or uses a feature such as an elf's Trance trait at Dreamer's Reach can call upon the magic of the place while sleeping, activating one of the following properties:

- **Dreamer's Call.** The creature casts the [dream](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dream.md) spell as it sleeps, requiring no additional casting time, action, or spell components. The caster must be the spell's messenger. When the spell ends, the recipient of the spell is immune to this property for 24 hours.  
- **Dreaming Intuition.** The creature casts either the [commune](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune.md) or the [divination](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md) spell as it sleeps, requiring no additional casting time, action, or spell components. The spells tap into a collective reservoir of dreams, and the answers come as dream imagery. This reservoir can answer the caster's questions if the subject has ever been dreamed of.  

A creature who uses one of these properties can't use either one again for 24 hours. On waking, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or have the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition for 24 hours. A creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way refuses to leave Dreamer's Reach and wants to use one of the site's properties the next time the creature sleeps. Each time a creature succeeds on or fails this saving throw, the save DC permanently increases by 1 for that creature.

### Dreamer's Reach Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Dreamer's Reach or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Dreaming Key

A [cloud giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md) has taken control of Dreamer's Reach, searching for the answer to a riddle that leads to the "Misty Vale" (in this chapter). The giant has hired and tricked creatures from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") to defend the site.

#### Plague of Nightmares

Many people suffer repeating, terrible dreams every night. A [coven of night hags](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) uses dozens of people at Dreamer's Reach as channels to send the nightmares. The hags use creatures from the "Hill Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") as bodyguards.

#### Royal Nightmare

A monarch is locked in nightmare-filled slumber that magic has failed to end. Characters must use Dreamer's Reach to enter the sleeper's nightmares and end them from within. Dream entities oppose the effort, taking the forms of creatures from the dreamer's life and from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters" and "Giant Necropolis Encounters" tables in "chapter 3".

#### Starry Beacon

A character who rests at Dreamer's Reach dreams of a brilliant star falling from the sky. Images of the dream persist upon waking and lead the character to a distinctive mountain. There, the character can use the "Star Forge" (in this chapter) to create a sentient magic item if they gather the proper materials and defeat creatures from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") at the forge.

#### Wakeup Call

A missing patrol's trail leads to Dreamer's Reach. The primordial's dreams charmed the patrol to join a group of [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) who seek omens from the dream world. The patrol refuses to leave, and the giants and creatures from the "Stone Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") fight to keep the patrol here if necessary.

## Endless Rockslide

A perpetual cascade of stone and earth, from pebbles to boulders, begins near the peak of a mountain and tumbles down the slope before disappearing into a crevice. This Endless Rockslide originates from the Elemental Plane of Earth, emerging from a planar portal near the mountain peak and plunging through a second portal deep in the crevice, ending in a different area of the Plane of Earth.

Giants of an ancient civilization sought to harvest the rockslide's magic and endless mineral resources. To aid their work, they carved walkways around the rockslide and built stone bridges spanning the fissure it pours into. The Giant runes these folk carved into the bridges still glimmer with crystalline light as they harness elemental earth magic.

### Endless Rockslide Features

![Map 4.4: Endless Rockslide](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/052-map-4-04-endless-rockslide.webp#center)

The Endless Rockslide plunges down the mountainside with tremendous force and thunderous sound. Creatures within 100 feet of the earth slide make ability checks that require hearing with disadvantage. A creature that starts its turn in the rockslide must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature descends 200 feet and takes 33 (`6d10`) bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and can grab a stable handhold within reach to avoid descending. After descending 1,000 feet from the rockslide's origin, the creature passes through a permanent portal to the Plane of Earth. A creature with a burrow speed can use that speed to move in the slide, has advantage on the saving throw, and takes half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful save. A creature with the Earth Glide trait automatically succeeds on the saving throw. The source of the slide is also a permanent portal to the Plane of Earth.

Map 4.4 shows the following features surrounding the Endless Rockslide:

- **Bridges and Walkways.** Bridges carved with Binding Runes (see below) span the chasm, and walkways allow access around the rockslide. A crane and winch with buckets and sieves, installed in recent times, allow workers to gather minerals from the slide.  
- **Chambers.** Giant-sized chambers are carved into the rock near the falls, including a workshop that holds tools for working metal, stone, and gems.  

### Endless Rockslide Magic

The Endless Rockslide has the following properties:

- **Binding Runes.** A creature touching one of the runes on the bridge can attempt to activate it with 1 minute of concentration and a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a failed check, the creature takes 22 (`4d10`) force damage, as the bound elemental power releases explosively. On a successful check, the rune conjures an [earth elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) that remains for 1 hour and obeys the creature. Once a creature has used this property to cast the spell, that creature can't use this property of any binding rune again until it finishes a long rest.  
- **Endless Resources.** The Endless Rockslide is an inexhaustible source of minerals. A creature who spends 8 hours using appropriate tools to gather materials from the slide acquires `2d6 × 50` gp worth of useful or valuable minerals.  

### Endless Rockslide Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Endless Rockslide or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Constructive Endeavors

Runes harnessing the elemental power of the Endless Rockslide hold the key to a [mage's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) research. The mage offers a [manual of golems (clay)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/manual-of-clay-golems.md) in exchange for help in overcoming guardians from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" (see "chapter 3").

#### Dangerous Beauty

Stone giant artisans find inspiration in the Endless Rockslide and create beautiful works from its material, but a [fomorian warlock of the dark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fomorian-warlock-of-the-dark-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") curses the crafts to bring misfortune. The stone giants ask the characters to find the fomorian and end the curse before they're overwhelmed with creatures drawn from the "Fomorian Encounters" and "Giant Kin Encounters" tables in "chapter 3".

#### Greatest Game

A [frost giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) loves to hunt dangerous creatures. She intends to divert the Endless Rockslide and use its force to break open a rock formation sealing off "Annam's Cradle" (in this chapter). Opening the path frees beasts from the "Megafauna World Encounters table" (see "chapter 3"), which then threaten a settlement of deep gnomes and duergar.

#### Hungry Earth

Hungry creatures from the "Elemental Earth Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") swarm from the Endless Rockslide, driving out the fire giants working there. The giants offer a bounty of metal craft and gems in exchange for help retaking the site.

#### Rival Elements

A [djinni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) assaults the Endless Rockslide to disrupt the plans of her [dao](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/dao.md) rival. Each genie asks the characters to side against the other. The characters face threats from the "Elemental Earth Encounters" or "Elemental Air Encounters table" in "chapter 3" as appropriate.

## Forest Crystal

A great blue crystal juts from the moss of a forest glade and pulses with soft light. The plants of the surrounding wood grow to fantastic proportions. Regardless of local weather, the glade and its surrounding forest always thrive, offering shelter and bounty to the creatures who dwell there. But this verdant region hides a dark secret.

A forgotten empire of giants used a network of crystals, including the one at the forest's heart, to shape the land to their needs. The crystals tap into the magic of the Feywild, drawing the natural energy of that realm to overlay the material landscape around them. Though the forest is real for all practical purposes, it is a magical illusion concealing a region of sinister corruption.

### Forest Crystal Features

![Map 4.5: Forest Crystal](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/053-map-4-05-forest-crystal.webp#center)

Map 4.5 depicts the forest crystal and its surrounding glade, including the following features:

- **Crystal.** The 80-foot-tall, 50-foot-wide crystal sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Shades of blue swirl within the crystal, occasionally resolving into murky images of giants' faces or Giant runes. The crystal radiates powerful but fluctuating magic.  
- **Plants.** The plants around the crystal grow quite large and can move on their own as if sapient—often uprooting themselves to wander into the forest, keeping the glade relatively free of undergrowth.  
- **Tree Dwellings.** Wooden huts with slate or thatched roofs perch in some of the larger trees around the edges of the glade.  

### Forest Crystal Magic

The Forest Crystal extends a powerful magical shroud covering the surrounding region. The land surrounding the crystal within a radius of 5 miles is transformed into lush forest as if by the [mirage arcane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mirage-arcane.md) spell, except pieces of the forest brought outside this range don't vanish. The magic has the following additional properties:

- **Dispelling the Shroud.** A [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell targeting an area of the forest ends the effect in a 20-foot cube for 1 hour if the caster succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability. The affected area reverts to a fetid swamp.  
- **Shifting the Shroud.** A creature in the glade can take limited control of the crystal by concentrating on it for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 25 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. A creature who takes control of the crystal can end the shroud for 24 hours or change it to a different type of terrain permanently. Additional creatures beyond the first can assist in controlling the crystal. For each additional creature who concentrates for the full hour, reduce the DC of the check by 1 (to a minimum of DC 15).  
- **Wild Magic.** The Feywild energy that fuels the crystal interacts unpredictably with other magic. Whenever a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher within the glade, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 saving throw using its spellcasting ability or roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) (see the "[Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md)" section in the "Player's Handbook").  

### Forest Crystal Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Forest Crystal or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Lost Legacy

A [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md) who lairs near the crystal approaches the characters and requests their aid. The minions of a rival dragon (creatures from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" in "chapter 3") seek to destroy the crystal. The rival, a [young black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-black-dragon.md), wishes to reclaim the swamp hidden by the crystal's magic because the swamp belonged to the dragon's ancestor.

#### Reclamation

Creatures from the "Cloud Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") assault the crystal, causing kobolds who live in the treetop huts to seek assistance. A [cloud giant destiny gambler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant-destiny-gambler-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") seeks to reconnect the crystal with others of its kind, including the remains of one that is now the "Singing Sands" (in this chapter). If the cloud giant is successful, the reestablished network of crystals could allow the giant to reshape great portions of the world.

#### To Cure a Kingdom

A virulent plague ravages the countryside. The only cure is a specific mushroom, but all accounts speak of it growing in a swamp that doesn't exist. The characters must use the Forest Crystal to reveal the swamp hidden beneath the magical forest. Then they must battle creatures from the "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") under the command of a [mummy lord](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/mummy-lord.md) to claim the cure.

#### Urban Renewal

A circle of [druids](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) uses ancient magic to amplify the crystal's power, spreading its land-warping influence. The crystal's growing shroud threatens to engulf a nearby city whose ruler has been hostile to the druids in the past. Creatures from the "Megafauna World Encounters table" in "chapter 3" spontaneously arise in the city and wreak havoc as the settlement transforms.

## Forsaken Deep

The coral-covered ruins of a storm giant retreat cling to the ocean floor at the edge of an undersea trench. Storm giants once used this place as a haven to contemplate omens, to refine experimental magic, and to commune with the ocean. Its peace shattered when death giants from the Shadowfell found a lightless river that led into the trench and killed the retreat's original inhabitants.

Portions of the retreat still hold foul air, but most areas have been flooded by the cold deep. The retreat's runic circle still channels elemental power from a portal to the Plane of Water deep in the trench, and crystalline archives hold lost knowledge of the giants who built them.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/055-map-4-06-forsaken-deep-player.webp#gallery)

Map 4.6 shows the ruins of the storm giant retreat and the trench, including the following features:

- **Library.** The retreat's flooded library holds five crystalline, coral archives that contain knowledge preserved in crackling lightning. The formations are 10 feet across and 20 feet high. Two are shattered and useless, but three still spark with knowledge.  
- **Meditation Chamber.** The great dome still holds the ocean at bay, but the air inside is fouled by time and rot. After each hour spent within the dome, a creature that breathes air must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition until it finishes a short or long rest in a place with fresh air. The restless spirits of the slain storm giants congregate in this chamber, harmlessly but mournfully wailing their sorrow. A circle of Giant runes on the floor hums softly (see "Storm Call" below).  
- **Trench.** The oceanic trench dives into darkness (see "Planar Crossing" below).  

### Forsaken Deep Magic

The Forsaken Deep has the following properties:

- **Lightning Archive.** A creature touching an archive can use an action to access the stored knowledge. Roll a `d10`. On a 1 or 2, the archive surges with lightning. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the `d10` roll was 3 or higher, the creature can query the archive as by a [commune](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune.md) spell. Once a creature uses the archive successfully, that creature can't do so again for 24 hours.  
- **Planar Crossing.** The trench below the retreat pierces the fabric of the planes. Two rifts in the planar fabric open in the depths of the trench, one leading to the Shadowfell and the other to the Elemental Plane of Water. Sluggish currents flow from each rift, each traveling about 200 feet before they meet and well upward, 500 feet below the fortress. By swimming against the current, a creature can pass through the rift that's the current's source and enter the connected plane.  
- **Storm Call.** A creature that meditates within the Meditation Chamber's rune circle for 10 minutes and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can create the effects of either the [control weather](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather.md) spell or the [control water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-water.md) spell, or both simultaneously (user's choice). The magic affects the ocean and surface above the retreat within a radius of 10 miles for up to 8 hours, requiring no concentration.  

### Forsaken Deep Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Forsaken Deep or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Burial at Sea

Restless spirits of the storm giants who died in the Forsaken Deep create a perpetual necrotic storm on the ocean surface above. To stop it, the characters must brave creatures from the "Elemental Water Encounters" and "Giant Necropolis Encounters" tables (see "chapter 3"), retrieve the giants' remains from the deep, and inter them in the "Ashen Grotto" (in this chapter).

#### Distant Thunder

The lightning archives hold the key to gaining control of the apparatus contained in the "Thundering Observatory" (in this chapter). A [death giant reaper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/death-giant-reaper-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") claims the deep with minions from the "Death Giant Encounters table" in "chapter 3", but the giant might trade this knowledge if the characters capture a [marid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/marid.md) thief and dispatch the marid's minions from the "Elemental Water Encounters table" (see "chapter 3").

#### Glory of the Storm

An [empyrean](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) daughter of Stronmaus seeks worthy heroes to lead into the Forsaken Deep. She hopes to earn a place at her father's side by proving herself in the depths against her wicked brother and his minions from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters" and "Storm Giant Encounters" tables (see "chapter 3"), and she promises Stronmaus's blessing to those who help her.

#### Inky Depths

A shadow-corrupted [kraken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md) lairs in the deep, steeping in the mingled planar energies there. It menaces ships over its waters, dragging sailors down to become [shadows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/shadow.md), [ghouls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md), and creatures from the "Elemental Water Encounters table" (see "chapter 3").

## Gale's Eye Tower

A tower built from a combination of stone and solidified clouds floats in the eye of a perpetual storm. The storm's intensity fluctuates, but it never dissipates completely. When it lacks a steady will to command it, the storm wanders the world.

Long ago, a cloud giant traveler built the tower as a wandering bastion against forces of chaos on the Material Plane. The traveler constructed it using a gift from the fabled Wind Dukes of Aaqa—beings of order from the Plane of Air who oppose the forces of chaos and Elemental Evil throughout the multiverse. This gift, the Labyrinth Funnel, is a conduit to the Plane of Air that fuels the tower's magic.

### Gale's Eye Tower Features

![Map 4.7: Gale's Eye Tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/056-map-4-07-gales-eye-tower.webp#center)

Map 4.7 depicts Gale's Eye Tower, including the following features:

- **Control Chamber.** The topmost level of the tower is covered by a roof and enclosed with unbreakable crystal windows.  
- **Labyrinth Funnel.** The Labyrinth Funnel (the Wind Dukes' gift) is a permanent cyclone in the center of the control chamber. The cyclone is a cylinder of strong winds 60 feet in diameter and 60 feet high. The eye of the cyclone is a column of crushing winds, 10 feet in diameter, that forms a portal leading to the Elemental Plane of Air. A creature that enters the central column takes 110 (`20d10`) thunder damage and appears in the realm known as Aaqa, a shining domain of silver spires and verdant gardens atop a fertile earth mote.  
- **Storm Wall.** The tower hangs suspended in the eye of a perpetual storm, surrounded by a wall of tempestuous weather (equivalent to the effect of the [wind wall](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wind-wall.md) spell) about 400 feet in diameter. Beyond that wall, the storm rages.  

### Gale's Eye Tower Magic

A creature within 5 feet of the Labyrinth Funnel can safely attune to it (remaining outside it) as if it were a magic item. While attuned to it and within the control chamber, the creature can control the tower's movement, control the surrounding storm, and summon creatures from the Plane of Air as follows:

- **Flying Tower.** While uncontrolled, Gale's Eye Tower drifts at an altitude of 500 feet at 8 miles per hour (80 feet per round). During its turn, a creature in the control chamber who is attuned to the Labyrinth Funnel can cause the tower to ascend or descend 100 feet, can stop the tower, or can change the tower's speed, to a maximum of 12 miles per hour (120 feet per round), in a direction of the creature's choice.  
- **Perpetual Storm.** While uncontrolled, the storm surrounding the tower creates light wind and occasional rain in a 5-mile radius. Every day, there is a 10 percent chance the storm spikes in intensity to become a full thunderstorm with strong winds and heavy precipitation for 24 hours. A creature in the control chamber who is attuned to the Labyrinth Funnel can cast [control weather](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather.md) (as an action) at will to change the conditions of the storm. The creature can also cast [call lightning](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/call-lightning.md) at will (spell save DC 17), targeting any point the creature can see under the perpetual storm regardless of range.  
- **Summoned Aid.** As an action, a creature in the control chamber who is attuned to the Labyrinth Funnel can summon an [air elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) or an [invisible stalker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) that serves the summoner. The summoned creature vanishes after 1 hour or when another creature is summoned with the funnel.  

### Gale's Eye Tower Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Gale's Eye Tower or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Glorious Aerie

A group of [aarakocra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/aarakocra.md) controls the tower, flying it across the countryside and assaulting servants of the cults of Elemental Evil. They have recruited creatures from the "Elemental Air Encounters table" in "chapter 3" to aid their campaign. The aarakocra know a secret method to stabilize the Labyrinth Funnel so it can be used safely as a portal.

#### Ill Winds Blow

[Frost giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) raiders are subverting the Labyrinth Funnel to connect to the "Howling Iceberg" (in this chapter). They manipulate the winds to bring the iceberg to the tower's location, but as a side effect, the perpetual storm grows more intense and ravages the surrounding countryside. Creatures from the "Frost Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") defend the tower while the giants work.

#### Silver Storm

An [adult silver dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon.md) took control of the tower when it drifted into her territory, and she is using its power to drive other beings from her domain. Towns in the area desperately call for help as endless storms assail them and an onslaught of creatures from the "Elemental Air Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") terrorizes the region.

#### Touch of Chaos

An artifact cursed by the cosmic touch of chaos can be cleansed in the Labyrinth Funnel, thanks to the funnel's connection to Aaqa. But when the artifact is brought into the tower, it temporarily corrupts the Labyrinth Funnel. Demons from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") appear in waves to thwart attempts to cleanse the artifact.

## Grolantor's Larder

In ages past, giants found a secluded valley surrounded by low hills. Blessed by nature deities or perhaps abundant energy from the Elemental Planes, the vale teems with game animals and produces an inexhaustible supply of delicious fruits and grains. The giants named it Grolantor's Larder for the god who would most appreciate its copious bounty.

Cares and sorrow melt away here, and the harshest weather beyond the valley becomes mild within its boundaries. A babbling stream feeds a sizable pond where fish thrive. Game animals graze lazily, and birds flit between the trees and brush. Those who find their way here can rarely muster the will to leave.

### Grolantor's Larder Features

![Map 4.8: Grolantor's Larder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/057-map-4-08-grolantors-larder.webp#center)

Map 4.8 depicts Grolantor's Larder, including the following features:

- **Groves.** Fruit trees and berry bushes fill the valley, and fields of wild grains surround it.  
- **Pond.** The pond brims with fish, and the cool stream that feeds it contains clear, safe water.  
- **Revelers' Clearing.** The central clearing is carpeted with lush, soft grass. A great flat stone propped upon smaller boulders serves as a table that can accommodate giants.  

### Grolantor's Larder Magic

The essential magic of Grolantor's Larder is the abundant growth of food-bearing plants, providing ample food for all who visit. Foraging in the grove is a simple task that requires no ability checks. With some extra effort, visitors can gather a feast of gigantic proportions, but this magic has its risks:

- **Boundless Bounty.** With 2 hours of foraging for the choicest foods, a character can gather enough magical food to furnish a [heroes' feast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heroes-feast.md) spell (no other components required). A creature who receives the benefits of the spell must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers uncomfortable indigestion for 12 hours. On a successful save, the creature gains the enlarge effect of the [enlarge/reduce](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell for 12 hours. Once this magical feast has been gathered, the grove can't furnish another until the next dawn.  
- **Entrapping Beauty.** After each hour a creature spends in Grolantor's Larder, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be unwilling to leave. A creature who has eaten food gathered from the grove in the last 24 hours has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat the save after finishing a long rest.  
- **Rampant Growth.** Seeds, fruits, and cuttings of food-bearing plants from Grolantor's Larder retain their magic for up to 7 days. If they are planted in that time, the plants that grow are enriched for 1 year and yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. After `1d4` such plant samples leave the grove, this property doesn't function until the next dawn.  

### Grolantor's Larder Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Grolantor's Larder or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Ashes of War

A war-torn country's farmland was razed and burned. The farmers need seeds and plant cuttings from Grolantor's Larder to replant their fields, but monsters from the "Dinosaur World Encounters" or "Megafauna World Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") inhabit the grove and view intruders as food.

#### Discerning Taste

The hill giant leader occupying Grolantor's Larder wants a delicacy from "Karontor's Hold" (in this chapter). He uncharacteristically offers to share wondrous food from the larder to anyone who manages to slay an [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) living in flooded tunnels beneath the castle and return with its meat. Creatures from the "Fomorian Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") stand in the adventurers' way.

#### Ravenous

[Hill giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) cultists led by a [maw of Yeenoghu](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/maw-of-yeenoghu-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") raid settlements close to the grove, capturing townsfolk to be the main course in a massive feast ritual. Giants, [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) and creatures from the "Hill Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") stand between the captives and freedom.

#### Safe Haven

The characters travel with refugees fleeing from disaster. The survivors are exhausted and starving when they stumble upon the grove. The [unicorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) who watches the grove and her [centaur](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) subjects will shelter the refugees if the characters agree to slay a nearby pride of [displacer beasts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) and creatures from the "Elemental Earth Encounters table" (see "chapter 3").

#### Wayward Son

A noble seeks adventurers to find and return her son, who vanished while traveling. His route passed by Grolantor's Larder, where the missing man became entranced by the sumptuous feast. [Satyrs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) and creatures from the "Cloud Giant Encounters table" in "chapter 3" entice the characters to join the feast permanently.

## Hiatea's Hearth

A stone feast hall of gigantic proportions radiates the warmth of hearth and home. The great flagstone floor, the massive throne, and the stone arch surrounding the cavernous fireplace are inscribed with runes extolling the god Hiatea and invoking her blessing upon all who shelter here.

Many dynasties of giants have claimed ownership of Hiatea's Hearth since its founding, and each one has known vast prosperity within its walls—followed by a spectacular fall. The magic of the hall invokes Hiatea's aspect as a tender of the hearth, but it also carries a curse laid by her brother Karontor. Whoever sits upon the throne brings fortune and glory to their people, but this prosperity is short-lived, lasting only until another supplants them.

### Hiatea's Hearth Features

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.9: Hiatea's Hearth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/058-map-4-09-hiateas-hearth.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/059-map-4-09-hiateas-hearth-player.webp#gallery)

Map 4.9 depicts Hiatea's Hearth, including the following features:

- **Feast Tables.** Several giant-sized tables carved from whole tree trunks run the length of the hall.  
- **Hearth.** An enormous fireplace holds iron spits, pots, and kettles within. Inscribed on the stone arch surrounding the fireplace are Giant runes.  
- **Throne.** An immense granite throne stands at the head of the hall. It is intricately decorated with stylized figures of giants and beasts, as well as more Giant runes.  

### Hiatea's Hearth Magic

Hiatea's Hearth carries Hiatea's blessing as well as the curse of Karontor, giving it the following properties:

- **Hiatea's Blessing.** Hiatea's Hearth is consecrated ground. A creature in the hall that has the Channel Divinity class feature and worships Hiatea can use that feature once without expending a use of it. Once a creature benefits from this property, the creature can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.  
- **Prosperity.** A creature can attune to the hall's throne as if it were a magic item. While the attuned creature sits on the throne, the creature's Charisma score becomes 25. While a creature is attuned to the throne, whether it sits there or not, any creature that finishes a short rest within Hiatea's Hearth removes 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and regains hit points as if the creature spent 2 Hit Dice without actually expending them. A creature's attunement to the throne can't end while the creature lives, and no other creature can attune to the throne until the attunement ends.  
- **What Rises Must Fall.** The creature attuned to the throne has disadvantage on Wisdom checks, initiative rolls, and death saving throws. Any creatures friendly to the creature attuned to the throne have the same disadvantage while within Hiatea's Hearth.  

### Hiatea's Hearth Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Hiatea's Hearth or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Dying Embers

An [efreeti](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) who claimed the throne has fought off several attempts to wrest Hiatea's Hearth away. In studying the hall's history, the efreeti realized the truth of the hall's curse. She is desperate to escape her fate and offers a handsome reward, including a suit of [plate armor of resistance (fire)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/armor-of-fire-resistance.md), to anyone who helps her survive the impending assault of creatures from the "Storm Giant Encounters table" in "chapter 3".

#### Ghosts of the Past

Creatures from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") have taken control of the hall but are plagued by restless spirits. The [ghosts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) and [wraiths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) of defeated foes, along with creatures from the "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" (see "chapter 3"), refuse to rest in peace.

#### Head to Head to Head

Two rival factions of giant kin vie to claim the throne. An [ettin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ettin.md) and a [fensir skirmisher](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fensir-skirmisher-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") each entice the characters to side with them and their followers from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") to break the stalemate, offering treasure and aid in the characters' endeavors.

#### Infernal Bargain

A [bone devil](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) knows the power of Hiatea's Hearth and is tempting a [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) to claim the throne, but the giant's wife knows the throne's curse will mean her love's certain doom. She begs adventurers to help her thwart the devil's designs, because she can't take on the devil's minions (from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" in "chapter 3") alone.

#### Turn of the Dynasty

The [stone giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) thane who controls Hiatea's Hearth fears their dynasty ending and seeks an alliance with the giants at the "Endless Rockslide" (in this chapter), but the giants there are plotting the thane's downfall. Choose any of the "encounter tables" in "chapter 3" to determine who controls the Endless Rockslide.

## Horizon's Edge

Horizon's Edge is a demiplane refuge that drifts in the roiling fog of the Deep Ethereal plane, beyond a shimmering, golden ethereal curtain. The demiplane is a serene bubble of air dotted with floating platforms of stone supporting enormous structures.

An ancient empire of giants achieved magical and technological advances that outshine those of the present age: spanning worlds and planes, building cyclopean monuments and intricate art, and wielding magic of almost unimaginable power. As this mighty empire neared its collapse, its greatest mages created Horizon's Edge to preserve some of the glories of their civilization. The demiplane might still hold secrets lost to the rest of the multiverse, including tools and devices that fuse magical and technological techniques.

### Horizon's Edge Features

![Map 4.10: Horizon's Edge](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/060-map-4-10-horizons-edge.webp#center)

Map 4.10 depicts Horizon's Edge, including the following features:

- **Building Platforms.** Massive plates made of meticulously fitted stones form patches of solid ground upon which giant-sized structures are built.  
- **Rune Ring.** A great ring of glowing Giant runes slowly rotates around the equator of the spherical demiplane. A creature who studies the runes and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check realizes their rotation marks out repeating 12-hour cycles, allowing visitors to keep time with the Material Plane worlds they came from.  
- **Transport Disks.** Inlaid near one edge of each platform is a distinct 20-foot-diameter magical disk of intricately woven copper, iron, and silver. A creature standing on one of these disks can use an action to manipulate sliding portions of the disk and designate a destination platform. If the creature succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, the disk flies at a speed of 60 feet to the destination, where it hovers for 1 minute or until no more creatures or objects are on it, then returns to its original position. A creature who succeeds on this check automatically succeeds on future attempts to fly any disk to the same destination.  

### Horizon's Edge Magic

In contrast to the other locations described in this chapter, Horizon's Edge is notable more for the magic and technology it contains than for any magic inherent to the site itself. However, the magically created demiplane has one peculiar property:

- **Looped Gravity.** The outer boundary of the demiplane warps space. Anything that falls without being arrested passes through the bottom of the bubble. It then reappears at the top directly above that point and continues plummeting until something arrests its fall.  

> [!note] 
> 
> Entering Horizon's Edge
> 
> The lost giant empire left puzzle cubes scattered across the Material and Inner Planes, and these cubes are among the few ways to enter Horizon's Edge. A [Horizon puzzle cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/horizon-puzzle-cube-bgg.md) is an 8-inch magical cube made of gold, iron, crystal, and copper, and it is worth 5,000 gp to a sage or collector. A functioning puzzle cube can be solved with 30 minutes of work and a successful DC 25 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. When the cube is solved, a 30-foot-diameter portal appears before the creature who solved the cube, leading to the northeastern platform of Horizon's Edge. The portal is two-way and remains open for 10 minutes or until a creature uses an action to change the puzzle's configuration. Puzzle cubes don't function while on Horizon's Edge, but a device somewhere in the demiplane allows a cube to function in reverse while the cube is fitted into it.
> 
> Without a puzzle cube, the [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell can reach the demiplane, but the specifications for the tuning fork necessary for the spell to access the plane are lost. A trek through the Deep Ethereal might reveal the single ethereal curtain that reaches the demiplane.
^10c

### Horizon's Edge Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Horizon's Edge or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Key to the Past

Archaeologists hire the characters to help operate a [Horizon puzzle cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/horizon-puzzle-cube-bgg.md) (see the ""Entering Horizon's Edge"" sidebar) and protect them from any hazards in the demiplane. Creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" in "chapter 3" are trapped in the realm and attack the expedition, seeking a means of escape.

#### Reforged in Starlight

Pieces of a broken magic item found in the demiplane and guarded by creatures from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") still hold lingering traces of magic. Every attempt to repair the item fails. A platinum tablet refers to the "Star Forge" (in this chapter) as the place where the item was created and suggests the forge is the only place it can be repaired.

#### Scourge of Demons

A storm giant learned the ancient giants' empire collapsed due to demonic corruption, and she vowed to destroy every remnant of that corruption. She offers fantastic rewards to heroes who will venture to Horizon's Edge and rid it of creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" in "chapter 3".

## Howling Iceberg

The Howling Iceberg is a massive chunk of glacial ice, sapphire blue where the light refracts and gleaming white where it reflects. The iceberg is riddled with convoluted tunnels through which perpetual winds howl. It was created by frost giant cultists of the demon lord [Kostchtchie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kostchtchie-bgdia.md) around a sliver of ice from the Frostfell, the Plane of Ice that forms the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water. The iceberg never melts, and its perpetual winds blow from the planes, carrying the biting cold of the Frostfell and the torturous howls of Pandemonium.

### Howling Iceberg Features

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.11: Howling Iceberg](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/061-map-4-11-howling-iceberg.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/062-map-4-11-howling-iceberg-player.webp#gallery)

Map 4.11 shows the Howling Iceberg, which has the following features:

- **Biting Winds.** The area within 500 feet of the Howling Iceberg is always extreme cold, and strong winds blow throughout that area in the direction of the iceberg's movement. When undirected, the iceberg drifts up to 4 miles per hour (40 feet per round) with the tide and winds.  
- **Longhouse (A).** An ancient, weathered longhouse sits on a flat plain of ice and snow. Trophy hides and horns of monsters decorate the walls and roof of this structure.  
- **Tunnels.** Openings in the ice lead to twisting tunnels, some naturally formed by wind and water, others tooled and cut, and still others melted by great heat. A creature who finishes a long rest in the tunnels must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) from the howling winds wearing down the creature's mind.  

### Howling Iceberg Magic

The tunnels in the Howling Iceberg twist deeper than should be possible. A creature exploring the tunnels can make a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check after each hour. A creature that succeeds on three checks in a row or that rolls a 20 on the `d20` finds a special destination, as shown on the Howling Iceberg Tunnels table.

![Howling Iceberg Tunnels](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/howling-iceberg-tunnels-bgg.md)

A creature who finds the Frostfell Shard can attune to it as if it were a magic item. If the creature finishes a long rest more than 1 mile from the iceberg, the creature's attunement to the shard ends. The shard can't be moved. Attunement to the shard gives the following benefits:

- **Howling Wind.** While on the Howling Iceberg, a creature attuned to the shard who doesn't have the [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition can direct the winds to howl and propel the iceberg up to 8 miles per hour (80 feet per round) in a direction of the creature's choice. The iceberg continues this movement until the attuned creature changes the direction and speed or the creature's attunement ends.  
- **Planar Tunnels.** A creature attuned to the shard can navigate the tunnels within the iceberg to reach any desired destination in 1 hour without making an ability check. The creature is also immune to the exhausting effects of the howling winds in the tunnels.  
- **Spellcasting.** While on the Howling Iceberg, a creature attuned to the shard can cast the [control weather](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather.md) (to lower the temperature and manipulate wind only), [cone of cold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold.md), [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md), and [gust of wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spells (spell save DC 17), requiring no material components. Once the creature uses this property to cast a spell, the creature can't cast that spell with the property again until it finishes a long rest.  
- **Weather Resistance.** A creature attuned to the iceberg's shard is resistant to cold damage and immune to the effects of strong wind.  

The Frostfell Shard can be destroyed by dealing at least 75 fire damage to it in a single turn, whereupon it melts and the iceberg shatters.

### Howling Iceberg Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Howling Iceberg or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Frigid Depths

A horde of [merrow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) and [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) use the iceberg to raid coastal settlements and shipping lanes, commanding creatures from the "Elemental Air Encounters" and "Elemental Water Encounters" tables in "chapter 3".

#### On Ice

A pair of [remorhazes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md) and creatures from the "Frost Giant Encounters table" leave the iceberg when it drifts ashore, hunting local animals and people. They drag many captives to the iceberg to store for future meals.

#### Winds of Chaos

A [death slaad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/death-slaad.md) leading other slaadi emerges from the portal to Pandemonium. Along with creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" (see "chapter 3"), all driven wild by the winds, they maraud nearby settlements.

## Karontor's Hold

Karontor's Hold is a small keep (by giant standards) that stands on a lonely rock bluff. The approach is disorienting: the keep seems closer—or sometimes farther—than it actually is. Creatures that sleep in the vicinity find their rest plagued by disturbing dreams and unintelligible whispers that hint at something simultaneously enticing and repulsive.

Beneath the keep is a well that once held a portal to the Feywild. Ancient fomorians built Karontor's Hold around the font to study and harness its power. They used this crossing to launch an ill-fated assault on the Feywild. When the offending fomorians were exiled to the Underdark, the well's magic was twisted into a connection to the alien Far Realm.

### Karontor's Hold Features

> ![Map 4.12: Karontor's Hold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/063-map-4-12-karontors-hold.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/064-map-4-12-karontors-hold-player.webp#gallery)

Map 4.12 shows Karontor's Hold, including the following features:

- **Far Realm Distortion.** The physical structure of the hold is warped near and above the well. Within this area, glistening stone flows like viscous liquid, sickly purplish radiance gleams at the edge of perception, and the air has an acrid taste.  
- **Throne Room.** Damaged bas-reliefs on the walls of the crumbling throne room depict [fomorian nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fomorian-noble-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") passing through a portal, girded for battle. The next scene, presumably the aftermath, is defaced and illegible.  
- **Well.** A giant-sized well in the keep's deepest level plunges a seemingly infinite depth. Faint purple light shines from the depths, and psychic whispers caress the mind of anyone who peers into the depths. A 5-foot-high wall surrounds the well.  

### Karontor's Hold Magic

The Far Realm intrusion flowing from the well in Karontor's Hold twists space and time in and around the keep to a range of 6 miles. The enclave has the following properties:

- **Dilated Time.** The Far Realm distortion in Karontor's Hold warps creatures' perception of time in stressful situations. At the start of each creature's turn in combat, roll a `d4`. On an even number, the creature's speed is halved until the end of the turn. On an odd number, the creature's speed is doubled until the end of the turn. Aberrations and creatures with a psychic gift from the Psychic Well (see below) are immune to this effect.  
- **Psychic Well.** A creature can try to harness the psychic power of the well by gazing into it for 1 minute while remaining within 10 feet of the well. At the end of the minute, the creature must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (`4d10`) psychic damage and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). On a successful save, the creature gains a psychic gift of its choice: either the ability to cast the [dimension door](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door.md) spell requiring no spell components, or the use of a [mind flayer's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) Mind Blast action. The psychic gift fades when the creature uses it, or if it tries to harness the well again. While this psychic gift is available, the creature also gains telepathy to a range of 30 feet (as described in the "Monster Manual"). Once a creature attempts to harness the power of the well, the creature can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.  
- **Twisted Space.** Roll a `d4` when creatures travel within 6 miles of the keep. On a 1, the creatures travel normally. On a 2 or a 4, distance stretches and the journey takes longer than it should; multiply the distance creatures have to travel by the number rolled. On a 3, distance constricts and the journey is faster; divide the distance by 3. Roll once for creatures traveling as a group. This effect ends once creatures enter the keep or get farther than 6 miles from it.  

### Karontor's Hold Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to Karontor's Hold or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Amplified Intrusion

A [fomorian deep crawler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fomorian-deep-crawler-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") lurking in the hold has designs on the "Forest Crystal" (in this chapter), seeking to corrupt it and use its magic to spread the Far Realm intrusion. While some of its minions—creatures from the "Fomorian Encounters table" (see "chapter 3")—defend Karontor's Hold, others carry cursed objects into the forest to infuse their corruption into the crystal. If these minions are successful, the Forest Crystal becomes an extension of the Far Realm's intrusion.

#### Fallen Storm

A [storm giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) who sought to cleanse the Far Realm corruption from the keep has succumbed to the corruption and now gathers creatures from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" in "chapter 3" to unleash on surrounding settlements. The giant can be cleansed of Far Realm influence by the [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) or [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell, but only if the spell is cast while the giant has the [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition and the caster succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability.

#### Food for Thought

A colony of [mind flayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) flooded the well room with brine, and they are collecting brains to feed a nascent [elder brain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/elder-brain-mpmm.md). They send dominated creatures from the "Hill Giant Encounters table" in "chapter 3" to fetch victims. An ally of the characters survives the assault and asks the characters for help.

## Misty Vale

The Misty Vale is a remote mountain valley that exists simultaneously in many places across different worlds of the Material Plane. Aside from the perpetual fog that encloses it, the valley looks much like any other at first glance. A closer investigation reveals its anomalies: terrain features and structures in the valley that don't make sense, many of which change from one visit to the next.

Cloud giant sorcerers from an ancient empire of giants combined their might to turn a mountain into a vanishing fortress, but they weren't fully successful. The mountain vanished, as did everyone and everything on it, and in its place is the Misty Vale. The fabric of the Material Plane is tangled and torn where the mountain once stood, so the valley links multiple worlds together. Because of the unpredictable nature of this tangle in space, bizarre events surround the Misty Vale as creatures, objects, and entire settlements shift—in whole or in part—from one world to another, unmoored from their proper place in reality.

### Misty Vale Features

![Map 4.13: Misty Vale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/065-map-4-13-misty-vale.webp#center)

Map 4.13 shows the Misty Vale, including the following features:

- **Foggy Border.** The edges of the valley are "heavily obscured" by fog, which thins to "lightly obscuring" mist in the valley itself.  
- **Grounded Boat.** A riverboat rests on a grassy hill, canted to one side. There is no water anywhere near it and no sign of it being dragged.  
- **Misty Canyon.** Gravel-choked, fog-shrouded ravines lead to and from the vale.  
- **Partial Village.** Some houses in this village are intact and others only partially present, as if they were sliced in half and set down gently in their current place. The interiors are perfectly in order, as if the human-sized occupants walked away moments ago.  

### Misty Vale Magic

The Misty Vale has the following properties:

- **Guardian.** A creature known as "the guardian" is the only being that can control the Misty Vale's movements and connections among worlds. The guardian's exact form is unknown and changes from encounter to encounter, but its alignment is always chaotic neutral, its Intelligence is at least 16, and it speaks both Common and Giant. You can roll on any "encounter table" in "chapter 3" to determine the guardian's current form. If the guardian dies, it re-forms in a new guise at the next dawn. A creature can convince the guardian to grant safe passage to virtually any location on the Material Plane by one of three methods: answering a riddle posed by the guardian, offering a valuable gift such as a magic item or a secret to the guardian, or verbal argument. The last option requires a successful DC 25 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.  
- **Multiversal.** The Misty Vale connects to other places on the world and to different worlds of the Material Plane. The surrounding fog acts as a portal when the valley connects to a new place, allowing two-way travel.  
- **Shrouded Presence.** Divination spells cast from outside the vale can't target anything in the valley or reveal information about it. Trying to navigate the dense fog into or out of the valley without the aid of the guardian requires 1 hour of travel and a DC 20 group Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. On a successful check, the group finds its way to or from the valley. On a failed check, the travelers wander the foggy terrain for 1 additional hour before they can repeat the check.  

### Misty Vale Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Misty Vale or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Hospitality

A community of [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) living in the vale offers the characters hospitality, perhaps while the characters are traveling and lost in fog. If the characters spend the night in the village, they find the valley connected to a different place in the morning, and the villagers have transformed into murderous creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" in "chapter 3".

#### Price of Passage

The guardian of the vale (appearing as an [androsphinx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/androsphinx.md)) demands a golden apple from "Grolantor's Larder" (in this chapter) in exchange for safe passage to a destination of the characters' choice. At the larder, a [hill giant avalancher](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant-avalancher-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") hoards three golden apples, which act as [potions of heroism](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-heroism.md), and leads a band from the "Hill Giant Encounters table" in "chapter 3".

#### Unexpected Hunger

Hill giant raiders stumbled into answering the guardian's riddle by coincidentally having the answer in one of their bags—a live sheep—and they now raid targets through the valley's mists. Creatures from the "Hill Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") appear in places they shouldn't, raid for food and treasure, and then vanish into the valley.

## Runic Circle

The Runic Circle combines the functions of a giant's spellbook, an astronomical chart, and a beacon to travelers beyond the stars. The ancient giants who created the circle traveled to distant lands and other worlds. Those who stayed behind used the circle to maintain communication with explorers, helping them pilot their flying ships home.

Standing stones form a great circle inscribed into a flat stone hilltop. The stones bear Giant runes, carved constellations, and strange symbols. On the ground, an enormous circle of Giant runes of power links the monoliths and circumscribes smaller circles of runes. Carved lines throughout the circle link different strings of symbols.

### Runic Circle Features

![Map 4.14: Runic Circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/066-map-4-14-runic-circle.webp#center)

Map 4.14 depicts the Runic Circle, including the following features:

- **Carvings.** The carvings are a combination of Giant runes of power, magical formulas like those in a wizard's spellbook, and extremely accurate charts of stars and other bodies in the sky.  
- **Shelters.** Simple shelters of tight-fitted stone, just large enough to hold a single giant, dot the area around the hill. Most are partially reclaimed by nature, but some have been maintained.  
- **Standing Stones.** The outer circle is formed of 40-foot-tall stone monoliths that bear constellation carvings and Giant runes of power. At night, the star carvings shed dim light for 10 feet.  

### Runic Circle Magic

The Runic Circle has the following properties:

- **Magic Archive.** The inscribed runes make up a gigantic archive of spells. With 1 hour of study, a creature that is capable of casting spells can try to decipher a spell coded in the carvings. The spell is subject to your approval and must belong to the conjuration, divination, or evocation school. If the creature has spell slots of the appropriate level and succeeds on an Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check with a DC equal to 10 + the desired spell's level, the creature can cast the spell immediately without expending a spell slot. A character that is a wizard can copy the spell into the character's [spellbook](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spellbook.md) following the usual procedure, but must do so within 24 hours, or the character must repeat the hour of study to try again.  
- **Star Port.** The largest circle of runes is a permanent teleportation circle. Additionally, at night, a character can spend 10 minutes tracing constellation carvings that match the stars visible in the sky to cast the [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell from the circle. If the target is on the Material, Astral, or Ethereal Plane, there is no chance the message doesn't arrive, and the recipient knows the direction to the Runic Circle until it finishes a long rest. Targets on other worlds of the Material Plane might perceive the direction as nonsense, such as in the sky, in the ground, or in a direction that doesn't correspond to three-dimensional space.  

### Runic Circle Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Runic Circle or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Falling Feud

Two flying ships crash at the Runic Circle, appearing as a great fireball blazing through the night sky. Characters who investigate this celestial event find [mind flayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) skirmishing with [githyanki warriors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) and a [githyanki knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) amid the wreckage of their vessels. Both sides are desperate and offer rewards to the characters for their help.

#### Far-Flung Invaders

Creatures from another world appear in the circle during a stellar conjunction, then attack the surrounding area. The invaders might be creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" or "Dinosaur World Encounters table" in "chapter 3", or they could be other creatures of your choice. Waves of invaders appear throughout the night, unless the characters can activate the proper sequences of runes and star carvings to sever the invaders' connection to the circle.

#### Missing Coordinates

Characters in search of a crucial secret at the circle find the sequence of star charts they need is damaged. The only place the charts still exist is in the "Forsaken Deep" (in this chapter), in recorded storm giant prophecies. [Mind flayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) and their dominated minions from the "Fomorian Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") race the characters to the prize.

#### Shipyard

A [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) shipwright is studying the records in the circle with her apprentices and minions from the "Fire Giant Encounters table" (see "chapter 3"), puzzling out the secret of creating the flying ships used by the civilization that built the circle. She demands tribute in the form of magical metal treasure to allow the characters to access the circle. She also accepts a fragment from the core of a supposedly inert [runic colossus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/runic-colossus-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6").

## Singing Sands

A patch of glittering, powdered crystal melodically chimes as the desert wind blows it in small, rolling dunes. The Singing Sands shine like diamonds in the harsh desert sun, soaking up light and heat as their lonely song echoes through the wastes. At night the song goes quiet, and the sands rise into a solid memory of a simple, giant-created fort.

The Singing Sands were once a single object, a massive crystal created by a lost empire of giants (similar to the "Forest Crystal" in this chapter). The crystal's function is lost to time, but it was part of a network of such devices and was protected by a small fortress. The sand takes on the fortress' shape at night, crystallizing into the memory of its former home.

> [!quote]- A quote from Diancastra  
> 
> Oh, I could sing you such tales of the Singing Crystal, before it crumbled to sand. But you would weep forever.

### Singing Sands Features

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.15: Singing Sands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/067-map-4-15-singing-sands.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/068-map-4-15-singing-sands-player.webp#gallery)

During the day, the Singing Sands consist of two small dunes of gleaming, crystalline sand. The wind blows the sand across the desert at 1 mile per hour (10 feet per round). It reflects the sun and shines brightly, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight within 50 feet of them. As the sand moves, its melodious chimes are audible to 1 mile away. When a creature moves through the sand, the chiming becomes a discordant shriek.

Map 4.15 depicts the Singing Sands at night, when the sand forms a glowing, warm shelter. The construction matches a giant's proportions, but the architectural style is familiar only from ancient ruins. The temperature inside the fortress is always comfortable.

### Singing Sands Magic

The Singing Sands don't just make music; creatures can use music to shape the sand to their will. As an action, a creature can sing or play music to magically shape the Singing Sands into physical objects as it desires. If the creature succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma ([Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check, the creature can form up to a 5-foot cube of the sand into any shape. The resulting object is made of sparkling, crystalline sand and lasts for 1 hour. For every 5 by which the creature exceeds the DC, the creature can either shape an additional 5-foot cube or increase the duration by 1 hour. Alternatively, the creature can create a permanent crystal version of a simple or martial melee weapon with the light property, or a crystal version of an object worth up to 10 gp from the "Adventuring Gear table" in the "Player's Handbook". Once a creature shapes a permanent object from the sand, the creature can't do so again until it finishes `1d4` long rests.

### Singing Sands Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Singing Sands or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Desert Dreams

[Goliath giant-kin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goliath-giant-kin-bgg.md) escort a nervous [stone giant rockspeaker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant-rockspeaker-bgg.md) (both in "chapter 6") who needs to commune with his dreams within the crystal sand fortress at night. While he does, creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters" and "Elemental Earth Encounters" tables in "chapter 3" manifest from the sand and attack.

#### Lingering Ties

A flock of [giant vultures](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-vulture.md) follows the Singing Sands through the day, circling over creatures who investigate it. After dark, creatures from the "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") burst from the sand and attack anyone in the fortress. The vultures pick off stragglers and feast on the fallen. The creatures that emerge from the sand come from a lost city that holds an intact crystal like the one the Singing Sands once was, and the magical connection between the crystals endures.

#### Living Sands

Settlements along a fertile river in the desert are attacked by [purple worms](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) made of crystalline sand. Tales told by the locals lead to the Singing Sands, where hostile creatures from the "Megafauna World Encounters tables" (see "chapter 3") appear, but the creatures are made of sand.

#### Searching for the Key

A lost group of [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) spotted the Singing Sands and followed them into the desert. The giants know they can sing to make the sand do what they want, but none of them can carry a tune, so they're frustrated and ready to smash intruders to pieces.

#### Wanderer's Hope

A [cloud giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md) in an airship seeks the Singing Sands, claiming the desert was once the seat of a powerful empire of giants. The giant wants the characters to distract creatures from the "Elemental Fire Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") defending the sand. The giant hopes to use the sand to create a compass to locate "Gale's Eye Tower" (in this chapter).

## Star Forge

The Star Forge blazes on a small obsidian island in a lake formed in the crater where a star fell to earth. The Forge's incandescent iron furnace spills light across the dark glass and still water, casting long shadows toward the slopes of the crater.

The star fell ages ago, devastating the surrounding land. Giants of a now-vanished empire found the star in a cradle of obsidian and built the iron forge around it to channel its power into their craft.

### Star Forge Features

![Map 4.16: Star Forge](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/069-map-4-16-star-forge.webp#center)

Map 4.16 shows the Star Forge, including the following features:

- **Furnace.** The forge itself is a great housing of iron. Pipes extend from a central vessel, channeling the radiance of the forge into a vent so bright it's painful to look at. Giant runes etched on the iron flare with white light. The Star Forge sheds bright light for 100 feet and dim light for another 100 feet. An Undead that starts its turn in the bright light takes 3 (`1d6`) radiant damage. On a clear night, the light is visible for 300 miles.  
- **Shelters.** Iron and stone dwellings dot the shore, some collapsed, others carefully maintained.  
- **Bridge Remnant.** An iron bridge once spanned the water from the lakeshore to the island. Now rusted iron pilings are all that remain.  

### Star Forge Magic

A creature with proficiency in appropriate artisan's tools can use the Star Forge to create magic items using those tools and an amount of materials based on the item's rarity. For every 8 hours of work, the creature can make an Intelligence check using its tool proficiency, with a DC set by the item's rarity. On a successful check, the creature makes 100 gp worth of progress. On a failed check, no progress is made. For every 10 by which the check exceeds the DC, the creature makes an additional 100 gp of progress. The item is complete when the progress equals the cost of materials for the item. See the Star Forge Item Creation table for item rarity, cost, and check DC.

![Star Forge Item Creation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/star-forge-item-creation-bgg.md)

Additionally, a creature that works material in the workshop area can use the forge to cast the [fabricate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fabricate.md) spell requiring no spell components. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Star Forge Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Star Forge or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### A Star Is Reborn

Thieves damaged the Giant runes stabilizing the Star Forge, and the fallen star at the forge's heart is regaining its former magnitude. As the star's power grows, frequent earthquakes release creatures from the "Elemental Earth Encounters" and "Elemental Fire Encounters" tables (see "chapter 3") into the surrounding area. Unless the runes are repaired, the star threatens to consume the region—or perhaps the whole world.

#### Forging a Throne

A dwarf smith hopes to use the Star Forge to create a crown that will end a war of succession in their clan, but they need protection to reach the forge and finish their work. The forge is protected by an [iron golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) fueled by radiant energy and other creatures from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" in "chapter 3".

#### Guiding Whispers

A voice whispers into a character's dreams, leading the character toward the Star Forge. The voice offers instructions for creating a fantastic magic item, but creatures from the "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") desperately oppose the work.

#### Magnum Opus

A [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) forge master is close to creating their greatest work, a [runic colossus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/runic-colossus-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6"), but they lack a crucial component. If the characters find the "Singing Sands" (in this chapter), evade or destroy the sand's guardians from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" (see "chapter 3"), and fill a vial with the magical sand, the giant helps them create a sentient magic item.

#### Ravenous Star

An [azer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/azer.md) begs the characters for help. Other azers at the Star Forge are forced to work for an [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) that claims to be a scion of a living star, Hadar the Dark Hunger. The azers' work supplies the aboleth's minions from the "Fomorian Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") with formidable weapons and armor.

## Thundering Observatory

A gigantic turret of stone and crystal hangs in the sky, suspended between two breathtakingly tall mountain peaks by twin tethers of rumbling lightning. The light and rolling thunder herald the location's existence for many miles, though it's so remote that only a handful of people have ever seen it, and fewer still have explored it.

The few people who have managed to enter and explore the Thundering Observatory have thus far discovered only its remote viewing potential and not the full truth of the suspended turret. Most creatures can't comfortably remain in the turret long enough to puzzle out its true purpose as a doomsday weapon built by a lost empire of giants.

### Thundering Observatory Features

![Map 4.17: Thundering Observatory](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/070-map-4-17-thundering-observatory.webp#center)

Map 4.17 depicts the Thundering Observatory, including the following features:

- **Lightning Tethers.** The tethers holding up the observatory shed bright light for 50 feet and dim light for an additional 50 feet. They also emit a constant, loud rumble audible for 10 miles. This constant thunder is so intense that any creature within the turret has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. Creatures with resistance or immunity to thunder damage are immune to this disorientation. A creature that touches or enters the tether for the first time on a turn, or that starts its turn in the tether, takes 55 (`10d10`) lightning damage.  
- **Observation Chamber.** The lowest floor of the observatory has transparent crystal walls that offer a spectacular view of the surrounding region. A magic control console made of copper and gold occupies this chamber.  

### Thundering Observatory Magic

A creature in the Observation Chamber can use the control console to activate the following properties:

- **Death Ray.** As an action, a creature can use the observatory controls to direct a deadly bolt of magical energy at a point it can see, including locations viewed through the observatory's Remote Viewing property (but not through any other means of scrying or magical sensing). The ray creates a line of destruction 10 feet wide starting from the target point and progressing 100 feet in a direction of the creature's choice. Creatures and objects in that line take 143 (`26d10`) force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points is disintegrated into fine gray ash and can be returned to life only by a [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection.md) or [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. A creature that activates this property gains 6 levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). Immunity to lightning or thunder damage reduces the number of levels gained by 1 for each such immunity.  
- **Remote Viewing.** As an action, a creature operating the controls can make a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, the creature can cast the [scrying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) spell (spell save DC 17) from the device. A magical image of the target appears before the controls.  

### Thundering Observatory Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Thundering Observatory or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Collateral Damage

Factions consisting of creatures from the "encounter tables" for two kinds of giants in "chapter 3" have damaged the observatory in their struggle for control of the site, and its energy is building toward an overload. To stop the imminent explosion, the characters must negotiate with or get through the fighting creatures to repair the control console.

#### Escalation

[Goliath giant-kin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goliath-giant-kin-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") who live on one of the nearby mountains are at war with creatures from the "Giant Kin Encounters table" in "chapter 3". On the brink of destruction, the goliaths hope the observatory they have seen from afar can tip the scales in their favor, and they hire adventurers to secure it.

#### Final Key

A [storm giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) offers the characters a stunning reward if the characters can use the "Star Forge" (in this chapter) to build him a machine component. Once they do, an [adult gold dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-gold-dragon.md) warns them the giant intends to use the component to activate the Thundering Observatory as a doomsday weapon.

#### Fire When Ready

A [frost giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) plans to use the observatory's Death Ray to destroy her rivals in "Hiatea's Hearth" (in this chapter). The current ruler of Hiatea's Hearth has learned of the giant's plan and implores the characters to thwart it. Creatures from the "Frost Giant Encounters" and "Elemental Air Encounters" tables (see "chapter 3") defend the observatory.

#### History Lesson

A rock gnome [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) has pieced together accounts from ancient sites leading to the observatory. Creatures from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" in "chapter 3", fueled by magical lightning, deny entrance to the turret when the characters escort the gnome there to study.

## Worldroot Sapling

In a remote corner of the world, immense, thorny tree roots twist across the barren ground. In the center of this desolate tangle, an enormous sapling gleams with the green of fresh growth, clearly a young tree despite its prodigious size. This is the Worldroot Sapling, a spark of defiant life amid the remnants of dead plants and ashen ground.

The sapling is a seedling from the world tree Yggdrasil, planted and nurtured by an enigmatic group of giants called the Worldroot Circle (described in "chapter 2"). Some tales speak of the world tree stretching through every plane and world of the multiverse, while others say wicked dragons long ago gnawed on and poisoned the great tree. Whatever the fate of Yggdrasil, the Worldroot Sapling stands as a symbol of hope and the perseverance of life. The life energy of the sapling suffuses the ground in the clearing, and the light it sheds soothes weariness and eases pain.

### Worldroot Sapling Features

![Map 4.18: Worldroot Sapling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/071-map-4-18-worldroot-sapling.webp#center)

Map 4.18 depicts the Worldroot Sapling, including the following features:

- **Gnarled Roots.** The great, twisted roots of an enormous dead tree cover a vast area surrounding the sapling. The roots bristle with immense thorns, some up to 5 feet long. The roots can be climbed easily, but a creature that moves more than half its speed on its turn while within 5 feet of the roots must succeed on a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or take 11 (`2d10`) piercing damage.  
- **Sapling.** The Worldroot Sapling stands in a clearing created by the twisting roots. The sapling is 30 feet tall, and its trunk is 10 feet in diameter. Despite its size, it has the proportions and appearance of a very young tree. The tree glows with a bright, greenish-golden light for 30 feet, and dim light reaches an additional 30 feet.  

### Worldroot Sapling Magic

The Worldroot Sapling has the following properties:

- **Font of Life.** A dead creature buried in the soil within 30 feet of the sapling for 24 hours returns to life as if by a [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell. Once this property has been used, all properties of the sapling are suppressed for 30 days. Alternatively, a dead creature buried in the clearing's soil more than 30 feet from the sapling for 24 hours returns to life as if by a [reincarnation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/reincarnate.md) spell.  
- **Invigorating Light.** A creature within the bright light shed by the sapling has advantage on ability checks and saving throws based on Constitution and Wisdom. A creature that finishes a long rest within the bright light removes all levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) it has.  
- **Life-Giving Sap.** If the sapling's bark is pierced or cut, it bleeds enough golden sap to fill a vial. The sap functions as a [potion of vitality](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-vitality.md). A creature that drinks a vial of sap stops aging while it remains within the clearing. The tree can produce `1d4` vials in a 24-hour period, and a vial loses its magic after 24 hours.  

### Worldroot Sapling Adventures

Here are sample adventure hooks to bring characters to the Worldroot Sapling or to give them missions to pursue there.

#### Deathly Hunger

Cloud giants of the Worldroot Circle defend the sapling against ravenous Undead who wish to feed on the tree's life energy. The giants send an urgent, magical call for help. [Wraiths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wraith.md), [vampire spawn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn.md), and creatures from the "Giant Necropolis Encounters table" in "chapter 3" assault the sapling.

#### Persistent Knowledge

A venerable sage is desperate to escape the looming threat of death. Becoming Undead is odious to them, and their search to extend their life led them to the Worldroot Sapling. The sage hires the characters to destroy or disable the thorn-covered versions of creatures from the "Giant Construct Encounters table" (see "chapter 3") who guard the sapling against all intruders.

#### Rotten Roots

A [stone giant of Evil Earth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant-of-evil-earth-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") and the giant's evil minions from the "Elemental Earth Encounters table" in "chapter 3" have taken control of the Worldroot Sapling. The cultists are pouring corrupt earth elemental energy into the sapling, twisting it to create a [gargantua](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/gargantua-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6"). A [stone giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) seer begs the characters to help her thwart the cult.

#### Spreading Branches

A group of [firbolg primeval wardens](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/firbolg-primeval-warden-bgg.md) (see "chapter 6") seek to reconnect the "Forest Crystal" and "Singing Sands" (both in this chapter) to a magical network that once spanned the world. The firbolgs believe they can use the network created by an ancient civilization of giants to channel the sapling's life energy to revitalize devastated regions of the world. They need help carrying cuttings of the sapling to the two sites. Along the way, the characters must deal with creatures from the "Fiendish Incursion Encounters table" at the Singing Sands and with tyrannical giants from the "Storm Giant Encounters table" at the Forest Crystal (both tables are in "chapter 3").

Giants collect an eclectic assortment of treasures and trinkets over the course of their long life spans. This chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, explores treasures intrepid adventurers might find during their encounters with giants, focusing on the six main families of giants described in the "Monster Manual". This chapter contains the following sections:

""Giant Bags"" provides tables you can use to determine the contents—both valuable and mundane—of a roaming giant's bag.

""Relics of Giant Realms"" details the variety of valuable treasures left by ancient giants' civilizations.

""Magic Items"" presents new magic items associated with giants, their legends, and their magic runes.

## Giant Bags

Giants on the move carry colossal bags containing miscellaneous items collected over many years. Giant bags are strange repositories of unusual mementos, titanic tools, and giant-sized portions of food and drink. This section provides guidance for determining the contents of the bag of a giant of any kind.

Each of the lists in this section includes coinage (replacing the "Individual Treasure tables" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"), boulders for throwing, and a number of other nonmagical items determined by rolling on another table. These items can include valuable objects, as well as food, tools, and curiosities. At your discretion, any giant bag might also contain a [bag jelly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/bag-jelly-bgg.md) (described in "chapter 6").

### Cloud Giant Bags

Most cloud giant bags are sewn from richly dyed fabric and trimmed with gold. Giants who carry such bags thrive on showcasing the full extent of their wealth, and they often carry lavish items to further boast about their riches.

Other cloud giant bags are deceptive: they appear to be small and flat but abound with hidden pockets to stash all manner of items. Giants who carry such bags identify with the trickster aspect of the god Memnor and take pride in their cleverness.

### Fire Giant Bags

Fire giants include many skilled smiths, and some of them create gorgeous pieces from fired clay and blown glass.

Fire giants are often pragmatic, carrying only necessary tools and examples of their finest work. Their bags are sewn from resilient materials like thick leather, designed to withstand the heat of the forge as well as the fire giants' own searing heat.

### Frost Giant Bags

Frost giant bags are coated in waterproof lacquer and lined with thick fur to keep their contents dry in the harsh weather of the giants' arctic domains. In addition to weapons and travel supplies, frost giants like to carry trophies from their battles to boast about.

### Hill Giant Bags

The items found in hill giant bags reflect a diversity of taste and interest as broad as that found among any other giants. Some hill giants carry only food and boulders for throwing, while others collect artistic or scholarly materials that defy stereotypes attached to their kind.

Hill giant bags are made from simple materials like burlap or linen. Most have a distinctive "snack pocket"—a smaller compartment on the side of the bag used to store and easily access food while traveling. Food is of utmost importance to hill giants, and many carry different spices and cooking utensils with them.

### Stone Giant Bags

On a large scale, stone giants love elaborate murals and exquisite carvings. But when it comes to the trinkets in their bags, they favor trinkets that stimulate nonvisual senses, such as musical instruments, textured beads, and fragrant spices. However, many stone giants are fascinated by light and view it as a rare treasure. They cherish objects that generate or interact with light, such as prismatic crystals and bioluminescent flora.

### Storm Giant Bags

With their disposition toward divination, many storm giants are inclined to be superstitious, constantly searching the world for omens. They often carry a multitude of talismans and charms whose nature reflects the storm giant's home. A storm giant who lives in the sea might employ special kelp and shells for divination. A storm giant who spends more time in the sky might view lightning as a harbinger of good fortune and collect talismans made from objects struck by lightning or items that resemble lightning bolts.

## Relics of Giant Realms

Though their inhabitants may be long gone, the ruins of ancient giants' civilizations are littered with valuable treasure for adventurers to discover. The "random treasure" tables in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" can help you quickly generate items characters may find while exploring such ruins. If you want treasures that feel uniquely giant-themed, this section provides suggestions for more distinctive items.

This section can also be used to generate treasure found among still-thriving giant societies; such treasure may have been passed down between generations, created in the imitation of ancient styles, or unearthed by the giants themselves.

### Kinds of Treasure

Use these guidelines in conjunction with the information in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to detail treasures adventurers might find in ancient ruins built by giants.

#### Coins

Giants' civilizations minted coins using copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum. These coins were sized for the creatures that used them and are thus comparatively massive to the average adventurer. (Most coins found in giants' bags are ordinary coins minted by more recent civilizations.)

Giant-made coins vary in shape and design across civilizations, but in general, the coins are about 4 inches in diameter and at least 1/4-inch thick. Due to the sheer amount of precious metal used to make them, these coins are worth ten times more than their normal-sized counterparts. For example, one giant-sized copper coin is worth 10 cp (or 1 sp) and one giant-sized gold coin is worth 10 gp (or 1 pp).

Giant-made coins are also much heavier than normal coins. Five giant-sized coins of any type weigh 1 pound.

#### Gemstones

Jewels and other precious stones cut by smaller folk are too small for most giants to notice, let alone find value in. But ancient giants might have mastered ways of mining and cutting gemstones more appropriate to their size. They also harvested oversized pearls from giant clams.

You can use the ""Gemstones"" section of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to randomly generate different jewels adventurers might find while plundering a giant's hoard. A giant-cut gemstone is worth ten times its normal value; for example, a giant-cut garnet (a stone on the 100 gp Gemstones table in the "Dungeon Master's Guide") is worth 1,000 gp.

#### Art Objects

The art objects found in ancient giants' ruins reflect the societies and types of giants that once inhabited them. For example, ancient stone giant art is handsomely carved stonework, often adorned with tactile writing systems to accommodate visitors who aren't accustomed to the lightless depths such giants call home. Meanwhile, storm giant artwork reflects the variety of climes these giants inhabit, with thalassic treasures like pearls and seashells found alongside electroplated metals and jewelry charged with the might of a maelstrom.

In conjunction with the "tables" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide", you can use the following tables to generate distinctive, giant-sized art objects for a specific ruin or hoard belonging to giants.

## Magic Items

Giants have perfected numerous forms of magical crafting. This section presents new magic items associated with the might of giants.

### A Note about Size

"As described" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide", magic items meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. If your campaign features a lot of magic items made by giants, you might decide to tweak this rule. Consider these two options:

- **Everything Fits.** Perhaps the ancient giants of your world lived among creatures of varying statures, and as such, they took great care to ensure their magic items would resize to comfortably suit their users. With this option, any magic item created by giants (even one that is not worn, such as a wand or a weapon) magically resizes to suit any creature between Small and Huge size. The creature must spend 10 uninterrupted minutes touching the item and must attune to it if it requires attunement.  
- **Nothing Resizes.** Perhaps ancient giants made magic items to be used exclusively by giants. In this case, giant-made items don't resize. Smaller creatures might be able to adapt these items in various ways. A giant-made ring can be worn as a bracelet, a giant-made bracelet could serve as a headband, and so on. Some items can't be comfortably wielded by smaller creatures, but magical techniques might exist that allow skilled artisans to reshape and resize magic items with a few days of work.  

Some of the magic items described in this chapter have special properties that allow them to fit creatures of any size. For the rest, you can decide whether characters find giant-sized items they need to resize (one way or another) or they find items that were made by giants for smaller allies—or made by smaller creatures using giants' techniques.

> [!note]

> Giant-Crafted Items
> 
> Beyond its size, a giant-crafted version of a magic item might look different from its traditional appearance. For example, runes and rune carving are central to the magic traditions of the giants, so a [rod of rulership](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-rulership.md) created by a giant artisan might be inscribed with the king rune, while a giant-crafted [periapt of wound closure](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/periapt-of-wound-closure.md) might bear the life rune. Also, a magic item might absorb some of the latent elemental power of its giant users or creators. A [+1 longsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) forged by a fire giant, for example, could glow faintly like embers in the dark, while the [sentinel shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sentinel-shield.md) once carried by a frost giant could be perpetually cold to the touch.
> 
> None of these cosmetic effects alter a magic item's capabilities. They merely provide a narrative link to giants' realms that characters might explore.

# Chapter 1: Character Creation
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants, p. 11*

> One of my first encounters with giants was also the last thing I did at my old friend (and former foe) Mordenkainen's side. He claims to this day that no cleric was available to restore me to life, only a druid, but he can't hide his smirk when he says it.

Most adventurers have heard tales of giants and their ilk. But for some adventurers, their connection to giants runs deeper than fanciful stories.

This chapter is for any D&D character who aspires to forge a link to the mighty giants. From sources of havoc-wreaking power to the artful study of rune magic, from boons that imbue an individual with giant-like might to fantastic tales that can shape an adventurer's entire life—giants can make both big and small impacts on a character's story.

The following sections present a variety of options for creating characters with ties to giants:

""Subclass Option"" allows barbarians to explore ties to the nature of giants.

""Backgrounds"" presents two new backgrounds: the giant foundling and the rune carver. These backgrounds represent formative years spent studying and living among giants, and they grant access to feats that represent that experience.

""Big Heroes, Big Stories"" includes inspiration for narratively connecting characters to giants, regardless of their class or background.

""Feats"" provides options for players who wish to link their characters to giants and primordial magic.

## Subclass Option

This section presents one new subclass option: the [Path of the Giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-giant-bgg.md) for the barbarian.

![Halfling Path of the Giant Barbarian](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/bigby-presents-glory-of-the-giants/img/023-01-002-halfling-barbarian.webp#center)

## Backgrounds

This section presents two backgrounds that provide options linking characters to the ancient magic of giants. The [giant foundling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/giant-foundling-bgg.md) background represents a life spent around titanic creatures and their supernatural might. The [rune carver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/rune-carver-bgg.md) background reflects a history of studying the ancient traditions of giants' runecraft.

### Bonus Feats

If the DM decides to allow the giant foundling and rune carver backgrounds, all characters in the campaign gain access to a bonus feat. If you select one of those backgrounds, you gain the bonus feat specified in that background. If the background you choose doesn't provide a feat, you gain a bonus feat of your choice from the following list (these feats appear in the "Player's Handbook"):

- [Skilled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/skilled.md)  
- [Tough](/3-Mechanics/CLI/feats/tough.md)  

## Big Heroes, Big Stories

The remnants of giants' power, ancient and strong, echo throughout the worlds, touching the lives of individuals regardless of their background. This section provides various ways to narratively tie your character to the myth and might of giants.

### Heroes of the Giants

Barbarians who harness the might of giants are not the only adventurers who draw power from giants. A character of any class can explore ties to giants in the following ways.

#### Elements and Environments

If your spells or class features draw on elemental forces or the magic of the land, you might use a connection to giants to tap into that power. A druid belonging to the [Circle of the Land](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md) might feel a connection to the giants who inhabit that land. A monk who follows the [Way of the Four Elements](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/monk-way-of-the-four-elements.md) might seek to emulate Annam, the All-Father, to shape and channel the forces of the Elemental Chaos.

#### Giant Ancestors

You might be distantly descended from giants and manifest the power of your ancestors in your class features or magic, which might explain your Rage as a barbarian or your spellcasting as a sorcerer.

#### Giant Foes

Your character's relationship to giants might be defined by animosity. You could choose class features specifically to target giants or all creatures with the Giant type, or you could write enmity toward giants into the tenets of your paladin's Sacred Oath.

#### Giant Lore

You might have learned magic, martial techniques, or other secrets from studying giants, either ancient or living. Your character might strive to unearth and record more of the ancient history of giants or to learn more of their present ways. This could be a matter of personal motivation, but it also might explain some of your class features or magic. A bard of the [College of Lore](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard-college-of-lore.md) might focus on the study of giants, a [Rune Knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-rune-knight-tce.md) fighter (from "Tasha's Cauldron of Everything") might use the magic of Giant runes, or a paladin's Sacred Oath could involve allegiance to the tenets of a philosophy or organization of giants (such as those described in "chapter 2").

#### Giant-Made Accessories

You might use a giant-crafted item—probably something inscribed with one or more Giant runes—as a spellcasting focus. For example, the staff you wield as an arcane focus might have been a giant's wand. Your wizard's spellbook might be a relic from an ancient realm of giants, perhaps a large and heavy tome mostly written in the Giant language. Or you might wield a weapon that a giant intended for a different use, such as a giant's letter opener that works as a sword or a giant's hatchet that serves you as a greataxe. Perhaps you have learned to play a giant's violin as if it were a cello or use a musical instrument made for a giant child.

#### Gods of the Giants

Your character might worship one of the gods described in "chapter 2". If you were reared by giants, they might have taught you their faith. Perhaps one of those gods called you to fulfill a specific purpose. Alternatively, you could worship one of the so-called "interloper gods" (also described in "chapter 2") who often take an interest in giants, or one of those entities might be your warlock's Otherworldly Patron.

#### Mentors and Patrons

Perhaps you had a giant as a mentor or a financial benefactor who taught you your profession or your class or provided you with your starting equipment. If you have a continuing obligation to this giant, see ""Giant Patrons"" in "chapter 3" for additional inspiration.

#### Primeval Animals

You could have a connection with giant-sized or prehistoric animals. You might call on the spirits of cave bears, dire wolves, or eagle-eyed pteranodons, or you might use your magic to take the shapes of such creatures. Or you could have a dinosaur companion.

### Birthplaces and Hometowns

Your character might hail from a location steeped in giants' history and primordial magic. From ancient ruins to underground caverns to elemental nexuses, this section provides various locales to tie to your character's backstory.

#### Ancient Giant Ruins

You grew up amid the ruins of one of the giants' civilizations. Perhaps the history of your home settlement is well-known, with lauded scholars traveling to the site to conduct archaeological research. Or maybe its origins are a mystery, your only clues being the strange, oversized objects occasionally found in the nearby land.

##### Giant Trinket

While exploring your home, you discovered some trivial remnant of the ancient inhabitants, as determined by rolling on the Giant Trinkets table. The items in parentheses are the normal-sized objects most analogous to the described giant trinkets.

#### Primordial Nexus

You grew up surrounded by powerful elemental magic. Maybe you lived in a place where the border between the Material Plane and an Elemental Plane was thin. Or perhaps you spent your formative years traversing the Elemental Planes as a merchant or scholar, visiting fantastic locations such as the City of Brass on the Plane of Fire or the Labyrinth Winds of the Plane of Air.

In any case, your time spent among these elemental forces deeply affected you. The Material Plane feels mundane and controlled, especially when you have experienced firsthand the churning chaos of the primordial elements.

##### Elemental Mark

Your exposure to primordial elemental magic has altered you physically in some small way, determined by rolling on the Elemental Marks table.

![Elemental Marks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/elemental-marks-bgg.md)

#### Sequestered Caverns

You spent your formative years deep beneath the ground, sequestered far from the sun and wind of the surface.

You may have encountered giants during your time underground—particularly families of gentle stone giants or talented smithing guilds of fire giants. To you, the surface world is just a long-forgotten memory or distant dream.

##### Underground Quirk

Your time spent underground has changed you in some way, as determined by rolling on the Underground Quirks table.

![Underground Quirks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/underground-quirks-bgg.md)

### Tall Tales

Some folks are content to merely listen to stories of giants and other enormous peoples and creatures. For others, these tall tales become the basis of their entire adventuring career. Such individuals find themselves gripped by legends of giants, spurred to embark on dangerous quests in search of truth or vindication.

Myths about giants vary across the worlds. The Tall Tales table provides ideas for legends of—or encounters with—giant creatures that may have inspired your character to begin adventuring.

# Chapter 3: Balance
*Source: The Book of Many Things* 

Dice are a reliable way to randomize a variety of gameplay elements. Throughout its history, Dungeons & Dragons has relied on dice to do everything from creating encounters with wandering monsters to inspiring whole adventures. But [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set and other card decks provide an alternative way to get random results. How is drawing from a deck of cards different from rolling dice? And how can Dungeon Masters make interesting use of those differences?

This chapter addresses some of the unique randomizing elements cards can provide, even for a game that already has iconic random number generators close at hand.

## Advantages of Using Cards

Whether you're using [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set, oracle cards like tarokka cards or tarot cards, or a deck of playing cards, you can do things with cards that would be difficult or even impossible to do using dice:

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/007-02-001-balance.webp#center)

- **Archetypes and Imagery.** When interpreting [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set and oracle cards, you can lean on the cards' imagery, not just numbers and words. A card's artwork can generate meaning for that card beyond whatever this book or any other text might tell you it means. Cards from Magic: The Gathering (https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random) also work well for inspiration since they feature amazing fantasy art in addition to symbols. Ordinary playing cards' suits, one-eyed jacks, and other markings can be assigned additional meanings.  
- **Choose from a Hand.** Many card games rely on dealing hands of cards. You can use hands to represent a limited set of options in a situation, such as possible leads to pursue or actions to take. This is a fun way to offer players choices without overwhelming them with too many options.  
- **Customizable Results.** Drawing from a deck of cards is equivalent to rolling on a table of possible results. But when using cards, it's easy to prevent any undesired results: simply leave those cards out of the deck.  
- **Eliminate Repetition.** You can prevent repetition in a deck by removing cards once they've been drawn.  
- **Position and Orientation.** You can assign meaning to a card's position or orientation in addition to its numeric or symbolic value. For example, in a tarot card spread, each card's intrinsic meaning changes depending on whether that card is upright or reversed (top oriented downward), or where it lies in relation to other cards in a spread.  
- **Stacked Deck.** You can ensure certain outcomes by stacking the deck with cards placed in a specific order. If you have duplicates of your cards, you can use multiple copies to make a given card more likely to be drawn.  
- **Unusual Numbers.** Using cards instead of dice allows you to choose from a set number of options that doesn't correspond to the number of sides on a typical die or combination of dice, such as odd numbers of options.

The rest of this chapter is devoted to examples of how you can use these properties of cards to enrich your D&D game. If you're interested in further possibilities, the reference book that accompanies [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set also presents a method for using the deck to generate adventures, as well as advice on using them for in-game fortune-telling.

## Card Sparks

You can use the visual elements of cards as a quick source of inspiration. Here are three methods to spark your imagination.

### Quick Nonplayer Characters

When you need to create a nonplayer character, draw a card and let it inspire distinctive features of the NPC. For example, if the card depicts a person, the NPC might resemble that person. If the card features symbols, perhaps the NPC's clothing or jewelry incorporates those symbols. If the card has a divinatory meaning, that meaning could inform the NPC's name, personality, or goals.

### Idea Decks

Consider building multiple custom decks to keep on hand for quick inspiration. Depending on the cards you have available, you might build decks of specific characters, creatures, events, spells, treasures, or anything else you need.

### Filler Scenes

Use cards to fill in the narrative of your game. For example, you might ask each player to draw a card at the beginning of the session; then, you or the player (or both of you working together) can use those cards as brainstorming material, setting the scene at the start of the session or describing an event that occurred during a period of downtime between adventures. Alternatively, you can draw cards during the session to help you generate story beats during an ongoing adventure.

## Inspiration Hand

You can use [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set (or an equivalent deck built from twenty-two playing cards) to give players alternative ways to use inspiration.

Draw a number of cards equal to the number of players and place the cards face up on the table where everyone can see them. Whenever a player gains inspiration, they must pick a card and later use the effect shown on the Inspiration Cards table at the appropriate time. The player then draws a new card for the communal hand and shuffles the used card into the deck.

**Inspiration Cards**

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Balance (or 2 ♠) | When you deal damage to a creature, immediately spend 1 Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum 1). |
| Comet (or 2 ♦) | As a bonus action, select one creature as your chosen foe. That creature has vulnerability to damage you deal and resistance to all other damage, and it has disadvantage on its attack rolls against any creature other than you. This effect ends when any creature other than you deals damage to the target. |
| Donjon (or A ♠) | As an action, you are transported to an empty demiplane until the end of your next turn. You can't affect or be affected by anything on the plane you left until you return. You return to the same space you left or, if that space is occupied, to the nearest unoccupied space. |
| Euryale (or Q ♠) | When a creature makes a saving throw, it has disadvantage on that saving throw. |
| Fates (or A ♥) | Reroll a single `d20` roll you've just made. You must use the second roll. |
| Flames (or Q ♣) | When you deal damage to a creature, that creature takes an extra `1d6` fire damage. |
| Fool (or Joker with ™) | As a reaction, when you take damage, you cause the creature that dealt it to have the [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. |
| Gem (or 2 ♥) | Take an additional action on your turn. |
| Jester (or Joker without ™) | Take the [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action as a bonus action. |
| Key (or Q ♥) | As a bonus action, teleport, with anything you are wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to a space you can see. |
| Knight (or J ♥) | As a reaction, impose disadvantage on the attack roll of a creature you can see. |
| Moon (or Q ♦) | As a bonus action, regain one expended 1st-level spell slot or a single use of an ability that can be used a certain number of times per day. |
| Puzzle (or 2 ♣) | Gain advantage on a saving throw. |
| Rogue (or J ♠) | Gain advantage on an attack roll. |
| Ruin (or K ♠) | As a bonus action, impose disadvantage on all ability checks of a creature you can see until the end of its next turn. |
| Sage (or A ♦) | Take the [Help](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Help) or [Search](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Search) action as a bonus action. |
| Skull (or J ♣) | As an action, surround yourself with a shroud of death. Until the start of your next turn, any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you takes `1d6` necrotic damage. |
| Star (or J ♦) | Gain advantage on an ability check. |
| Sun (or K ♦) | As a reaction, when a creature makes a melee attack that hits you, that creature has the [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) condition until the end of your next turn. |
| Talons (or A ♣) | As a bonus action, reduce the speed of one creature within 5 feet of you to 0 until the start of your next turn. |
| Throne (or K ♥) | As a reaction, when you take damage, the creature that dealt the damage has the [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition until the end of its next turn. You are the source of its fear. |
| Void (or K ♣) | As a reaction, when you take damage, gain resistance to that damage until the start of your next turn. |

### Inspiration for the DM

Another way to use the inspiration deck is to make its effects available to monsters and villains. In this variant, each time a player expends inspiration, the DM also draws a card from the deck. Rather than adding it to the communal hand, you keep that card secret until you play it on behalf of one of the characters' opponents.

You can play your inspiration cards soon after drawing them or save them for use in major encounters. Note that saving your cards might make players more reluctant to use inspiration, worrying they need to conserve it for later encounters. Your players are likely to follow your example, so if you want them to use their inspiration cards freely, you should do so as well.

## Journey Spread

The journey spread is a means of making long journeys more interesting. In this method, you place cards in a particular arrangement (a spread) and interpret them based on their meaning, position, and orientation. You can use [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set, tarokka cards, a tarot deck, or any other cards you can readily assign symbolic meanings to. This method works best for a journey you expect to last at least as many days as you have players.

You can improvise encounters, other challenges, and rewards based on cards as they're revealed, or you can build a small deck in advance with fewer cards, then prepare notes on possible encounters and rewards based on your chosen cards.

For each day of the journey, lay out two cards face down, one overlapping the other, to form a journey spread (see diagram 3.1). This gives everyone at the table a visual representation of the journey and the characters' progress toward their destination.

> ![Day 3](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/011-02-004-diagram-3-1.webp#gallery)

### Top Card: The Challenge

At the beginning of each day of a journey, a player flips over the top card to determine what happens that day. (Players should take turns at this.) Use that card's imagery or symbolic meaning to inspire a choice or challenge the characters will face that day. The card could represent a site the characters come across on their journey, like a ruined tower or a fork in the road, or a situation the characters are asked to resolve. You decide the scope of the decision the characters must make. You can ask them to make a simple choice ("Do you want to take the path along the edge of the cliff or climb down the ravine to walk along the bottom?"), to make a single ability check (use the [Typical DCs table](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/difficulty-class-typical-dcs.md) in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"), or to navigate their way through a small dungeon or an encounter (which might involve multiple ability checks or even combat). Let the character of the player who flipped the card be the focus of the day's events and make any required ability checks (though another character can help, at your discretion).

Whatever choice or challenge you decide the top card represents, the characters' success or failure while dealing with that situation determines how you read the bottom card.

### Bottom Card: Reward or Ruin

Once the situation presented by the top card has been resolved, the player can flip over the bottom card. Then it's up to you to interpret that card as either a reward or a ruin based on how well the players resolved the day's top card. If you're using cards that have a different meaning when they're upright versus upside down, ignore the cards' orientation.

#### Rewards

When determining rewards, here are some effects to consider:

- **Friendly Aid.** The characters encounter another traveler or a friendly local resident who offers them food, shelter, information, or other assistance. The card can inspire both the characteristics of the person they meet and the nature of the aid that person provides.  
- **Ready Foraging.** The characters have abundant food and water for this day and don't need to consume any of their rations. They eat well that night, and each character begins the next day with inspiration.  
- **Reduced Travel Time.** The characters find a shortcut that reduces the time needed to reach their destination by a day. Remove the last pair of cards from the spread.  
- **Treasure.** The characters find treasure inspired by the card as they overcome the day's challenges. If the card doesn't seem appropriate, use the "treasure tables" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to determine the treasure instead.  

#### Ruins

When determining ruins, the following effects are broadly appropriate:

- **Encounter.** The characters' failure leads to a difficult combat encounter. Use the card to help you decide what kind of creature is encountered.  
- **Exhaustion.** The stress of overcoming the challenge exhausts the characters. Each character gains 2 levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).  
- **Extra Travel Time.** The characters' journey is extended by 1 day. Use the card, as well as the circumstances of the challenge, to narrate this setback: perhaps the characters became lost in the woods or encountered an obstacle blocking their path. Add two more cards to the spread.  
- **Lost Gear.** The characters lose their rations or are unable to forage for food and water. Alternatively, they might lose nonmagical equipment, such as a bedroll, a tent, or a pack animal.  
- **Restless Night.** The characters are unable to finish a long rest before resuming their travels the next day.  

### Journey Spread Example

Here is an example of how you might interpret cards from [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set in a journey spread, with interpretations informed by the card descriptions in the reference book:

- **Day 1 Challenge.** Sage (Upright). The Sage card suggests an opportunity to gain insight or advice. Perhaps the characters come to a promontory that allows them to see the surrounding terrain for many miles. Ask the character who flipped the card to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to choose the best path.  
- **Day 1 Reward or Ruin.** Comet. Comets are harbingers of doom. If the character succeeds on the Wisdom check and chooses the better path, the characters' travel time decreases by a day, but their path is lined with omens that foretell terrible events when they reach their destination. If the character fails the Wisdom check and picks the worse path, the characters are troubled by nightmares that portend a disastrous future, preventing them from finishing a long rest that night.  
- **Day 2 Challenge.** Jester (Reversed). When reversed, this card can represent misfortunes piling up in a way that might be humorous if it weren't so disastrous. Imagine the worst possible day of hiking through the wilderness, and describe the litany of horrors the characters face: biting insects and leeches, a sudden rainstorm making a river impassible, a broken backpack strap, lost or moldy rations, blistered feet, sunburn once the rain has cleared, and so on. For each hindrance you devise, have one character (starting with the character of the player who flipped the card, then rotating through the party) make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.  
- **Day 2 Reward or Ruin.** Fool. If the characters succeed on the majority of these saving throws, they stumble across a treasure: a [Hat of Disguise](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hat-of-disguise.md) or a similar item used to fool or deceive. The reversed Fool card implies disappointment or lost innocence; if they fail most of the saving throws, they gain 2 levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).  
- **Day 3 Challenge.** Donjon (Upright). This card can describe literal or metaphorical imprisonment. Perhaps the characters happen upon an eccentric's zoo, where monstrous animals are held in cruel captivity. The characters might decide to avoid the place entirely. Or they could free the monsters—hopefully avoiding the hungry ones—and confront the zoo's enraged owner.  
- **Day 3 Reward or Ruin.** Gem. If the characters overcome the challenges of the menagerie, they discover valuable treasures there; if not, they must face one additional trap or monster that uses the appearance of treasure as bait, such as a [mimic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md).  

## Encounter Deck

Using cards to generate random encounters is a dynamic alternative to rolling on encounter tables. You can customize an encounter deck and remove cards as you draw them so they don't repeat. You can also alter the encounter deck as characters explore an area, adding cards to the deck to reflect changing circumstances and weaving the encounters into a narrative.

The following system is derived from *Miniatures Handbook* (2003).

### How It Works

Construct a deck of about twenty cards that each represent a creature (see the "Constructing Your Deck" section below). When an encounter occurs, shuffle the deck and draw a number of cards equal to the number of characters in the party. Use one or more of these cards to build the encounter, using the guidelines in the "Choosing Monsters" section below. When the encounter is over, discard the cards of any monsters that were killed, so they won't be drawn again.

### Constructing Your Deck

An encounter deck consists primarily of cards representing monsters. You can use cards from [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set, oracle cards, playing cards, cards from Magic: The Gathering (https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random), or even index cards with your handwritten notes. Any kind of card works as long as each card can correlate with a specific monster. You can also add special cards for unusual events, as detailed below.

#### Choosing Monsters

Choose ten to fifteen monsters with challenge ratings ranging from about half the level of the characters to 2 higher than their level. Usually you should include only one of the most powerful monsters, and you can include multiple copies of weaker monsters so they're more likely to be encountered.

##### Groups

A group is a collection of creatures that might be encountered together. Identical creatures always form a group, but you can also form groups using other criteria. A group might be based on a shared creature type, such as Undead or Fiend, or might consist of creatures that often work together, such as gnolls and [hyenas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hyena.md). Whenever you draw two or more creature cards of the same group for an encounter, those creatures work together against the party.

Not all creatures need to belong to groups. You can add as many unaffiliated creatures as you like to your encounter deck. Create groups depending on how you'd like the characters to encounter the creatures.

##### Multiples

You can also designate single cards to represent two, three, or four creatures instead of just one. This ensures weak creatures appear in numbers sufficient to challenge the party without being overrepresented in the deck.

#### Special Cards

You can include special cards in your encounter deck to add twists to encounters, such as surprise allies, additional adversaries, or goals the adventurers must accomplish. If you include special cards, a typical encounter deck of about twenty monster cards should also include three or four special cards.

##### Friend Card

A friend is a creature that helps the characters fight the other creatures in an encounter. The friend might be the sole survivor of another adventuring party, a solitary traveler or recluse, or a benevolent monster like a [flumph](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/flumph.md) or an angel. The friend might have information about the adventure location or the creatures that dwell there.

When you draw a friend, set it aside. Then draw two additional cards and determine which foes the characters will face. The friend appears in the encounter with the other creatures, fighting on the side of the characters; you can let the players determine what the friend does on each of its turns.

A friend's challenge rating should be 1 or 2 lower than the level of the characters.

> [!quote]- A quote from Asteria  
> 
> Flumphs are always friend-shaped.

##### Lurker Card

A lurker is a sneaky, wandering opportunist that attacks the adventurers while they're fighting other creatures.

When you draw a lurker card, set it aside and determine what foes the characters will face as normal. The lurker appears in the encounter separate from the other monsters, as far from the characters as reasonably possible and hiding if it can, attacking once the characters are distracted.

Lurkers might include Humanoid foes like bandits, as well as ambush predators such as [violet fungi](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/violet-fungus-dosi.md), [ropers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md), and [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md).

##### Twin Card

Twin creatures only appear together, though they need not be the same kind of creature.

If you draw both twin cards when an encounter occurs, the twin creatures appear in the encounter. If you draw only one twin card, shuffle it back into the deck and form the encounter as normal.

The twins could be a pair of [displacer beasts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) or a [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) with two pet [hell hounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md) (with the two hell hounds represented by a single card). Because you're more likely to draw both twin cards when the encounter deck has thinned out, the twin encounter should make for a climactic battle. Each twin should have a challenge rating about equal to the characters' level.

![A pair of displacer beasts...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/012-02-005-displacer-beasts.webp#center "A pair of displacer beasts in a dark forest has the makings of a memorable encounter")

##### "Draw Two" Card

When you draw this card, discard it and draw two more. Don't return this card to the deck. You can also include a "draw three" card or even a "draw four" card.

##### Noncombat Encounter Cards

You can add cards to represent creatures you don't expect the characters to fight, such as a peaceful [stegosaurus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stegosaurus-mpmm.md), or scenes the characters might find, like a mysterious statue. When you draw one of these cards, decide whether to use it as the encounter or to build an encounter using the remaining cards.

##### Goal Cards

You can also include one or more cards in an encounter deck to represent goals for the characters as they explore a region. For example, a goal card might represent an ancient ruin the characters are seeking. When that card appears, the adventurers find the site. A goal card could also represent a creature the characters are searching for.

You don't want a goal to show up right away. If you draw a goal card earlier than you want, give the adventurers only a hint of the goal's presence: perhaps the monsters they encounter are hunting the same creature, and its tracks can still be found. Or the encounter might take place within an ancient construction similar to the ruin they're searching for. Draw a replacement for the goal card, and shuffle the goal card into the deck. You might allow the goal to elude the characters twice before they finally reach it.

Another way to handle a goal is to omit the goal card from the deck at the beginning of the session and shuffle it in when the characters reach a particular milestone. For example, suppose the goal is to defeat a [gnoll fang of Yeenoghu](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-fang-of-yeenoghu.md) responsible for raiding nearby villages. There might be four ordinary [gnolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) (minions of the fang of Yeenoghu) in the encounter deck. Once the characters have killed three of the minions, shuffle the goal card in. That way, the characters always meet the minions first.

The goal card might also be one of a pair of twin cards, which both increases the chance that characters will find it later in their exploration and ensures that a specific creature (the other twin card) is always encountered with the goal.

### Evolving the Encounter Deck

Evolving your encounter deck fosters a sense of progress, creating a rough narrative arc as the adventurers explore an area. You can evolve the deck to make encounters progressively harder, or you can change the flavor of encounters, such as adding creatures from a particular environment.

One way to accomplish this is to build two encounter decks. Draw cards from the first encounter deck, and when you remove cards from that deck, replace those cards with an equal number of random cards from the second deck. This method is particularly effective if the second deck has a markedly different theme. You might start with an encounter deck featuring mostly dungeon scavengers, like [rats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/rat.md) and [carrion crawlers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/carrion-crawler.md), then slowly add in cards from a deck made up of Undead creatures and cultists.

Alternatively, you can use special cards such as noncombat encounter cards to tell you when to begin shuffling in cards from the second deck. For example, adventurers exploring a sylvan woodland might encounter mostly elves and Fey, but you might include a noncombat encounter card representing the party's discovery of a scorched clearing. After that encounter, you can start shuffling in cards representing gnolls and [hyenas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hyena.md)—the cause of the destruction.

If you have a goal card (see the ""Special Cards"" section above), you don't want the adventurers to reach the goal too early; don't put that card into the deck until the characters defeat one or more creatures from the second deck. At that point, shuffle the goal card into the second deck.

### Sample Encounter Decks

These sample decks, best suited for 4th- to 6th-level characters, feature monsters from the "Monster Manual" and "Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse". If you don't have "Monsters of the Multiverse", omit those cards from the deck.

Entries with a multiplication sign indicate that the card represents multiple monsters. Monsters in the same group are assigned cards with the same face value (for example, all bandits are represented by king cards), but not all monsters with the same value are a group (the [owlbears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md), for example, hunt alone). This makes it easier to see when you've drawn multiple cards that form an encounter.

You can use these decks as examples for building your own. You can use them separately when the characters are traveling through suitable terrain, or you can combine them (see ""Evolving the Encounter Deck"" above), so characters who are exploring a forest (using the forest encounter deck) slowly discover the vile demonic influence corrupting the place as you shuffle in cards from the corrupted lands encounter deck.

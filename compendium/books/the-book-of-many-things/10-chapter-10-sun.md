# Chapter 10: Sun
*Source: The Book of Many Things* 

This chapter details the Solar Bastion, a benevolent organization that protects the multiverse from the chaos wrought by the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). The chapter includes a description of the organization and a map of its headquarters. It also explores how DMs can introduce the Solar Bastion to their campaigns, and how characters might join the Solar Bastion or otherwise become entangled in the group's operations across the multiverse.

## The Solar Bastion

The Solar Bastion is an elite organization with extensive resources and a benevolent agenda. Its members style themselves as knights, though the organization doesn't grant them noble titles.

Founded by Hilarion, a solar angel, the Solar Bastion uses the sun as its symbol. Typically, this symbol is styled to evoke the Sun card in a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md), reflecting both the knights' origin and their mission in the multiverse. Sometimes knights wear this symbol openly on their gear, but more often they keep a sun-shaped pin hidden under a collar or lapel or carry a nonmagical copy of the Sun card to identify their allegiance when necessary.

### Goals

The Solar Bastion monitors the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) in all its manifestations throughout the multiverse, warns and protects those who find it, and minimizes the damage it causes when found. Knights of the Solar Bastion also strive to protect people from other dangerous magic, such as cursed magic items and evil artifacts. The knights often provide aid with all sorts of magical mishaps, hauntings, and monstrous infestations.

The Solar Bastion has hundreds of members and a vast fortune, but its mission spans the multiverse, so its resources are constantly stretched thin; the Solar Bastion welcomes assistance from adventurers sympathetic to its goals.

#### Monitor the Deck

Most of the Solar Bastion's activity revolves around monitoring *Decks of Many Things*. The knights strive for the following goals in their pursuit of that effort:

- **Provide Aid and Counsel.** When they find a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md), in the hands of hapless mortals, knights of the Solar Bastion do everything they can to warn and assist the deck's owners. They make sure the owners understand the rules of drawing cards, the wide range of possible effects, and the dangers of keeping a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) long enough to draw the Grim Harrow's attention (the Grim Harrow is detailed in "chapter 19").  
- **Research the Deck of Many Things.** When they aren't actively pursuing copies of the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md), knights of the Solar Bastion try to learn all they can about the origin and purpose of the cards. They know much of the deck's history (as described in "chapter 2"), including multiple contradictory accounts of its creation. Sorting through the conflicting legends and determining the truth about the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) is a cherished goal, but not one that most members of the group have any real hope of achieving.  
- **Track Rifflers.** The Solar Bastion knows that Fey called [rifflers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/riffler-bmt.md) (see "chapter 21") often manipulate events to put Decks of Many Things into the hands of mortals. Thus, one way to monitor the location of the cards is to keep track of rifflers. Knights of the Solar Bastion use divination magic to find and spy on these creatures, though the knights directly interfere only if it's clear the rifflers have a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) in their possession.  
- **Warn of the Grim Harrow.** The Solar Bastion is on the lookout for the Grim Harrow: Undead that pursue Decks of Many Things across the multiverse (see "chapter 19"). Knights of the Solar Bastion try to reach those who come into possession of a deck before the Grim Harrow does, to warn them of the threat the Undead present. They also sometimes take action against the Grim Harrow, but they know they're no match for the leaders of that organization.  
- **Find Asteria Again.** Hilarion, the Solar Bastion's leader, encountered [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) (see "chapter 22") once when she infiltrated the organization's headquarters, and the angel managed to learn some of what [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) knows about the deck's origins. Convinced that she is key to learning the truth about the deck, the organization seeks [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) across the multiverse.  
- **Prevent the Deck's Misuse.** As a rule, knights of the Solar Bastion don't use force to wrest Decks of Many Things from those who possess them. However, they may break this rule if they discern that a deck's owner plans to use it for an evil or destructive purpose. In particular, they oppose the efforts of the Heralds of the Comet (described in "chapter 12"), who seek to use the original [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) to destroy the multiverse.  

#### Combat Curses and Wicked Magic

*Decks of Many Things* are notoriously resistant to divination magic that would reveal their locations, so knights travel widely in pursuit of even faint leads. Inevitably, many of these leads turn out to be the effects of curses and corrupt magic. Rather than ignore these situations, knights endeavor to protect those affected by curses, destroy cursed magic items, and contain evil and destructive artifacts so they can't cause further harm or be used for wicked ends.

The Solar Bastion's headquarters has a vault that holds at least one evil artifact the organization was unable to destroy, hiding it so it can't be put to evil use (which artifact this might be is up to you). Knowledge of the vault's location and contents is restricted to Hilarion, the Solar Bastion's leader.

### Membership

Knights of the Solar Bastion are battle-hardened veterans who operate independently across the multiverse. When word reaches the organization that a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) has appeared, the nearest knight investigates, but every knight has the magical means to contact the Solar Bastion's headquarters and request help. Even so, it's rare for knights to work together outside their headquarters.

#### Recruitment

As they travel across the multiverse, knights of the Solar Bastion frequently encounter other individuals whose goals and interests align with their own. These encounters offer opportunities for adventurers to become involved with the work of the Solar Bastion or even become knights themselves.

Because the knights' resources are spread thin, the Solar Bastion welcomes assistance. A knight might recruit help for a mission that's too difficult to handle alone, but more often a knight opportunistically joins forces with adventurers, offering help with the party's efforts as long as their goals align. Often, the adventurers in these arrangements have no knowledge of the knight's true allegiance, and the knight rarely explains the Solar Bastion's purpose unless that information is relevant.

Characters who prove themselves competent and good-hearted might earn an invitation to become knights themselves. If the characters express interest, the knight brings them to the Solar Bastion headquarters. The only requirement for becoming a knight is swearing an oath to the knights' leader, promising to uphold the organization's goals.

Occasionally, knights of the Solar Bastion take in orphaned children and people in similarly desperate situations. These people might become squires to the knights, accompanying them on adventures and learning the order's ways, although Hilarion discourages this practice, preferring to see such folk returned to stable circumstances. Squires who prove their worth can count on being accepted as knights.

In addition to the knights who actively pursue the goals of the Solar Bastion, the order's eponymous headquarters is staffed with a variety of scholars, researchers, diviners, and retired knights who train active members.

#### Leadership

The founder and sole leader of the Solar Bastion is a neutral good [solar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/solar.md) angel named Hilarion. Hilarion was once the trusted lieutenant of a lawful good deity, and when a mighty cleric of that deity drew the Void card from a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md), Hilarion led the effort to retrieve and restore the cleric's soul. The quest proved so harrowing that Hilarion's faith eroded, and when the quest was complete, the angel chose to establish the Solar Bastion rather than return to his god's service.

A powerful and immortal Celestial, Hilarion sees no reason for additional tiers of leadership in the organization. All members of the Solar Bastion report directly to him, and the knights are largely self-directed in choosing missions. Hilarion and the rest of the organization represent a pool of resources knights can draw upon during their missions, rather than a top-down leadership structure. In Hilarion's view, the goals of the organization are most important, not personal loyalty to him or obeying his rules.

That said, the knights of the Solar Bastion recognize the value of wisdom and experience. They respect the oldest knights' authority, whether those knights are active or retirees who serve as trainers in the citadel. No formal hierarchy confers authority on these knight-elders, but in practice they wield significant influence over less experienced knights.

### Solar Bastion Knight

The [Solar Bastion knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/solar-bastion-knight-bmt.md) presented here is an example member of the organization.

Customize this stat block to suit individual knights and differentiate them from each other. For example, knights who track the Grim Harrow through the multiverse might resemble rangers instead of paladins.

In addition, "Sir Jared", detailed at the end of the chapter, can serve as a model for knights with a lower challenge rating.

### Headquarters

The Solar Bastion's eponymous headquarters is a fortified town built on a metal disk that orbits close to a small sun in a little-known reach of the Material Plane. The face of the disk on which the Solar Bastion is built faces the sun, so the sun is always high in the sky above it.

Map 10.1 shows the major features of the Solar Bastion, including the following locations.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/055-map-9-01-solar-bastion-player.webp#gallery)

#### Dome of the Sun

Hilarion's residence is a gleaming white dome that suggests both a lofty temple and a majestic palace in its architecture and furnishings. Sun shines through a circular window in the top of the dome, and Hilarion can usually be found seated on a throne beneath that shaft of sunlight.

A permanent teleportation circle is inscribed in the floor before the throne, allowing anyone who knows the circle's sigil sequence and the [Teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md) or [Teleportation Circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spell to teleport directly to the dome. The throne also allows anyone seated on it to cast the [Sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell using the throne. Hilarion uses this feature to communicate with knights across the multiverse, but the angel allows knights or even some visitors to use this magic.

The Dome of the Sun is said to have a hidden vault beneath it. One or more evil artifacts are rumored to be stashed in this vault to keep them from being used for malevolent ends. It's generally believed that Hilarion is the only being who knows how to access the vault, but knights of the Solar Bastion suspect traps, other angels, or perhaps heavenly Constructs protect the vault as well.

#### Towers of Day

Seven tall watchtowers ring the edge of the Solar Bastion. In addition to offering a clear view of the entire fortress, the towers are equipped with magical devices that give their sentries the ability to detect threats approaching the bastion and even to peer into other planes of existence. Knights of the Solar Bastion usually stay in one of the Towers of Day while visiting the fortress, and while they're there, they also serve as sentries. Each tower typically holds at most a few such visiting sentries as well as a captain, usually an older knight retired from field duty who resides there permanently. Over time, the captains have customized their towers to suit their personal hobbies and research interests.

##### North Tower

The tower nearest the Dome of the Sun is imbued with magic that makes it serve as a sort of north pole for the fortress. Compasses point toward that tower, giving those in the bastion a common reference for cardinal directions.

#### Spelljammer Harbor

A docking area in the southeast part of the Solar Bastion offers a place for spacefaring spelljamming vessels to moor (see "Spelljammer: Adventures in Space" for more information about travel through space). Hilarion keeps a wasp ship—a lightweight spelljamming vessel that can be crewed by as few as five sailors—in the harbor, but there's room for a few more vessels depending on their size. Knights sometimes borrow Hilarion's vessel to pursue rumors concerning a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) when teleportation isn't a safe option. Knights who have spelljamming vessels of their own also dock them here when visiting the Solar Bastion, but the docks are seldom full.

#### Training Yard

In the center of the Solar Bastion is a large training yard where visiting knights hone their combat and magical skills. They mostly fight against each other under the watchful eyes of retired knights, but occasionally a knight brings a particularly horrific monster—typically a powerful evil Undead or Aberration—to the fortress so knights can work together to learn how to defeat it.

#### Library Tower

Across the Solar Bastion from the Dome of the Sun, the graceful spire of the Library Tower rises higher than the Towers of Day. Inside the library, a ramp winds up from the ground floor through vast ranks of shelves holding tomes, scrolls, and other repositories of learning. Scribes and scholars tend the place, sorting and indexing the volumes while making copies of particularly valuable resources. A tremendous amount of lore concerning *Decks of Many Things* is stored in this tower, much of it annotated by scholars attempting to sift fact from legend.

#### Artisans and Services

The Solar Bastion attracts skilled makers of weapons and armor. Weavers, tailors, healers, jewelers, booksellers, and other merchants also cater to the fortress's inhabitants and visitors.

### Adventure Hooks

The Solar Bastion offers many opportunities for driving adventures in your campaign, whether or not a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) appears. Use these ideas to inspire adventures that feature the knights of the Solar Bastion; the nonplayer characters named here also appear in the Solar Bastion Contact table below, and the stat block for [Sir Jared](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sir-jared-bmt.md) is presented at the end of the chapter:

- **Common Foes.** The Heralds of the Comet (see "chapter 12") identify both the characters and the Solar Bastion as threats and begin stirring up public sentiment against both groups. A knight of the Solar Bastion traveling through the area, Sir Howart, is thrown into jail and threatened with execution. Can the characters rescue him without harming villagers led astray by a malevolent cult?  
- **Haunted Riders.** [Sir Jared](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sir-jared-bmt.md), a knight of the Solar Bastion looking for signs of the Grim Harrow (see "chapter 19"), has come across a different threat: [skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) or [wights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight.md) riding [warhorse skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/warhorse-skeleton.md). Jared recruits the characters to help protect the local populace from these haunted riders and follow the riders back to their lair.  
- **Sleeping Village.** The characters come to a village where everyone is asleep—except Theira, a knight of the Solar Bastion, who has been trying to break the curse upon the place. Theira asks the adventurers for help, as a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) has been spotted at a traveling market many days away, and she's eager to track it down.  
- **Soul Prison.** The characters find a small sculpture that radiates magic. Further investigation reveals the sculpture contains the soul of a person who drew the Void card from a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). The effort to identify the soul leads the adventurers to Gundra, a retired knight of the Solar Bastion, who long ago gave up searching for the soul. The soul's identity is up to you. It might be someone close to Gundra, whose loss prompted Gundra's retirement. Or it might be the soul Hilarion tried to rescue before founding the Solar Bastion centuries ago.  
- **Suspicious Gains.** The characters acquire a number of identical [emeralds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/emerald.md) worth 1,000 gp each. After spending some of them, the characters are approached by Haddick, a researcher working for the Solar Bastion, who believes the gems came from a draw of the Gem card from a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). Haddick asks the characters to help trace the origin of the emeralds and, if the deck is responsible, determine if this sudden wealth was used for evil ends.

### Solar Bastion Patronage

"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything" presents rules for and examples of "group patrons": individuals or organizations that serve as patrons to an adventuring party. The Solar Bastion can function as a group patron, offering resources while sending adventurers on missions that further the organization's goals.

#### Solar Bastion Perks

With the Solar Bastion as your group's patron, you gain the following perks.

##### Magic of the Solar Bastion

Knights of the Solar Bastion cast any spell available to them on your behalf without charge. See the [Solar Bastion knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/solar-bastion-knight-bmt.md) stat block in this chapter for an example knight's spellcasting abilities. Some knights may have other spells they can cast, at the DM's discretion. The knight provides any costly material components needed for the spell, as long as you demonstrate your need and are in good standing with the Solar Bastion. In extreme circumstances, your group can appeal to Hilarion for more powerful magical assistance, including the [Resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resurrection.md) spell.

##### Equipment

You can purchase common magic items from your Solar Bastion contact. The DM determines the available stock or can call for a group Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to ascertain if the Solar Bastion's network can locate a desired item. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, `1d8` days must pass before you can search for the same item again in that community.

The DM sets the price for a common magic item or determines it randomly: `2d4 × 10` gp, or half as much for a consumable item such as a potion or scroll.

##### Research

The Library Tower in the Solar Bastion is a vast repository of knowledge that can help you unearth hidden secrets. If you communicate with your Solar Bastion contact or visit the Library Tower in person, you have advantage on ability checks to research lore related to the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) and other topics of interest to the Solar Bastion (including evil artifacts, curses, and other topics at the DM's discretion).

#### Solar Bastion Contact

When adventurers have the Solar Bastion as a patron, one member of that organization—typically a knight—serves as the party's primary contact, relaying messages to and from Hilarion and the other knights. Roll or pick from the Solar Bastion Contact table to determine the nature of your primary connection to the organization.

![Solar Bastion Contact](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/solar-bastion-contact-bmt.md)

> [!quote]- A quote from Asteria  
> 
> I like Hilarion. He gets straight to the point.

#### Solar Bastion Specialists

Because they usually work alone, knights of the Solar Bastion tend to be jacks-of-all-trades who know a little about a lot of things. As an adventuring party sponsored by the Solar Bastion, you instead provide specialized skills and have considerable freedom to pursue your specializations, as long as your efforts help to further the Solar Bastion's overall goals.

The Solar Bastion Member Roles table suggests roles you might fill in the Solar Bastion and the backgrounds frequently associated with each role.

#### Solar Bastion Quests

In service to the Solar Bastion, most of your time is spent in pursuit of the organization's goals. The Solar Bastion Quests table presents examples of missions your contact might send you on.

![Solar Bastion Quests](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/solar-bastion-quests-bmt.md)

#### Sir Jared

[Jared](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sir-jared-bmt.md) is a wandering knight who makes an excellent contact for groups that have Solar Bastion patronage. A former mercenary, Jared credits Hilarion with helping him change his ways and use his skills for good instead of gold, but he feels unworthy of the organization and has grown lonely after so long away from the Solar Bastion.

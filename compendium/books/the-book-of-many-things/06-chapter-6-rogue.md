# Chapter 6: Rogue
*Source: The Book of Many Things* 

The Rogue card embodies betrayal and hidden threats. This chapter includes magic card decks geared toward resourceful, subtle, and skill-focused characters, as well as character creation ideas inspired by the Rogue card. Then, this chapter presents tools and advice to adjudicate what happens when a character draws the Rogue card, including advice on how the villain enters the story, suggestions for their motivations, and a rogues' gallery of stat blocks that can represent this antagonist.

## Magic Card Decks

The following decks are presented in alphabetical order.

- [Card Sharp's Deck](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/card-sharps-deck-bmt.md)  
- [Deck of Dimensions](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-dimensions-bmt.md)  
- [Deck of Miscellany](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-miscellany-bmt.md)  
- [Deck of Wild Cards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-wild-cards-bmt.md)  

## Heroes of Destiny

The Rogue Destinies table provides narrative ideas inspired by the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) that players can use as prompts while developing characters. The entries in this table are geared toward characters who rely on cunning, skills, and versatility, but any character's story can benefit from the ideas presented here. When using this table to help shape your character's story, you can either choose entries that speak to you or randomly pull cards from [The Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) card set until you feel your character's story is complete.

The prompts in the table include personality traits, relationships, and events. Most describe your character's past, but some foretell something in your character's future instead. These events might be a mystery to your character, shared only between you and your DM, or perhaps your character learned about these events through omens or a reading from a fortune teller.

## Rogues' Gallery

When a character draws the Rogue card, a new villain's presence—if not their identity—is revealed to the characters. Who is this villain, and why are they an enemy? Here are a few options for how a Rogue villain can enter your campaign:

- **Impostor.** An acquaintance isn't who they appear to be. This nefarious individual might be using an assumed identity, or the villain could be a shapeshifting monster or possessed by a malevolent spirit. The person the characters thought they knew might never have existed, or that person might've been killed or abducted.  
- **New Arrival.** A person the adventurers have never met enters the story as an antagonist, with a motivation that sets them against the character who drew the card. This villain is new to the characters and might even have been created by the reality-altering power of the deck.  
- **Turncoat.** The villain is someone the characters know and have had positive dealings with. The villain's attitude toward the character who drew the card changes, either because of a revelation the villain receives about the character or because the deck reshuffles reality to spin the character's actions into something harmful.  

The Rogue card's magic might provide a glimpse of the future, but it can also manipulate reality in large or small ways. If the character who drew the card has a secret or has performed some action that would turn a friend into an enemy, the deck might ensure an ally gets that information, turning the ally against the character. Alternatively, the deck might change reality so that a bandit leader the character arrested suddenly has a cousin seeking revenge, or the spirit of a wicked cultist the character slew returns to torment the character by possessing a dear friend.

### The Rogue's Motivation

Why does this new villain oppose the character who drew the Rogue card? This question is just as important as who the villain is. The Villainous Motivations table offers sample goals for your new villain.

**Villainous Motivations**

`dice: [](06-chapter-6-rogue.md#^villainous-motivations)`

| dice: d6 | Motivation |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | Eliminate the character and take their place. |
| 2 | Use the character as the key to unlocking immense power, perhaps as a ritual sacrifice. |
| 3 | Claim a treasure from the character, or take the character's wealth and holdings for themself. |
| 4 | Avenge a harm caused by the character or someone the character represents. |
| 5 | Prove their superiority by bringing the character to ruin in a public and inescapable fashion. |
| 6 | Use the character to solve a great mystery and then claim credit. |

### Rogue Stat Blocks

This section offers four stat block options for the antagonist created when the Rogue card is drawn. Each is a legendary creature. These stat blocks can represent a new NPC that enters the story, an existing NPC who reveals their true identity, or someone transformed into an enemy by the deck's magic.

Each stat block represents an appropriate antagonist for campaign arcs in a particular tier of play. You can change the creature type and other features of these stat blocks to customize the antagonists for your campaign. For example, you could change the veiled presence's creature type to Humanoid and frame this villain's fantastical abilities as arising from powerful treasures the villain has amassed. Alternatively, you could make this villain a Fiend, change the damage dealt to necrotic, and give the villain a frightful aspect rather than a theme of divine judgment. Descriptions of these sample villains are below.

#### Ambitious Assassin

Appropriate for tier 1 play (levels 1 to 4), the [ambitious assassin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/ambitious-assassin-bmt.md) is a Humanoid who might be a charming manipulator or a ruthless killer.

#### Enchanting Infiltrator

An antagonist for tier 2 play (levels 5 to 10), the [enchanting infiltrator](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/enchanting-infiltrator-bmt.md) is a Fey that beguiles and misdirects.

#### Otherworldly Corrupter

A challenge for tier 3 play (levels 11 to 16), the [otherworldly corrupter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/otherworldly-corrupter-bmt.md) is a horrific Aberration that infects or impersonates a host.

#### Veiled Presence

The ultimate threat created by the Rogue card, the [veiled presence](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/veiled-presence-bmt.md) is a Celestial for tier 4 play (levels 17 to 20). This being descends from an Outer Plane to bring cosmic wrath upon the characters.

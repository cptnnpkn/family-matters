# Chapter 7: Sage
*Source: The Book of Many Things* 

The Sage card represents arcane knowledge, foresight, and skill. In that vein, this chapter explores the arcane possibilities held within a deck of cards. It begins with options for arcane characters, including a feat, spells, and background ideas suggested by the deck that add arcane flavor to your character's story.

The chapter concludes with two magic items. The [Deck of Many More Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-more-things-bmt.md) consists of cards created by spellcasters trying to add new cards to the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). The [Deck of Wonder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-wonder-bmt.md) is a less powerful—and less dangerous—version of the more famous deck, appropriate for lower-level characters.

## Character Options

This section contains a feat and spells for characters who combine cards and arcane magic, as well as narrative prompts to help you create your character and guide their story.

### Spells

This section contains spells DMs can make available to characters and creatures in their campaigns. The Spells table lists these spells, ordered by level; it also notes each spell's school of magic, whether it requires concentration, whether it bears the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it.

### Heroes of Destiny

The Sage Destinies table provides narrative ideas inspired by the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) that you can use while developing your character. The entries in this table are geared toward spellcasters, but they can enrich any character's story. When using this table, you can either choose the entries that speak to you or draw cards from the deck.

# Chapter 22: Euryale
*Source: The Book of Many Things* 

Though many cards in the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) depict individuals, only one card bears a proper name: [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md), a baneful card with a medusa-like visage. Many sages have pondered who this individual is and why she appears in the deck, speculating that perhaps [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) is a fearsome demigod or the wielder of a destructive curse. But the truth is simple: the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) was created through the actions of the person who held [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) most dear.

Long ago, the zealous ruler of a small coastal kingdom had a daughter he named [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md), or "shining star" in the language of the kingdom, for the stars shone auspiciously on her birth. But [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) defied his expectations. While other nobles' children happily played with their bevy of toys, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) intently focused on cataloging every constellation she could find. When other children greeted their parents with high heads and laughter, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) smiled firmly at the ground. Over time, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s father grew discontented with his daughter, frustrated by his many failed attempts to mold [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) into a person who matched the ideas in his head. The princess grew up isolated and independent, resenting the unending pressure others placed on her to be someone other than herself.

One afternoon, as [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) swam alone as a reprieve from her peers, a rip current swallowed her. Waves battered her against the rocks, then carried her unconscious body far from the kingdom's shore to a secret grotto in which the reclusive medusa [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) lived alone. Despite [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s anxiety (she was painfully aware that even kind folk feared her petrifying gaze), she tended to [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s wounds. When [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) awoke, the young woman didn't panic. Instead, the pair chatted throughout the night, talking of the stars, the sea, and everything else they had longed to share with someone for so long.

[Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) stayed until her wounds were healed. But rather than return to a father who was always disappointed in her, she decided to let her father assume she was dead. The secluded grotto became her new home. Over the years, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) taught [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) how to be a steward of the land, while [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) provided companionship, freely sharing with [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) all the esoteric interests she had pursued as a child. The two were sisters in all but blood, for [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) didn't pressure [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) to conform to her ways or to look her in the eye, and [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) didn't view [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) as a terrifying monster. Their existences blissfully intertwined for years, with neither forcing the other to be anything but themselves.

This peace was not to last, for [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s father never gave up hope his daughter still lived. After a decade of searching, he found her new home and ordered his soldiers to retrieve her through any means necessary. The idyllic grotto was overrun by violence, and although [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) defended her home and her sister with fervent abandon, turning many of the intruders to stone, both women were captured and taken to the coastal kingdom.

Determined to rein in his wayward daughter, the king locked [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) away in a keep and sentenced [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) to death. [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md), horrified, tried everything to save her dearest friend, but her pleas were dismissed. In desperation, she broke out of the keep, but she was overwhelmed by guards. Only then, after exhausting all options, did [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) give in to rage, screaming at the stars that were her namesake, searching for an answer.

An answer came, but it was not the one [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) hoped for. Istus, a god of fate, heard the princess and visited her in the keep that night. Every door opened for Istus, and invisible to every guard, she led [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) onto the cliffs, where—pointing out the constellations that governed [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s fates—Istus explained that nothing could be done. It was [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s destiny to be a dutiful daughter and princess, and it was [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s fate to be remembered forever as a tragic villain. [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) wasn't sure which part of this destiny she resented more.

"We don't get to choose our stories," the god explained.

"Don't we?" [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) replied. "I chose to see [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) differently, as she did me. That was enough to change our stories once, years ago. Let me change them again."

Swayed by [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s conviction, Istus reluctantly admitted that [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s fates could be rewritten, but the consequences of such an action were impossible to predict. Both women could get new destinies, but they might be no better than the last, and they could be worse. But [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) was adamant, so Istus reached into the sky and pulled down twenty-two constellations to form a deck of oracle cards: the first [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). Placing thirteen of these cards face up, one by one, Istus rewrote [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s story.

Armed with her new destiny, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) rescued [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md), and the two have since had many grand adventures together. In time, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) longed once more for a quiet life; the two women found a site in the Outlands that reminded them of the grotto that had once been their home, and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) retired there from adventuring. [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md), however, still felt a fervent desire to defend others from the injustice of destiny. Taking up the symbol of the medusa as an icon of protection, strength, and her dearest friend, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) has continued her journey alone. But Istus's act echoed through the multiverse, and the original [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) reflected across the planes, manifesting in varied forms throughout the cosmos.

![Euryale and Asteria have h...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/134-21-002-adventure.webp#center "Euryale and Asteria have had many adventures across the multiverse")

## The Princess and the Gardener

Adventurers are most likely to seek out [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) for information on the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). This section provides information about these two legendary figures, as well as adventure hooks and stat blocks for each hero.

### Asteria

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/135-21-003-asteria.webp#center)

Though she now travels alone, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) still draws much of her power from her bond with [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md). [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) is foremost a protector and warrior, traveling the multiverse to uproot injustice, defend innocents, and inspire hope. She believes everyone deserves a chance to write their own story on their own terms, and her deeds have inspired countless heroic tales.

Even after so many years, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) maintains a joyous wanderlust and passion for discovery. She's as likely to be found climbing trees or poring over arcane texts as she is brandishing her sword in battle. Anyone who engages [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) in conversation about her interests finds her an overflowing font of information. But she also retains her stubborn streak and quickly repudiates anyone who tries to order her around.

[Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) hasn't aged since Istus drew her future from the first [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). She doesn't know why this is but surmises her life is tied to that deck; so long as it continues to exist, so will she. She has no way to prove this hypothesis, but she nevertheless opposes groups like the Grim Harrow (see "chapter 19") that seek to destroy the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md).

#### Adventure Hooks

[Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) knows more about *Decks of Many Things* than anyone else alive. She has encountered many factions that concern themselves with the decks, defeating hierophants of the Heralds of the Comet (see "chapter 12"), dueling undead champions from the Grim Harrow, and infiltrating the Solar Bastion (see "chapter 10") before Hilarion discovered her. [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) is driven to protect innocent people who accidentally stumble across decks from their many dangers—especially from the curse imposed by the [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) card, which [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) resents as a defamation of her devoted friend. For this and many other reasons, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) tracks down the decks—and information on them—wherever they can be found.

Beyond her knowledge of *Decks of Many Things*, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) is an avid researcher into all things magical, making her an excellent knowledge source. She finds arcane magic particularly interesting. As an altruistic and heroic figure, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) also makes a fine patron for adventuring groups that align with her values. The following adventure hooks can introduce [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) into your campaign:

- **Arcane Information.** [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) knows a wealth of information regarding magic items and other arcane artifacts. Characters searching for rare or highly specialized knowledge could track down the legendary [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) for assistance.  
- **Hunting Decks.** [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) does her best to keep track of every iteration of the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) in the multiverse to ensure their power doesn't fall into corrupt hands; however, she's only one person, and things slip her notice. [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) might task the characters with locating a wayward deck and—if it's in the hands of someone who would abuse its fate-altering power—securing the deck and delivering it to her.  

### Euryale

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/136-21-004-euryale2.webp#center)

When she retired from adventuring, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) relocated to "Cair Ophidian", a small hideaway in the Outlands detailed later in this chapter. There, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) embraced the quiet life of a gardener, and she spends her time tending to the plants she's cultivated around her home. However, should [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) call for her aid, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) would venture across the multiverse without hesitation, battling tooth and nail to protect her sister.

[Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) has the petrifying gaze and venomous snaky hair of other medusas. But as an ancient and powerful druid, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) often adopts the form of a hulking serpent when threatened. She has attained precise control over her petrifying gaze, rendering her immune to its effects and allowing her to use it while not in her medusa guise. Despite her alarming appearance in serpent form, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) remains a healer and caretaker at heart.

#### Adventure Hooks

[Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) is a worthy ally or patron for an adventuring party and is a powerful druid with a wealth of knowledge and connections across the multiverse. Legends state that her garden in Cair Ophidian contains magical plants that can undo potent curses, including those inflicted by a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). The following adventure hooks can introduce [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) into your campaign:

- **Multiverse Messengers.** [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) maintains contact with friends and allies across the multiverse, and because she rarely travels now, she often needs the aid of others to deliver messages, packages, and other communications. [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) might enlist the characters to deliver something to one of her contacts, offering rare plants or gold in return.  
- **Powerful Flowers.** [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s garden contains many magical flowers, including some that allow an individual to cast the [Wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. Characters might seek out [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s flower garden if they need powerful magic dispelled, such as the effects of the more ruinous cards from a [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md).  
- **Zoology and Herbology.** As an archdruid, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) knows much regarding primal magic, nature gods, and rare magical flora and fauna. Characters might seek her out when their own knowledge in these areas is insufficient.  

## Cair Ophidian

Tucked away in a secluded region in the Outlands lies [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s home, Cair Ophidian. The site once held a palatial retreat built around a waterfall by a family of noble marids, but it was abandoned by its creators. During [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s adventures together, they stumbled upon the retreat's ruins and began using them as a safe house. Over the years, the pair rebuilt parts of the retreat, transforming it from a temporary hideaway into a home, which they named Cair Ophidian.

Now, [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) tends to her gardens and occasionally entertains lost travelers. When not exploring the multiverse, [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) can also be found at Cair Ophidian, visiting her dearest friend and recuperating before setting off on another adventure.

### Cair Ophidian Locations

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/138-map-21-01-cair-ophidian-player.webp#gallery)

#### Flower Garden

[Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s pride and joy, the flower garden boasts blooms from across the multiverse. A creature who plucks a flower from the garden rolls on the Cair Ophidian Flowers table to determine the type of flower chosen. A creature that spends 10 minutes studying the flowers can make a DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check; on a successful check, the creature can choose which flower it plucks from the table instead of rolling randomly. A serene [guardian naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/guardian-naga.md) named Jyada lives in the garden and serves as its protector. Should a creature try to sneak into the garden or pluck a flower without [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s permission, Jyada attacks.

![Cair Ophidian Flowers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/cair-ophidian-flowers-bmt.md)

![Wishing Lion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/139-21-005-flower.webp#center)

#### Food Gardens

Cair Ophidian's food gardens include a small vineyard, a bountiful vegetable garden plot, and a lush orchard. The gardens' produce is nonmagical and tastes excellent, and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) uses it for cooking. Four [couatls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/couatl.md) watch over the food gardens; they often adopt the shape of friendly [mastiffs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mastiff.md).

#### Guesthouse

A single-story guesthouse sits on the cliff above the hot spring and gardens. This building is empty unless [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) are hosting friends or wayward travelers there. The guesthouse has a single large bed, but room for up to five people in a pinch.

#### Rainbow Hot Spring

Stairs lead from what was once a plaza, now crumbling and overgrown, directly into this hot spring's steaming, prismatic waters. A creature that spends at least 1 hour bathing in the hot spring immediately gains the benefits of finishing a long rest. A creature can benefit from the hot spring's magic once every 24 hours.

#### Villa

Overlooking the shimmering waterfall, Cair Ophidian's villa is [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s home. The first story is an open space for lounging, dining, and meeting with guests. The second story contains both women's private living quarters as well as a small observatory and library. [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) keeps a fantastic collection of magical cards in this library, including multiple versions of the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) gathered from around the multiverse. Some of these decks are incomplete or contain unusual cards; a few take alternative forms, such as a die with twenty-two sides or a collection of twenty-two runestones.

### Adventure Hooks

Below are several adventure hooks you can use to draw characters to Cair Ophidian:

- **Deck Heist.** The characters are approached by mysterious individuals who want to hire them to steal [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md)'s collection of magical cards. These patrons are agents of the Grim Harrow, who expect the adventurers to attract the ire of [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) and [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md), giving the Grim Harrow a chance to destroy the collection in the chaos. To complicate matters, [rifflers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/riffler-bmt.md) (see "chapter 21") have learned of the heist and are trying to beat the characters to the score.  
- **Extraplanar Eviction.** The [marids](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/marid.md) who constructed the original palace on the site of Cair Ophidian decide the new complex is an outrageous insult. With a retinue of extraplanar servants, they drive [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) out. This conflict could be resolved diplomatically, but the marids are deceptive and proud, concealing the reason they left their estate and refusing to negotiate with [Asteria](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md) or [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md), who turn to the characters for help.  
- **Guest in Need.** [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) discovers a wounded traveler in the Outlands and brings them to Cair Ophidian to recover. This guest remembers nothing from before [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) found them, not even their name. [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) asks the characters to track down her guest's identity while she monitors the guest's recovery. Tie the identity of this guest—and the inevitable complications that arise—to the direction you want to take the campaign. For example, perhaps the traveler is an astral elf, and the characters must secure a spelljamming vessel to learn more. Or the wayward guest might be a refugee from Ravenloft—perhaps even a Darklord in disguise!

Even without a deck's interference, life is a chaotic and nonsensical jumble of joyous highs and miserable lows, right choices and wrong decisions, and everything in between. Each deck just gives us a way to tap into that chaos and make it our own. It's just one of many ways to take your story into your own hands.

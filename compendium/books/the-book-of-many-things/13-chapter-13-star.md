# Chapter 13: Star
*Source: The Book of Many Things* 

When Istus created the first [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md), she drew constellations from the sky to create each card. This chapter presents these constellations, known as the Sky of Many Things, complete with magical effects created by the constellations as well as a zodiac that might influence the destiny of those born under its signs.

The latter part of the chapter, intended for the DM, includes details and rules for observatories: locations that facilitate stargazing and astronomical studies.

## The Sky of Many Things

A zodiac is a series of constellations that appear to rotate around the night sky in time with the changing seasons. Many people use the alignment of zodiac constellations to explain personality traits, mysterious phenomena, or other patterns. This section presents a zodiac called the Sky of Many Things. It was from this zodiac that Istus, god of fate, drew the original [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md).

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/072-12-001-star.webp#center)

If you're a player, the Sky of Many Things might inspire your character's backstory, starting from the moment that character was born. If you're a DM, this zodiac can inspire countless adventures themed around prophecy and fate, or it could be a starting point for a zodiac of your own creation.

A group of associated celestial and planetary objects is called a Wildspace system. Wildspace systems exist on the Astral Plane—an infinite void that surrounds all worlds of the Material Plane.

> Different Wildspace systems drift about the Astral Plane. Greyspace is the system of the Greyhawk campaign setting, for example, and Realmspace encompasses Toril and the neighboring planets of the Forgotten Realms. Clownspace, Krynnspace, Xaryxispace, and countless other Wildspace systems populate the Astral Plane.

Stargazers who spin tales about the sparkling lights in the night sky might be surprised at how accurate their stellar myths really are.

### Zodiac Signs

A zodiac sign is a mythological entity associated with a constellation in a zodiac. For the Sky of Many Things, a creature is said to be "born under" a zodiac sign if its birthday occurs during the period when that sign's constellation is most prominent in the night sky. In other zodiac traditions, a creature's "sun sign"—the constellation that overlapped with the sun at the time of the creature's birth—might carry more weight.

Each zodiac sign is associated with an omen: a vague prophecy of the events of an individual's life. These predictions might not come true, or they might manifest in unanticipated ways.

In the sections that follow, each zodiac sign's entry includes its common nickname, the period in which its constellation appears most prominently in the night sky, a description of the sign's constellation, common myths and beliefs about it, and omens associated with creatures born under that sign. The signs are presented in their order within the zodiac.

#### Skull

*The Watcher; Most Prominent in Midwinter*

Dim stars form the eyes and teeth of the Skull, also known as the Watcher. This constellation looms near the horizon throughout the year, then fills the center of the sky during the depths of winter. Its inscrutable expression suggests a skeletal face gazing upon—or grinning at—the other constellations of the zodiac.

##### Omen of Death

Those born under the Skull are regarded as harbingers of mortal doom or fatal misfortune. Many experience tragedy at a young age. Professions associated with this sign include coroner, executioner, exorcist, grave robber, and mortician.

#### Balance

*The Merchant; Most Prominent in Late Winter*

A scale made of stars represents the Balance. The constellation's brightest star forms the fulcrum on which the plates of the scale rest. Many illustrations of the Balance show a venerable trader standing behind the scales.

##### Omen of Fair Treatment

Those born under the Balance are fated for a life of equal measure weal and woe; every misfortune they endure is eventually balanced by good tidings. Many Balances live up to their birth sign's moniker by becoming traders or merchants.

#### Sage

*The Wise One; Most Prominent in Early Spring*

In early myths, this staff-carrying constellation aimlessly wandered all over the sky. His restlessness abated only after he settled a dispute between the Balance and the Throne.

##### Omen of Imagination

Those born under the Sage are destined to solve a particularly obstinate problem or unravel a confounding mystery. This leads many Sages to an adventuring life, but they also find plenty of puzzles to solve as engineers or physicians, or in law enforcement careers.

#### Throne

*The Everlasting; Most Prominent in Midspring*

The Throne's prominence marks the beginning of the Righteous Quartet, four months commonly associated with honor, goodwill, and righteous feelings. The Everlasting's stars lead the way, heralding the life and energy usually associated with warmer months.

##### Omen of Promise

Powerful rulers hope to see an heir born under the Throne, as individuals born to this sign often end up adopting leadership roles. But leadership takes many forms—a child born under the Throne might head a large family, run a professional guild, or rise to prominence in a temple.

#### Key

*The Child; Prominent in Late Spring*

Many artists' interpretations of this constellation show a child holding a silver Key in one hand. The child's smile suggests benign curiosity. As this illustration suggests, the Key is often associated with great power in humble (or even hapless) hands.

##### Omen of Insight

Those born to the Key are destined to travel to unexplored places, break taboos, and question assumptions long held dear. They are guides and scouts, researchers and archaeologists, revolutionaries and thieves.

#### Flames

*The Lovers; Most Prominent in Early Summer*

Tempers and passions flare under the Flames, also known as the Lovers. The stars that form the constellation suggest embracing figures or, in more chaste circles, a pair of hands pressed palms together. In mythological stories, the Lovers are bored by the Talons and would rather make tragic deals with the Gem. When portrayed as a person, the Flames takes up with the Rogue, contributing to the belief that opposites attract.

##### Omen of Passion

Children born under the Flames are destined to arouse strong emotions in other people—be it love or anger. They are artists, counselors, and religious figures.

#### Knight

*The Dragon Slayer; Most Prominent in Midsummer*

The Knight soars overhead during high summer—the final month of the Righteous Quartet. The prominence of these stars coincides with sunny weather and summer storms—times of tranquility and war, devastation and prosperity.

##### Omen of Valor

Children born under the Knight are destined to embark on and succeed in a great quest. In adulthood, they take up the adventuring lifestyle and befriend other thrill-seeking heroes. There's no more loyal friend than one born under the sign of the Knight.

#### Euryale

*The Gardener; Prominent in Late Summer*

When the legendary druid [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) appears on the horizon, farmers sow their final late-season seeds and prepare their other fields for harvest. [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s constellation was created at the same time as the first [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md). Artistic renditions of this constellation often show [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md)'s hair as a tangle of snakes and wildflowers.

##### Omen of Dedication

Those born under the sign of [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md) are fated for intense personal relationships that prove their value when hardship comes. They find careers as caregivers or in other occupations that allow them to work closely with another person, as a squire assists a knight.

#### Rogue

*Night's Edge; Most Prominent in Early Autumn*

Like a skilled bandit, the Rogue slinks onto the night sky without drawing attention to herself. By the time leaves are turning color and evenings are getting colder, Night's Edge already looms high overhead, dagger in hand. Legend has it that in her haste to steal from [Euryale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md), the Rogue failed to notice the valuable Gem right behind her.

##### Omen of Betrayal

Those born under the Rogue are destined to be betrayed by someone close to them, or to betray first in an act of self-preservation. They pursue trades that reward shifting loyalties, such as con artists, courtiers, or politicians.

#### Gem

*The Genie; Most Prominent in Midautumn*

Different cultures might view this constellation as a diamond, ruby, or sapphire. The Genie appears in countless zodiac legends, typically as the mysterious instigator of the Knight's adventure, the source of the Sage's wanderings, or the silent shadowy companion of the Jester.

##### Omen of Abundance

The Gem is a sign of good fortune, and those born under this constellation are blessed with a prosperous future. While most born under the Gem hope for material wealth, abundance can take many forms, including a large family or a grand collection of inherited objects.

#### Talons

*The Elder; Most Prominent in Late Autumn*

Many societies see the herald of winter as a dour constellation. In some folklore, the Talons is a stern grandparent of the Knight or the Flames. When one of these younger signs commits a grievous error despite ample warning, the Elder chides the youth while taking the blame. In other tales, the Elder is a usurper of the Throne and seeks to gain power by manipulating the Rogue or scheming with the Skull.

##### Omen of Loss

Children born under this sign are sometimes distinguished by a wrinkled brow, supposedly a mark left by the Talons themselves. These children are destined to lose everything—or to cause an equally devastating loss for another. They can be found in occupations that involve taking and hoarding, such as loan shark, smuggler, and burglar.

#### Jester

*The Nilbog; Most Prominent in Early Winter*

The Jester dances atop the other zodiac members, portending the start of winter. Good cheer and wry sorrow occur in equal measure when the Nilbog is involved, and many winter holidays are celebrated under his mischievous grin.

##### Omen of Chaos

While those born under other signs find a hint of their future in the stars, the futures of those born to the Jester are unknowable. These people tend to be agents of chaos, and they can be found in any occupation.

### Zodiac Associations

![The Sky of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/073-12-002-sky.webp#center)

The Common Zodiac Associations table summarizes astrological beliefs about the Sky of Many Things. The first three columns list the names of the zodiac's constellations, their nicknames, and the time of year they appear most prominently in the night sky. The next three columns denote the birthstone, creature, and color associated with each of the twelve signs.

The Ability Score column suggests individuals born under a specific sign are believed to have characteristics related to this attribute. People born under the Balance, for example, might be referred to as shrewd or cunning, a sign of their high Intelligence score.

![Common Zodiac Associations](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/common-zodiac-associations-bmt.md)

### Zodiac Phenomena

The constellations of the Sky of Many Things can impose powerful magical effects. These zodiac phenomena can be benign or harmful, temporary or permanent, isolated or far reaching. A zodiac phenomenon might sweep over an entire planet once in a generation, or it might occur monthly in a remote village. The DM decides when and where zodiac phenomena occur as well as their impact on the affected region.

The Zodiac Phenomena table lists effects and brief encounters associated with the constellations of the Sky of Many Things. You can use the effect associated with the zodiac constellation most prominent in the game's current time of year, or you can choose randomly by rolling on the table. The following are examples of events that might correspond with a zodiac phenomenon:

- A season changes, with a new constellation rising to prominence.  
- One or more planets align inside a given constellation.  
- Darkness falls on a moonless night.  
- The characters take a long rest.  
- A character peers through an observatory's telescope.  
- The clouds break, revealing the stars above.  
- A creature casts a divination spell.

## Observatories

Observatories are structures that help astronomers and stargazers observe the cosmos. This section includes rules and adventure ideas the DM can use for an observatory in any campaign.

The simplest observatories are flat platforms on tall hills, sometimes with upright stone slabs with holes carved into them to aid in stargazing. A well-appointed observatory could boast resources such as complex telescopes, libraries, mechanical clocks, and magical divinatory aids.

An observatory can serve a variety of roles in adventures. Its air of occult mystery makes it an enticing place to explore, and the kinds of people and monsters attracted to an observatory—sages, eccentrics, and space travelers—make it a great location for roleplaying and combat encounters.

### Observatory Locations

For optimal stargazing, an observatory is typically situated at a high elevation, such as a mountain peak or a coastal bluff. Astronomers prize a clear, dark sky, so many observatories are built in the wilderness. Such locations are often isolated, and the staff that work in these remote locales are famous for eccentricities born out of extended loneliness and isolation. That said, a particularly well-equipped observatory can employ magic to cut through the firelight and smoke created by a nearby settlement, enable quick travel for astronomers and supply wagons, and communicate with far-off individuals.

#### Regional Effects

Observatories are places of wonder that bridge the known world and the cosmos, so observatories and their environs are often affected by supernatural forces. You can apply one or more regional effects to an observatory to make the place feel otherworldly, or you can invent a new regional effect of your own. These regional effects don't affect the challenge rating of monsters encountered around the observatory:

- **Alien Hot Spot.** The observatory is an alluring destination for alien stargazers. Extraterrestrial Aberrations are much more likely to appear within 6 miles of the observatory.  
- **Clear Nights.** The weather around the observatory is always cool and calm. During the day, fog covers the area within 6 miles of the observatory, making the area "heavily obscured". At dusk, the fog clears, unveiling a cloudless night sky.  
- **Communal Dreaming.** Creatures that fall asleep within 6 miles of the observatory share the same dreamscape. While dreaming, creatures can see and interact with other sleeping creatures' dream forms, but they can't harm or otherwise affect one another's physical bodies.  
- **Constellation Lines.** At night, stars visible from the observatory are connected by faint, silver lines that demarcate the constellations.  
- **Timeless Materials.** The observatory was built to withstand the test of time and buttressed with fortifying magic. The observatory and structures within 6 miles of the observatory never erode or degrade from natural causes.  

### Example Observatory

Map 13.1 shows an example of a midsize observatory. This observatory is staffed by `2d4` scholars who study the stars and provide visitors with information and counsel. Use the [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) stat block to represent these scholars, if necessary.

Despite their meager resources, the astronomers who work at this remote observatory don't charge adventurers for most services. Instead, the scholars might request a favor, such as clearing out a local monster den or collecting a rare magical ingredient from a nearby mountaintop. In return, the scholars allow the characters to use the observatory as a temporary base and grant the characters access to the observatory's amenities, as described below.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/075-map-12-01-observatory-player.webp#gallery)

#### Astronomical Clock

The front door of the observatory leads into the building's ground floor. Suspended from the ceiling is a clockface ten feet across, surrounded by slowly turning gears. Slender metal chains descend from the gears through small holes in the floor to a subterranean waterwheel. Since this observatory is on a hilltop with no access to running water, attendants use a [Decanter of Endless Water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/decanter-of-endless-water.md) to fill an elevated basin that feeds the waterwheel. As the wheel rotates, the chains connected to it move the clock gears, which in turn control the hands and dials on the clock's face.

This clock can tell not just the time of day but also the times for sunrise and sundown, the phase of the moon, and the position of the zodiac. The observatory charges visitors a fee to see the clock and have a scholar interpret it for them. This is the observatory's primary source of income; since demand is low, funding is a perpetual struggle.

Adjoining chambers accommodate the observatory staff. Stairs ascend from the clock room to the library.

> [!note] Distant Wonders
> 
> Magical telescopes can see things an ordinary spyglass can't, from far-off worlds to incoming comets. Some astronomers, such as scholars of the Solar Bastion or the apocalyptic Heralds of the Comet, can use such telescopes to locate obscure wonders, like the Donjon Sphere. The Solar Bastion, Heralds of the Comet, and Donjon Sphere are detailed in "chapters 10", "12", and "17", respectively.

#### Library

The library on the second floor of this observatory holds books of extraterrestrial esoterica, plus astronomical references like star charts, almanacs, and maps of Wildspace systems. Unusual items of celestial import, such as fallen meteorites and flora collected from alien worlds, are also kept here for study.

#### Planetarium

![Telescopic Transporter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/books/the-book-of-many-things/img/076-12-003-telescope.webp#center)

The domed ceiling of this windowless chamber is permanently enchanted to show the stars and planets overhead, night or day. Four comfortable couches allow visitors (or astronomers seeking a nap) to watch the stars in peace. Using a crystal orb in an adjacent room, resident astronomers can change the illusion to simulate the view of the night sky from any point on the planet at any time of year.

#### Teleportation Circle

Spellcasters who cast the [Teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md) or [Teleportation Circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spell can use the sigil sequence inscribed on this permanent teleportation circle.

#### Telescope

The massive mechanism here is a priceless [Telescopic Transporter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/telescopic-transporter-bmt.md) (described later in this chapter). The astronomers who work at the observatory are extremely proud of their telescope and regale any visitor with the long tale of how it was designed, financed, and finally constructed—at great cost. This story always ends with a suggestion that visitors should help address the observatory's perpetual financial woes with a modest donation.

### Telescope Travel

Certain magical telescopes allow their users to not only view the stars, but also travel among them. Of course, as with most types of powerful technology, the use of such a device comes with significant risks. The following magic item is one example of a telescope that enables interstellar travel.

#### Telescopic Transporter

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This enormous telescope allows you to view distant celestial objects, including stars, Wildspace systems, and Astral Sea phenomena like the cities of deities or the petrified husks of dead gods.

After spending 1 hour calibrating the telescope, you can attempt to travel to the planet or celestial body at which the telescope is currently pointed. At the end of the hour, make a DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, you and eight other willing creatures touching the telescope, along with everything all travelers are wearing and carrying, safely teleport to unoccupied spaces at the intended destination. On a failed check, a mishap occurs instead. The DM rolls on the Telescope Travel Mishaps table to determine the mishap or chooses a mishap that's good for the campaign.

![Telescope Travel Mishaps](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/telescope-travel-mishaps-bmt.md)

> [!note] Rescue Mission
> 
> A character who draws the Donjon card from the [Deck of Many Things](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md) is whisked away to an extradimensional prison such as the Donjon Sphere, detailed in "chapter 17". This remote dungeon drifts in the vast Astral Sea, so reaching it is no mean feat. However, a [Telescopic Transporter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/telescopic-transporter-bmt.md) is a ready—if slightly unreliable—means of reuniting the party. The Donjon Sphere holds one of these telescopes, so a character trapped there might use it to find a way home. At your discretion, the rest of the party could instead find a different *Telescopic Transporter* and use it to travel to the Donjon Sphere for a daring rescue mission.

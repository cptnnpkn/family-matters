# Using This Book
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse, p. 4* 

The multiverse of Dungeons and Dragons brims with peril, and many of the greatest dangers are monsters. A companion to the "Monster Manual", this book collects monsters from many different planes of existence, each creature ready to imperil D&D heroes of different levels. The book also includes game statistics for nonplayer characters, who may assist or oppose the heroes, and an array of fantastical races for players to consider for their characters. The monsters and fantastical races in the following chapters are accompanied by the occasional comments of the mighty wizard Mordenkainen, one of the most learned mages of the D&D world of Greyhawk. The archmage Tasha, Mordenkainen's friendly rival, interjects as well. All together, the monsters, nonplayer characters, and fantastical races herein provide a host of new friends and foes to populate your D&D worlds.

## What You'll Find Within

- **Chapter 1, "Fantastical Races,".** presents over 30 race options for player characters, complementing the options in the "Player's Handbook" and other D&D books. These races debuted elsewhere and appear all together for the first time here, each of them revised to fit into the current state of the game.  
- **Chapter 2, "Bestiary,".** contains over 250 monsters and NPCs, each one represented by a stat block and story text. When you're preparing to run an adventure as the DM, consider sprinkling these creatures into your games, mixing them with the monsters and NPCs from the "Monster Manual". The creatures in this chapter fit seamlessly with the ones you use from other D&D books.  
- **Appendix, "Monster Lists,".** makes it easy for you to find the right stat blocks for your adventures. This appendix lists the book's monsters and NPCs by creature type, challenge rating, and environment.

# Putting It All Together
*Source: Domains of Delight, p. 22* 

[Yarnspinner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yarnspinner-dod.md) is an archfey created using the tables in part 2. His domain, Fablerise, was fleshed out using the tables in part 3. Fablerise is a small Domain of Delightâ€”roughly three square miles nestled in a forest called Thither, which is part of a much larger Domain of Delight called Prismeer. [Yarnspinner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yarnspinner-dod.md) only recently arrived in Thither and is unaware that he is intruding upon another archfey's territory (see The Wild Beyond the Witchlight for more information about Prismeer and its archfey ruler).

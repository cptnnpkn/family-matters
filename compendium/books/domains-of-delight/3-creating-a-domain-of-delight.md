# Creating a Domain of Delight
*Source: Domains of Delight, p. 16* 

Once your archfey is fleshed out, you can create the Domain of Delight that serves as the archfey's home in the Feywild. Generally, the size of a Domain of Delight is a good determiner of an archfey's power, but an archfey's domain can be as big or as small as you want it to be.

## Geographical Features

A small Domain of Delight might have only one prominent geographical feature, which you can determine randomly by rolling on the Geographical Features table. A large Domain of Delight can have multiple geographical features, which you can determine by rolling more than once on the table.

## Domain Theme

A Domain of Delight might have a prevailing theme, which you can determine randomly by rolling on the Domain Theme table.

## Coming and Going

Travelers who don't have access to [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spells or similar magic must rely on other means to travel to and from a Domain of Delight. Fey crossings are the most common means of transit between the Material Plane and the Feywild; more information about them can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

An archfey is usually aware of any Fey crossings that allow creatures to enter and leave the archfey's domain and may protect these Fey crossings or leave them unguarded. Some Fey crossings operate only at certain times or when certain conditions are met. The Fey Crossings table allows you to randomly determine the characteristics of a fey crossing that allows passage to and from a Domain of Delight. Your Domain of Delight can have as few or as many Fey crossings as you like, and they need not all be the same in appearance or function.

Geographical features on one side of a fey crossing tend to be similar to those on the other side, to the extent that some travelers might be unaware they've left one plane of existence and entered another. For example, if one stumbles upon a fey crossing in a cave, a similar cave might lie on the other side of that fey crossing, as if the caves were near-perfect reflections of each other.

## Travel in the Domain

Visitors to a Domain of Delight are often confounded by the Feywild's power to distort distance, time, and reality. A traveler might see a hilltop that appears to be a mile away and march toward it, only to find the hilltop getting farther away. Similarly, a wanderer who asks for directions might be told to follow a particular trail, only to discover the trail changes course depending on the mood of those who travel along it. Determining how far one has traveled in a particular amount of time can be a headscratcher.

### Magical Shortcuts

Domain denizens and guides know some of the tricks to navigating a Domain of Delight, including magical shortcuts. A shortcut can also be found by accident or learned in some other way. For example, a traveler might wake from a vivid dream or a trance with knowledge of a shortcut that fades from memory after an hour.

To take advantage of a magical shortcut, one must spend 1 minute performing a routine; the Shortcut Routines table provides examples. At the end of this routine, the performer and any creatures traveling with them find themselves closer to their intended destination. How much closer is up to the DM, but a shortcut routine usually reduces the travel time to the intended destination by at least half.

A shortcut routine allows for safe, expeditious travel from one location in the Feywild to a specific destination in the Feywild, and that's all. For example, it might expedite travel from the edge of an archfey's domain to the entrance of the archfey's lair but not the other way around, and it wouldn't shorten the travel time to other locations in the domain.

## Drama

You can bring your Domain of Delight to life by adding drama. When the characters show up, they might become swept up in this drama, perhaps even embroiled in intrigue. The drama can be anything from a petty squabble between Fey settlements to a full-blown fomorian incursion. To determine a worthy conflict, you can roll on the Domain Drama table or choose an entry that you like.

## Weird Magic

Magical forces, strange interlopers, and tragic events can alter a smaller region within a Domain of Delight. While the flora, fauna, structures, and inhabitants might remain unaffected, the region's innate character takes on new qualities.

When you wish to include such a region, roll on the Weird Magic Effects table to determine its effects, or choose an entry you like. These effects occur whenever you please, at the time each description suggests, or under one or more of the following circumstances:

- Soon after the party first enters the region  
- When a creature loses more than half its hit points  
- When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher  
- When a creature activates a magic item  
- When a creature makes an exceptionally loud noise or otherwise attracts attention  
- When the party spends at least 30 minutes in the same region

## Domain Denizens

The Feywild Creatures table can help you populate a Domain of Delight. Stat blocks for the listed creatures appear in the "Monster Manual" or The Wild Beyond the Witchlight.

Just because a creature doesn't appear on the Feywild Creatures table doesn't mean that it can't appear in a Domain of Delight. Any D&D creature can find its way to the Feywild, and sometimes it's fun to surprise players with creatures their characters would not expect to meet in the Feywild, such as a band of githyanki or a vampire.

### Domain Visitors

As they explore a domain, the characters might encounter other visitors, including friends and foes of the domain's archfey, planar travelers, and lost souls trying to find a way home. Use the Domain Visitors table to generate encounters with such folk.

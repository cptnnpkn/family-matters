# Creating an Archfey
*Source: Domains of Delight, p. 12* 

Archfey are among the most powerful beings in the Feywild. Consciously or unconsciously, they transform their Feywild homes into reflections of their desires and complex personalities. Powerful archfey such as the Summer Queen and the Queen of Air and Darkness rule vast domains, and their influence is so great that their courts stretch beyond the borders of their Domains of Delight to the far ends of the Feywild. Other, lesser known archfey rule domains that are minuscule by comparison, but no less wondrous.

## Where to Start?

Most archfey are ancient creatures, and no two are alike. When creating an archfey, here are some good questions to ask yourself:

- Under what circumstances might adventurers encounter the archfey?  
- Does the archfey have any allegiance to the Summer Court or the Gloaming Court?  
- What traits does the archfey have? Specifically, what do they look like, what is their personality, and what magical powers do they possess?  

These questions are tackled in the sections that follow. The answers will help you flesh out the archfey's Domain of Delight.

### Encountering the Archfey

Think about how and when you expect the adventurers to encounter your archfey. The archfey might infiltrate the party using illusion magic or spy on the characters from afar to discern their intentions before confronting them. The archfey might test the characters' mettle with a series of challenging encounters or puzzles before deeming them fit to bask in the archfey's presence. Conversely, the archfey might be blissfully unaware of the party's intrusion or show no interest in the characters. A shy or reclusive archfey might not want to be disturbed at all.

How and when the archfey crosses paths with the adventurers can be determined by answering the following questions:

- Does the archfey engage with visitors or shun them?  
- Does the archfey wander their domain, or do they prefer to remain in their lair?  
- Does the archfey visit other domains? Are they involved in the politics of the Fey courts?  

### Fey Court Allegiances

The Summer Queen and the Queen of Air of Darkness are so powerful that other archfey might feel it's in their best interest to ally with one or both of them. By swearing allegiance to either queen, an archfey gains the privilege of audiences with the queen and faint assurances that the queen's court will not meddle in the affairs of the archfey or their domain.

Archfey that do not pledge allegiance to one court or the other can find their domains overrun with Seelie or Unseelie spies or overlapped by the domains of archfey in league with one or both queens.

### Presentation

Archfey have one thing in common: they're all Fey. Beyond that, their features vary widely. To randomly determine what your archfey looks like, roll on the Archfey's Presentation table.

### Personality

If you haven't already settled on a personality for your archfey, you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Archfey's Personality table.

### Obsessions

Obsessions are common among archfey. An archfey might be obsessed with a painting of themself and spend days, months, or years staring at it. An archfey might obsess over a perceived injustice and work tirelessly to correct it. An archfey might obsess over their collection of acorns, believing the acorns are keys that unlock the secrets of the multiverse.

If you want your archfey to have an obsession, you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Archfey Obsession table.

### Signature Magic

Almost every archfey has a signature magical power, and this power might be tied to their appearance or personality; for example, a metallic archfey might have the power to corrode or heat metal, while a madcap archfey might have the power to cause wild magic effects similar to those described the [Wild Magic Surge](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in the "Sorcerer" section of the Player's Handbook. The Signature Magic table presents some other possibilities.

### Magical Gifts

Some archfey have the power to give magical gifts to those they deem worthy. A gift could be anything from a trinket that grants safe passage through the archfey's domain to a magic item that can be used to defeat a powerful monster. As the DM, you decide whether such a gift is warranted. To randomly determine what kind of gift your archfey might bestow on a character, roll on the Magical Gifts table.

## Archfey Statistics

If your campaign includes an archfey whom the characters might end up fighting, create a stat block for the archfey or modify some other creature's stat block to suit your needs. The Dungeon Master's Guide contains guidance for modifying existing stat blocks.

Alternatively, choose a stat block of CR 5 or higher that has one of the following creature types: Beast, Elemental, Fey, Giant, Humanoid, or Plant. Change the creature's type to Fey, make its Intelligence at least 10 (+0), and give it two languages if doesn't speak any languages. Also give the creature one or both of the following traits:

### Fey Rebirth

If the archfey dies in its Domain of Delight, it revives with all its hit points `1d4` days later in a safe location in that domain.

### Legendary Resistance (3/Day)

If the archfey fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

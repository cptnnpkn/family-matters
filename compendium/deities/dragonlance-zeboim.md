Zeboim is the god of the ocean in its destructive aspect, including storms and dangerous sea creatures. She is a mercurial god, and even her followers aren't safe from her frequent bouts of rage. Most sailors pray to Habbakuk to keep Zeboim at bay, but some make offerings to Zeboim to allay her wrath.

Sargonnas is the unpredictable god of flame, vengeance, and wrath. Though he's a consort to Takhisis, he schemes against her as often as he fights on her behalf. He is worshiped by those who seek retribution. His true form is that of a monstrous minotaur, and many minotaurs revere him under the name Sargas.

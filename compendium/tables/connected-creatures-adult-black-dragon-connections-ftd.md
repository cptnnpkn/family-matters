| dice: d8 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) has learned to domesticate swamp-bred [chimeras](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md) as guardians and has sold a few of the creatures to local warlords. |
| 2 | A cult of assassins worships an [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) as an avatar of their deity. The dragon now uses the cult to destabilize the local sovereign's rule. |
| 3 | Ruins rumored to hold the treasury of a lost empire are guarded by an elaborate network of ooze-based traps designed by a restless [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md). |
| 4 | The appearance of a [spirit naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/spirit-naga.md) in the domain of an [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) encourages the dragon to study necromancy. |
| 5 | An [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) has hidden a cache of gems in a dismal topiary maze filled with [shambling mounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md), traps, and noxious plant life, all for the amusement of testing adventurers. |
| 6 | An [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) has bound [water elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) to the task of bringing food to the dragon's lair. |
| 7 | A bullywug community seeks help to defeat an [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) who has been feasting on the bullywugs' domesticated [giant frogs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-frog.md). |
| 8 | Two nations—one led by an [adult black dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) and the other by a [yuan-ti abomination](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination.md)—are on the brink of joining forces to destroy a third nation. The threatened nation is recruiting adventurers to defend it. |

**Wilderness Encounters**

`dice: [](wilderness-encounters-llk.md#^wilderness-encounters)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | A pack of [Sprites](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite.md) pester the party, playing tricks and attempting to steal small items until the characters leave their territory. If they are treated with deference, the sprites might help the characters find the correct path and hurry them along. If assaulted in any way, fifteen [Sprites](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite.md) riding [Stirges](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) attack. (The sprites' invisibility extends to the stirges as well while they are mounted.) |
| 2 | The path leads into a lonely grove that serves as the grave of a former dryad queen. If appropriate respects are paid, the characters have a 50% chance chance to receive a supernatural gift (see "chapter 7" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide")—a charm that allows a character to cast the [Galder's tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/galders-tower-llk.md) spell (see appendix E) once as an action. |
| 3 | A [Treant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md) and a [Stone Golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) were magically locked together during an ancient battle. Over the centuries since, fey gardeners have turned the two into a temple. Characters who explore the temple might inadvertently help the treant or the golem finally overcome its foe. |
| 4 | A leprechaun (use [Quickling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/quickling-mpmm.md) statistics from "Volo's Guide to Monsters") crosses the characters' path. If successfully caught without being killed, the creature negotiates its release with the location of its hidden treasure: 1,000 gp in brightly polished coins. |
| 5 | Gathering firewood results in a visit from an angered undead [Treant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md). (Use normal statistics, but the creature has the undead type and cannot use its Animate Trees feature). The treant collects all such fallen branches to take to a hidden graveyard of treant remains, and it angrily attacks any characters who get in its way. |
| 6–7 | Some strange creature has wandered down from the Monastery of the Distressed Body. Such creatures might include an ancient security construct gone mad (use [Oaken Bolter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/clockwork-oaken-bolter-mpmm.md) statistics from "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes") or a [Gibbering Mouther](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) with a mechanical skull housing its central brain. |
| 8–10 | The characters come across a group of roving outlaws (five to ten [Thugs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) led by a [Bandit Captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)), who are heading to the monastery to join its ranks. They possess rumors and fragments of a map, and are keen to steal the characters' resources—especially if [Gearbox](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gearbox-llk.md) the modron is present. |

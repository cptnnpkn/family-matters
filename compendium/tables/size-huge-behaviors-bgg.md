| dice: d8 | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | The giant has a pet (a [panther](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther.md), a [wolf](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/wolf.md), or a [giant weasel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-weasel.md)) that sits on the giant's lap or shoulder. |
| 2 | The giant swats at a murmuration of starlings as if it were a cloud of gnats. |
| 3 | The giant uses a [dagger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md) as a toothpick, a [greatsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/greatsword.md) as a letter opener, or a pair of [javelins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/javelin.md) as knitting needles. |
| 4 | The giant carefully lifts Humanoids (cradling their heads to avoid injury) to see and hear them better. |
| 5 | The giant exclaims with admiration at the fine detail and exquisite articulation of the characters' armor. |
| 6 | The giant fidgets with the skulls of Humanoids. |
| 7 | The giant drinks from a barrel as a human would from a waterskin. |
| 8 | The giant takes a messy bite from a large melon held in one hand. |

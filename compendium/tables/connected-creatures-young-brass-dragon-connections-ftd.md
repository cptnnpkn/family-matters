`dice: [](connected-creatures-young-brass-dragon-connections-ftd.md#^young-brass-dragon-connections)`

| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon.md) and a [young blue dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-blue-dragon.md) fight over territory. |
| 2 | A [young brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon.md) frequently visits a [couatl](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/couatl.md) who is charged with guarding an ancient temple, sharing stories to help the couatl pass the years. |
| 3 | A [lamia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/lamia.md) and a [young brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon.md) lair in the same desert ruin, mostly leaving each other alone—but the lamia hopes to corrupt the dragon. |
| 4 | A [young brass dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon.md) lair occasionally spawns [air elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) that roam around the area for a while, causing havoc before eventually dissipating. |
| 5 | A [young brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon.md) and a [weretiger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/weretiger.md) have become close friends as they try to keep a region safe from a growing horde of malicious gnolls. |
| 6 | A [young brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-brass-dragon.md) allowed a group of [cyclopes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) to shelter in the dragon's lair when they were harassed by a blue dragon. Now the cyclopes won't leave, so the dragon is trying to educate them. |

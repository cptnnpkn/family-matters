|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A flight of [pseudodragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md) has raised an orphaned [bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md), who is quickly growing too large for the group's usual activities. |
| 2 | A [knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) rescued a [bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) from sacrifice at the hands of a cult, and the two now travel together in search of wrongs to right. |
| 3 | A [bronze dragon wyrmling's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) murdered tutor rose as a [revenant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/revenant.md), and the dragon seeks anyone who can help obtain justice. |
| 4 | A [bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) has chosen a lair filled with [poisonous snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/poisonous-snake.md), admiring the elegance with which they slither through the flooded tunnels. |
| 5 | A [bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) has been captured by [sahuagin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) raiders and manipulated into serving as the band's icon and war leader. |
| 6 | A group of [merrow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) stole a [bronze dragon wyrmling's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) hoard, and the wyrmling is training a [plesiosaurus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/plesiosaurus.md) to help attack the merrow's stronghold. |

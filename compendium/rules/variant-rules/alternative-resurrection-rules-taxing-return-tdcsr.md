# Alternative Resurrection Rules: Taxing Return
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 215* 

Character death often becomes no more than a minor inconvenience in some campaigns. Once an adventuring party reaches a certain level, the spells available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife—including [revivify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/revivify.md), [raise dead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/raise-dead.md), and [resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resurrection.md)—make death no more than a temporary setback, potentially undermining one of the most significant elements of danger and threat in the campaign story. For players and GMs who wish to elevate the gravity of character death, the optional rules in this section offer three different approaches.

## Taxing Return

In a campaign that uses this house rule, whenever a character is restored to life, the process corrodes a fraction of their vitality, slowly consuming the body until it can no longer sustain life. Each time a character is brought back to life by a spell other than [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection.md), that character's Constitution score is permanently reduced by 1. This loss can't be restored except by use of a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. A character whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 in this way dies permanently and can't be returned to life by any means.

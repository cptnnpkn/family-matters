# Winter Wizardry
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, p. 147* 

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/chaptereight.webp#center)

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) yearns to rule Waterdeep as a tyrant, take over the Zhentarim, and use both seats of power to plunder and control the Sword Coast. He needs the gold in the Vault of Dragons to pay off Masked Lords and Zhentarim leaders whose support will be instrumental when the time comes to oust Lady [Laeral Silverhand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/laeral-silverhand-wdh.md) as Open Lord. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) has a long list of powerful enemies, among them the Harpers, Elminster of Shadowdale, Halaster Blackcloak of Undermountain, and the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. These enemies would quickly move against [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) if they learned he was hiding in Waterdeep. For his evil plans to succeed, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) must operate in the shadows for the time being.

## Facing Manshoon

A head-on battle with [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) isn't likely to go well for the characters. That said, the wizard's greatest weakness is that he has powerful enemies in Waterdeep. The risk of exposure keeps him hidden, and the characters can thwart him by furnishing his enemies with proof that he's alive (after a fashion) and operating in Waterdeep. When it comes to [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) clones, deciding to "let the city deal with it" is a wise course of action.

If the characters find themselves at the evil wizard's mercy, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) will gladly trade their pitiful lives for the [Stone of Golorr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/stone-of-golorr-wdh.md) and the keys to unlock the Vault of Dragons. In exchange for helping him get the gold, he promises the characters 10 percent of the trove (50,000 gp). [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) has no intention of honoring this agreement, but it can help buy the characters some time.

If the characters manage to kill [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) and the local authorities are made aware of the act, no murder charges are filed. Rather, the characters' actions are celebrated. [Laeral Silverhand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/laeral-silverhand-wdh.md) summons them to the Palace of Waterdeep to thank them officially, in her capacity as Open Lord. Sometime later, [Vajra Safahr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vajra-safahr-wdh.md) invites them to Blackstaff Tower to thank them for their service and offer them membership in Force Grey.

### Disrupting Manshoon's Operation

Characters can hinder [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) in the following ways.

#### Release the Barlgura

If the characters free the barlgura demon in K15 and allow it to roam Kolat Towers, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) loses many followers to the demon's rampage.

#### Report Manshoon

Delivering proof that [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) is hiding in Waterdeep to [Laeral Silverhand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/laeral-silverhand-wdh.md), [Mirt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mirt-wdh.md), the Harpers, Force Grey, the Blackstaff, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, the City Watch, or the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors triggers a far-reaching effort to oust him from the city. Such proof can be obtained from any of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s lieutenants, who can be captured and turned over for interrogation. These lieutenants include Sidra Romeir (K2), [Manafret Cherryport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manafret-cherryport-wdh.md) (K3), [Urstul Floxin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/urstul-floxin-wdh.md) (E5), Vevette Blackwater and Agorn Fuoco (E8), and [Havia Quickknife](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) and [Mookie Plush](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) (E10).

The ledger in E13 also contains proof of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s malfeasance. Giving it to [Laeral Silverhand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/laeral-silverhand-wdh.md), [Vajra Safahr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vajra-safahr-wdh.md), [Mirt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mirt-wdh.md), or a magister provides enough evidence for them to act on.

Once [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s whereabouts are established, the City Guard cordons off and surrounds Kolat Towers. The Blackstaff and the Watchful Order assist as needed. If the characters deactivated the force field, the siege is brief and [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s forces are routed. If the force field remains in place, the Watchful Order can deactivate it.

When all is said and done, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) is forced to retreat to his extradimensional sanctum. From there, he continues his search for the Vault of Dragons while fending off attackers.

#### Steal Manshoon's Spellbook

Stealing the spellbook from E13 causes [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) to slow his search for the Vault of Dragons while he either tries to replace it or sends a simulacrum (see appendix B) and other forces to retrieve it.

## Kolat Towers

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers.webp#center)

This dilapidated, two-towered edifice stands tall in the Southern Ward. Its neighbors are aware of the magical force field that surrounds it, and they can see light from [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells spilling out of the windows. Despite these persistent magical effects, most folk believe the structure is abandoned. Others think it's haunted by the ghosts of the Kolat brothers. They're wrong, of course.

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) posts no visible guards outside Kolat Towers, since he wants others to believe the site is abandoned. The evil wizard and his underlings come and go using teleportation circles inside the towers.

### Force Field

An invisible field of magical force surrounds and covers Kolat Towers. The field is paper-thin and stands just outside the outer wall of the estate, extending upward to contain the buildings in their entirety. Nothing can pass through the barrier, including air, fog, rain, and snow. Creatures that don't realize the field is there bounce off it, with birds especially prone to striking it. The ground outside the field is regularly littered with the tiny corpses of birds that broke their necks hitting it, and street cleaners come by every morning to sweep them up.

#### Digging under the Force Field

There are no openings in the force field, which extends 1 foot underground. It takes 1 hour for a character with a shovel to dig a hole deep enough for a Medium creature to squeeze through, going under the field to the other side of the towers' outer wall. Since Kolat Towers is surrounded by other buildings, there's a 75% chance that any digging attracts `2d6` members of the City Watch ([veterans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)), who put a stop to it.

#### Using Magic to Bypass the Force Field

Characters can use magic such as a [dimension door](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door.md) or [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md) spell to teleport from one side of the force field to the other. A [disintegrate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disintegrate.md) spell or a successful [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 19) spell cast at the field creates a 10-foot-square opening that lasts for 1 minute.

#### Destroying the Force Field

A magic rune in K18 generates the force field. Destroying that rune ends the effect.

### Kolat Towers Features

The following general features apply to Kolat Towers:

- Kolat Towers is a multistory structure, with each level standing 20 feet higher than the one below it. Its rooms have 15-foot-high ceilings, with 7-foot-high doorways connecting them.  
- Climbing the outside walls without equipment requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.  
- Each of the doors in the towers, as well as the door in the outer wall, is made of iron-bound oak and has AC 16, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If a door is locked, it can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), [Manafret Cherryport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manafret-cherryport-wdh.md), and [Havia Quickknife](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) have keys to the locked doors.  
- Windows have leaded frames and dirty glass panes. They are latched from within and swing inward on iron hinges. A successful DC 11 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens a window from the outside.  
- Unless otherwise noted, all areas are brightly lit by [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on wall sconces.  
- Some of the staircases in Kolat Towers are invisible. They are revealed by a [see invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell or similar magic. A creature traversing stairs it can't see can move on the steps at half speed without any problem. A creature that moves any faster than half speed must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or slip, tumble down the stairs, and fall [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) at the bottom of them.  

> [!note] Kolat Towers Lore
> 
> With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check, a character can recall the following information about Kolat Towers. An NPC familiar with Waterdeep's history, such as [Mirt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mirt-wdh.md) or Volo, can also provide this information.
> 
> - Kolat Towers once belonged to two eccentric brothers, Duhlark and Alcedor Kolat. Both were wizards.  
> - Over time, the brothers discovered new ways to harness magic, but Duhlark became paranoid that others might steal their secrets. He encased Kolat Towers in a magical force field.  
> - Duhlark's paranoia continued to grow, until he suspected Alcedor of selling their secrets. Alcedor left the towers, never to be heard from again, and Duhlark became a recluse who died in his own fortress.

### Areas of Kolat Towers

The following encounter locations are keyed to map 8.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Kolat Towers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Kolat Towers, Level 1 (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-l1.webp#gallery)

#### K1. Storeroom

The outer door is locked from the inside, and the room has neither heat nor light sources. Crates stacked around the room are packed with meat, and bear the seal of the Fellowship of Salters, Packers, and Joiners.

#### K2. Dining Room

This room contains the following features:

- Three Zhents in black armor sit around a stone dining table, playing Three-Dragon Ante (a card game). The table is set with silver.  
- Eight moth-eaten banners hang from the walls. Each bears an arcane sigil that represents a different one of the eight schools of magic.  

##### Zhents

The card players are Sidra Romeir (LE female Calishite human [veteran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) and two subordinates (LE male Tethyrian human [thugs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md)). Since the force field around Kolat Towers keeps out riffraff, Sidra assumes the characters are guests of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) arriving for a clandestine meeting. If the characters give her no reason to believe otherwise, she and her thugs escort them wherever they ask to go. If it becomes clear that the characters don't belong in the towers, Sidra and her thugs attack. Combat in this area draws the attention of [Manafret Cherryport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manafret-cherryport-wdh.md) in K3, who investigates.

Sidra wears a [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) (see "Teleporter Rings").

##### Treasure

Silverware on the table is worth 100 gp.

#### K3. Kitchen

Mouthwatering scents fill this room, which contains the following features:

- If he hasn't already been drawn elsewhere, a portly halfling stands atop a stool and cooks at an iron stove.  
- A green, ghostly hand floats above a trellis table, holding a knife and cutting carrots and celery.  
- A staircase curves up one wall, leading to K7.  

##### Zhent Cook

The halfling, [Manafret Cherryport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manafret-cherryport-wdh.md), is one of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s lieutenants. He loves to cook, and uses his mage hand cantrip to cut vegetables. He assumes the characters are intruders unless convinced otherwise. Any ability check to do so is made with disadvantage, since Manafret knows that [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) would have informed him if guests were expected. If the mage suspects the characters are intruders, he surreptitiously pours a vial of assassin's blood (DC 10 Constitution save, on a failure 10 (`3d6`) poison damage and [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 24 hours, half damage on a success and not [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)) into the stew before asking them to taste it and give him an honest critique. He then cries out to the guards in K2 and attacks. Combat in this area draws the attention of the Zhents in areas K2 and K7, who investigate.

[Manafret](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manafret-cherryport-wdh.md) is a lightfoot halfling [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), with these changes:

- Manafret is neutral evil and has 31 (`9d6`) hit points.  
- He has these racial traits: He is Small, and his walking speed is 25 feet. He can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. He has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). He speaks Common and Halfling.  

Manafret wears a teleporter ring (see "Teleporter Rings").

##### Treasure

A cupboard holds a dozen jars of herbs and spices. Among them is a flask labeled "Assassin's Blood," which contains six doses of the poison.

#### K4. Musty Library

This musty room is situated at the bottom of the main tower, and it has no door on level 1. It contains the following features:

- A suit of dented plate armor stands in the center of the room.  
- Tomes are packed into built-in stone bookshelves, with a tall alcove above each shelf holding a gargoyle. (Two of these sculptures are living [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md).) An in-progress game of Dragonchess sits on a marble table in a reading nook.  
- A stone staircase spirals up to K6.  

##### Gargoyles

The two real gargoyles are indistinguishable from the inanimate gargoyle statues in the high alcoves. When intruders start poking around the room, the gargoyles swoop down and attack.

##### Tomes

Any character who spends an hour searching the bookshelves finds a fat tome titled *Flumph Mating Rituals*, with an embossed image of two flumphs on the cover, their tendrils entwined. The cover is a false one, wrapping around a tome bound in dragon hide-a disguised spellbook that contains the following wizard spells: [arcane lock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md), [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md), [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md), [counterspell](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/counterspell.md), [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkvision.md), [dimension door](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door.md), [find familiar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar.md), [levitate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md), [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md), and [unseen servant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/unseen-servant.md). (You can replace any of these spells with a spell of the same level.)

##### Treasure

The Dragonchess set is made of handcarved ivory and is worth 500 gp.

#### K5. Garbage-Filled Room

This room is on level 1 of the outermost tower but isn't accessible from that floor. It reeks of garbage and has the following features:

- Ankle-deep refuse fills the chamber.  
- Black scorch marks stretch from floor to ceiling along the walls and the stairs, which lead up to K10.  

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s servants throw their garbage here. The Kolat brothers created some magic items in this room, and an experiment gone awry caused the scorch marks.

#### K6. Main Tower Landing and Ledge

![Kolat Towers, Level 2 (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-l2.webp#center)

Level 2 of the main tower has the following features:

- A stone landing with no railings has a door leading to K7 and a stone spiral staircase descending to K4. An invisible staircase with no railings (see "Kolat Towers Features"), hugs the wall as it climbs from the landing to K11.  
- Across from the landing, a wide stone ledge protrudes from the northeast wall beneath a window. A pair of identical wooden chests sits atop the ledge. (One chest is real. The other is a [mimic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md).)  

##### Ledge

There's no easy way to access the ledge, which is 8 feet away from the landing and at the same height. Characters can try to jump onto the ledge, or they can hook a rope onto the railing on the level above (K11) and swing across the gap. They can also use magic to cross. Anyone who falls off the landing or the ledge lands in K4, 20 feet below.

##### Mimic

A character who touches the mimic becomes adhered to it. The mimic attacks if disturbed or when a character inspects the real chest next to it.

##### Treasure

The genuine chest is unlocked and contains thirteen items, each of which can be used as an arcane focus: two crystals (worth 10 gp each), an orb (worth 20 gp), four rods (worth 10 gp each), and six wands (worth 10 gp each).

#### K7. Reading Room

This room contains the following features:

- A burly half-orc clad in black leather armor sits in an overstuffed chair in the northernmost corner of the room, reading a book.  
- Large framed pictures of cities and landscapes hang on the walls, and a worn, blood-spattered rug covers the floor. Other furnishings include a pair of rocking chairs, a couch, and an ottoman.  
- Mouthwatering scents rise from a staircase that curves down to the kitchen (K3).  

##### Zhent

[Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md) the Terror is reading a copy of "Volo's Guide to Monsters", autographed on the title page by the author with an added note that reads, in Common: "For [Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md). I hope you find the orc chapter illuminating!"

[Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md) is a half-orc [thug](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md), with these changes:

- [Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md) is neutral evil.  
- He has these racial traits: When reduced to 0 hit points, he drops to 1 hit point instead (but can't do this again until he finishes a long rest). He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He speaks Common and Orc.  

[Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md) values his own well-being above all else. He is initially indifferent toward intruders. If [Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md) believes the characters aren't a threat, he's happy to chat with them about the inhabitants and the layout of Kolat Towers. He has never visited [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s extraplanar sanctum, but he does know that the teleportation circle in K22 is the way to get there.

Combat in this area draws the attention of [Manafret Cherryport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manafret-cherryport-wdh.md) in K3, who investigates.

##### Treasure

[Yorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yorn-wdh.md) carries 36 cp, 20 sp, 12 gp, 8 taols, and a gem-studded ivory toothpick (worth 25 gp) in a pouch.

#### K8. Apprentice Bedroom

This narrow room contains the following features:

- Three single beds are bunched less than an arm's length apart beneath a staircase that leads up to K12.  
- At the foot of each bed is a wooden chest.  

The Kolat brothers once took on apprentices, who slept here. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) now allows his own apprentices—Ered Payno, Havi Termock, and Savara Firethorn—to do the same. All three can be found in K15.

##### Treasure

Inside each chest is a set of [common clothes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/common-clothes.md), a spare spell [component pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/component-pouch.md), [candles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/candle.md), ink, pens, [paper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/paper-one-sheet.md), and `3d6` gp. Each chest also holds a spellbook that contains all the spells its owner has prepared. In addition, Ered's spellbook contains [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md), [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md), and [lightning bolt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lightning-bolt.md); Havi's spellbook contains [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md), [detect thoughts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md), and [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md); and Savara's spellbook contains [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md), [phantasmal force](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-force.md), and [phantom steed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantom-steed.md).

#### K9. Bridge and Walkway

A wooden bridge connects the two towers 20 feet above the ground, and a walkway attached to the bridge encircles the outside of the outer tower. The bridge and the tower walkway lack railings. Their planks and stones groan and crack underfoot but are safe to walk on.

#### K10. Wizard Statue

This level of the outer tower consists of a landing and a narrow ledge with the following features:

- The landing is 10 feet square and is met by two staircases. One descends 20 feet to K5, and one ascends 20 feet to K20.  
- The narrow ledge built into the southeast wall has a life-size statue of a bearded human wizard standing atop it. The wizard looks angry and is leveling a stone wand at the door to K9.  

##### Statue

The statue depicts Duhlark Kolat, and a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. The first time a character steps onto the landing, the statue levitates 1 foot above the ledge and intones the following warning in Common:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I am Duhlark Kolat, the great wizard and master of this tower! How dare you invade my home! Leave at once or be destroyed by magic beyond your comprehension!"
^3f2

The threat is empty, but the statue continues to levitate for 1 minute before sinking back down to the ledge. The magic resets after 1 hour. While it is levitating, the statue can be easily pushed or pulled around.

Casting [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the statue while it's floating causes it to fall, topple off the ledge, and shatter in K5 below. Anyone in that area when the statue falls must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage.

#### K11. Laboratory

![Kolat Towers, Level 3 (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-l3.webp#center)

This room consists of a ledge connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases (see "Kolat Towers Features"). One staircase descends 20 feet to K6, and the other climbs 20 feet to K15. The area contains the following features:

- Shattered glass covers the floor, and a large wooden trellis table has been knocked on its side.  
- A large empty cabinet dominates the back wall.  

This laboratory has been picked clean by [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) and contains nothing of value.

#### K12. Staff Display

This room contains the following features:

- A half-dozen staffs of various styles are hung proudly on the walls at the top of the landing.  
- A staircase descends to K8.  

##### Staffs

Each staff is different in construction and style: a twisted birch branch, a sturdy oak dowel, a glittering haft of stone, a steel pole carved with blue runes, a dimpled copper staff topped with a copper crescent moon, and a blown-glass cane capped with a black marble orb.

All six [staffs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/flying-staff-wdh.md) animate and attack interlopers who enter the area without being escorted by [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) or one of his lieutenants. The staffs have the same statistics as [flying swords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/flying-sword.md), except they deal bludgeoning damage on a hit. If a fight breaks out in this area, the creatures in K14 come to investigate.

#### K13. Holding Cell

The door to this room has a narrow, barred window set into it. The door is locked and trapped (see below). As the characters approach the door, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A raspy voice calls out from beyond the door. "If you be good, let us rid these towers of evil's stench. If you be evil, open the door so we may battle, and my eternal boredom can end." Beyond the door's barred window, a gargoyle lurks in a stone cell, challenging you in a low growl. "Come on, then!"
^3f7

##### Trapped Door

A [glyph of warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) spell has been cast on the door, set to trigger when it is opened by anyone other than [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md). The glyph, which resembles an ornate letter M, can be found with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The glyph targets the creature that opens the door with a [blindness/deafness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blindness-deafness.md) spell (save DC 18).

##### Lady Gondafrey

Duhlark Kolat long ago trapped a magical experiment in this cell: a [gargoyle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) that has been imbued with the personality of a human knight of Tyr (god of justice) named [Lady Gondafrey](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lady-gondafrey-wdh.md). This gargoyle has an Intelligence score of 10 and an alignment of lawful good. It speaks Common, and its face looks more humanoid than gargoyle. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) is amused by the creature, so he keeps it alive but locked in the cell.

If the characters free [Lady Gondafrey](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lady-gondafrey-wdh.md), she offers to fight alongside them; however, she quickly turns against any character who exhibits cruel or unlawful behavior. She can offer helpful information about Kolat Towers, and she is familiar with both the layout of the towers and the current occupants of the place. She knows that [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) resides in an extraplanar sanctum accessible through a teleportation circle that his lieutenants can activate using special rings. The gargoyle doesn't know where the teleportation circle is located, nor does she know why Duhlark transferred her consciousness into her present form.

The gargoyle retains fragmented memories of the life of [Lady Gondafrey](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lady-gondafrey-wdh.md), a native Waterdavian who served in the City Watch. After identifying Duhlark Kolat as a suspect in several local disappearances, she darkened his doorstep in 1379 DR, the Year of the Lost Keep. Annoyed by this invasion of his privacy and not in his right mind, Duhlark captured [Lady Gondafrey](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lady-gondafrey-wdh.md), used a spell to meld her form with that of a gargoyle, and imprisoned her.

If the gargoyle travels with the party, roll a `d10` each day at dawn. On a roll of 1, [Lady Gondafrey](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lady-gondafrey-wdh.md)'s alignment becomes chaotic evil for 24 hours as the gargoyle's innate demeanor exerts itself. In this state, the creature tries to orchestrate the characters' deaths, going so far as to attack lone characters.

#### K14. Servants' Quarters

This room contains the following features:

- Furnishings include four beds, a small table with four chairs, and tattered window curtains.  
- Four Zhent [thugs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) relax here-one trying to rest, two others playing cards, and the fourth sitting on the edge of a bed, re-stringing a heavy crossbow.  

The thugs work for [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) and leap up to attack anyone they don't recognize as one of their own. A successful DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check convinces these Zhents that the characters are their allies.

##### Treasure

Resting in small piles and neat stacks on the table are 74 cp, 52 sp, 19 gp, and 4 taols.

#### K15. Summoning Chamber

![Kolat Towers, Level 4 (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-l4.webp#center)

This room is connected to the levels above and below by invisible staircases (see "Kolat Towers Features"), one descending 20 feet to K11 and the other climbing 20 feet to K16. This area contains the following features:

- A 10-foot-diameter circle of runes has been drawn on the floor in blood that is now dried. Smoke billows from four iron braziers placed around the circle.  
- Three [apprentice wizards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/apprentice-wizard-mpmm.md) (see appendix B) stand outside the circle, chanting an incantation. A [barlgura](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) is slumped motionless within the circle.  

The three wizards here are [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s apprentices—Ered Payno (LE male Damaran human), Havi Termock (CE female Chondathan human), and Savara Firethorn (NE female Tethyrian human). Each wears a teleporter ring (see "Teleporter Rings"). The magical incantation that the three are reciting has quelled the barlgura and rendered it [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). If any of them stop chanting, the demon awakes and becomes enraged, though it remains bound within the circle. Whenever it takes damage, the barlgura can attempt a DC 10 Charisma check. On a successful check, it breaks out of the circle and attacks any creature it can reach.

Freeing the barlgura disrupts [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s operation, forcing the wizard to spend time and resources defeating the fiend and replacing slain underlings.

#### K16. Construct Workshop

![Kolat Towers, Level 5 (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-l5.webp#center)

The invisible staircase from K15 ends in front of a closed door. The door is unlocked and opens into the room, which contains the following:

- Bits of clay, stone, bone, and metal litter the floor and cover a wooden table in the middle of the room.  
- The floor creaks and tilts slightly when stepped on, and it can be seen to be detached from the walls. Two oversized iron clamps on opposite sides of the room hold the floor in place. Each of these rusty mechanisms is attached to an iron lever.  
- A wooden staircase once climbed 20 feet to the next level, but it has partially collapsed.  

The Kolat brothers once crafted constructs in this workshop. The magical clamped floor was built as a precaution in case one of the experiments went berserk.

When a creature that doesn't work for [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s Zhentarim enters this room without being escorted, the metal scraps on the floor fly together, forming a suit of [animated armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) that attacks. When the armor is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, it tries to pull one of the levers on its next turn.

##### Floor Clamps

Pulling a lever is an action that causes both clamps to release the floor, which is then magically driven upward into the ceiling. Creatures standing on the floor are knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw as they slam into the ceiling, taking 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The floor then settles a few feet below the ceiling, cutting off access to the stairs down to K15 but leaving characters free to climb up the collapsed staircase to K17. (The magical floor was designed to prevent a berserk golem from reaching the lower chambers of the towers, and potentially the city beyond, while the Kolat brothers dealt with it.) After 10 minutes, the floor descends to its normal level and the clamps lock it down again.

##### Partially Collapsed Stairs

A creature can climb the stairs to K17 with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the check fails, the creature falls 10 feet.

#### K17. Flesh Golem

![Kolat Towers, Level 6 (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-l6.webp#center)

This unlit hallway contains the following features:

- Any character who inspects the hall for traps and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check notices 1-inch-diameter holes drilled into the walls at ankle height, set at regular intervals along the length of the passage.  
- A [flesh golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/flesh-golem.md) stands in front of the door to K18.  
- A one-way secret door is set into the innermost wall.  

##### Golem Trap

The flesh golem was created by Duhlark Kolat. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) chose to leave it here and instructed his lieutenants not to disturb it. It moves to attack anyone other than Duhlark who approaches within 10 feet of it. A character disguised as Duhlark (using the statue in K10 as a model) can fool the golem with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check.

The golem stands on a pressure plate. When it steps off the plate to attack someone out of its reach, the weight on the plate is lifted, causing poison gas to erupt from the holes in the walls. When the trap triggers, each creature in the hall must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas lingers for 1 minute unless dispersed with a [gust of wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell or similar magic. While the gas persists, a creature in the hall must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. The golem is immune to the poison gas.

##### One-Way Secret Door

A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the secret door that leads to K19. This door opens normally only from inside K19, and only a [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic can force it open from this side.

#### K18. Arcane Rune

This unlit hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. It contains the following features:

- An elaborate rune is inscribed on the back wall at the southernmost end of the hall. (The rune isn't visible from the doorway to K17.)  
- A secret door is set into the innermost wall.  

##### Arcane Rune

A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic reveals a powerful aura of conjuration magic around the rune. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that this rune sustains the force field around Kolat Towers, and that the rune can be destroyed. It has AC 10, 22 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The rune can't be dispelled normally, but each successful dispel magic cast on it (DC 19) deals 16 (`3d10`) force damage to it.

The first time damage is dealt to the rune, a [red slaad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/red-slaad.md) magically springs forth from it and attacks all creatures in the hallway.

When the rune is destroyed, the force field around Kolat Towers disappears.

##### Secret Door

A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the secret door that leads to K19.

#### K19. Duhlark's Bedroom

This room is accessible through either of the secret doors that lead to areas K17 and K18. It contains the following features:

- A [flameskull](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) bobs in the middle of the room, which is choked with dust and cobwebs.  
- An oval canopy bed veiled in cobwebs sits across from two narrow bookshelves.  
- The room smells like a tomb.  

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) found Duhlark Kolat's skeletal remains in the bed and transformed his skull into a flameskull. He left the rest of the bones alone, hidden behind cobwebs. The flameskull attacks anyone other than [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) who confronts it, shouting, "Get out of my house!" between casting spells and throwing off fire rays.

##### Bookshelves

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) removed any tomes of value from the bedroom, leaving noticeable gaps on the shelves between mundane books on a variety of esoteric subjects.

Among the volumes on one shelf is a false book titled *The Man from Damara*—a wooden block painted to resemble a book, which is wired to a secret compartment in the base of the shelf. A character can detect the shelf and discern how to open it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Tugging on the book causes the compartment to pop open, revealing Duhlark's [wand of binding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-binding.md) hidden inside.

#### K20. Alcedor's Private Library

![Kolat Towers, Level Outer (Player Version)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/kolat-towers-outer.webp#center)

This room has the following features:

- A tall oak bookshelf contains a few scattered books (all mundane and worthless), but is mostly bare. Above the bookshelf hangs a beautifully crafted sign that reads "Alcedor" in Common.  
- A staircase descends 20 feet to K10.  

#### K21. Duhlark's Private Library

This room has the following features:

- A tall oak bookshelf holds a few dozen books. Above the bookshelf hangs a beautifully crafted sign that reads "Duhlark" in Common.  
- A staircase ascends 20 feet to K22.  

##### Bookshelf

The bookshelf holds thirty books in total. If any of them are disturbed, they fly off the shelves and form a swarm that attacks all creatures in the room. The [book collection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/swarm-of-books-wdh.md) has the statistics of a [swarm of bats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-bats.md), with these changes:

- The books lack the Echolocation and Keen Hearing traits.  
- Replace the swarm's Bites attack option with a Slam attack option that deals the same amount of bludgeoning damage.  

If there are no creatures to attack on its turn, the book collection returns to the bookshelf. The books are otherwise nonmagical and cover a wide array of subjects.

#### K22. Teleportation Circle

A staircase rising from K21 leads to this highest chamber of the outer tower. It contains the following features:

- A [spectator](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/spectator.md) floats in the middle of the room, and four [flying snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/flying-snake.md) flutter above the rafters.  
- Runes inscribed on the floor form a large, faintly glowing circle.  
- Five wooden treasure chests with sturdy padlocks rest against the walls.  

##### Guardians

The spectator guards the treasure chests and attacks intruders who aren't being escorted by [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) or one of his lieutenants. The flying snakes join the battle, fighting as allies of the spectator.

##### Teleportation Circle

The teleportation circle functions as described under the [spell of the same name](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) in the "Player's Handbook". Additionally, a creature wearing a [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) (see "Teleporter Rings"), can use this circle to access the teleportation circle in [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s sanctum (E1). A [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) that is brought within 5 feet of the circle begins to hum softly.

##### Treasure Chests

The padlocks on the chests are illusory but feel real to the touch. A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic reveals an aura of illusion magic around each one. Attempts to pick or break the locks fail, but a [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic causes a lock to open. *Chest 1* has the image of an anvil carved into its lid. It contains a set of smith's tools (worth 20 gp). *Chest 2 * has iron bands and contains a set of painter's supplies (worth 10 gp), as well as three small pots of colored paint (blue, red, and yellow). *Chest 3* has tiny clawed feet and contains six blank spellbooks with leather covers (worth 50 gp each). *Chest 4* has a flat lid with a city scene painted on it. It contains a scholar's pack (worth 40 gp) and a book of Dwarvish phrases. A character who doesn't speak Dwarvish can use the book to communicate on a rudimentary level with friendly dwarves. *Chest 5* is inlaid with silver and topped with a silver statuette of a rearing hippogriff (worth 25 gp). Inside is a wooden rack that holds eight glass vials—six containing [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) and two containing individual doses of [essence of ether](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/essence-of-ether.md) (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). The poison can be identified with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check.

## Extradimensional Sanctum

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s extradimensional sanctum exists in a finite demiplane. Created by the original [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), it is known to the wizard's clones, and it currently serves as the lair of the clone described in this adventure.

Outside [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s sanctum, the demiplane is a vast void filled with swirling purple mist. Any creature that enters this mist is teleported to E1 and must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

There are no cardinal directions in this extradimensional space; compasses spin futilely in the absence of north, south, east, and west.

### Sanctum Features

These features apply to all areas in the extradimensional sanctum:

- Rooms have 10-foot-high ceilings, with 8-foot-high passages and 7-foot-high doorways connecting them. The walls, floors, and ceilings throughout are made of seamless alabaster.  
- Doors are made of iron and have AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A locked door can be picked by someone who makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. As an action, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) or his simulacrum can lock or unlock any door in the sanctum by touch.  
- Except where noted, areas of the sanctum are brightly lit by [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on wall sconces.  

### Teleporter Rings

To access [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s extraplanar sanctum, one needs a [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md): a brass signet ring bearing a stylized M, and which emanates an aura of conjuration magic when targeted by a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) gives these rings to his most trusted servants.

As an action, a creature wearing a teleporter ring can activate the teleportation circle either in K22 or E1, teleporting itself and up to six other willing creatures from one circle to the other.

### Areas of the Sanctum

The following locations are keyed to map 8.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Sanctum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/sanctum-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/sanctum-players.webp#gallery)

#### E1. Arrival Point

This room is the extradimensional sanctum's anchor to the Material Plane, and one can teleport to this chamber from other places on the Material Plane. The room has the following features:

- A teleportation circle is inscribed on the alabaster floor here. Characters teleported to this area from K22 appear within the circle.  
- The ceiling and three of the walls are made of 6-inch thick sheets of transparent glass, through which the swirling purple mist that fills the demiplane can be seen. The fourth wall is made of alabaster and has a locked iron door set into it (leading to E2).  
- A black-robed female human with a bald, scarred head watches this room through a glass window set into the wall of another room (E3).  

##### Dreadful Host

The figure watching through the window is [Kaevja Cynavern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kaevja-cynavern-wdh.md) (see E3), and she can see through the purple mist between the two rooms easily enough. She uses a [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell to contact [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) as soon as the characters arrive. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) sends his simulacrum (see appendix B) to unlock the door to E2 and greet the new arrivals. It takes 1 minute for the simulacrum to arrive (from E7), during which time Kaevja uses another [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell to inform a random character that "Your gracious host is on the way, and looks forward to meeting you."

When the simulacrum arrives, it passes itself off as [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) as it welcomes the characters to its extradimensional sanctum. It offers a guided tour, gesturing for the characters to enter E2 ahead of it. If they comply, it triggers the alarm in E2 and attacks.

##### Glass Walls

Each 5-foot section of glass wall has AC 13, 30 hit points, and immunity to acid, poison, and psychic damage. The purple mist that fills the demiplane doesn't enter this area even if the glass is shattered.

##### Teleportation Circle

The teleportation circle functions as described under the [spell of the same name](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md) in the "Player's Handbook". Additionally, a creature wearing a [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) (see "Teleporter Rings"), can use this circle to access the teleportation circle in Kolat Towers (K22). A [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) that is brought within 5 feet of the circle begins to hum softly.

#### E2. Foyer

The door to E1 is locked. All other doors leading from this room are unlocked. This foyer has the following features:

- Set into the alabaster floor is a large symbol in black marble, depicting a winged snake biting a coin. Characters recognize this as the symbol of the Zhentarim. (The coin conceals an alarm mechanism.)  
- Hanging on the walls are twelve metal masks bearing human-like visages.  

##### Alarm Mechanism

The 1-foot-diameter, disk-shaped tile that serves as the coin in the Zhentarim symbol is actually a pressure plate. When pressed or stepped on, it sounds a magic gong that can be heard throughout the sanctum. The alarm can be disabled by someone who makes a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but it triggers accidentally if the check fails by 5 or more. The alarm brings the following defenders, who attack all intruders in the room:

- [Kaevja Cynavern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kaevja-cynavern-wdh.md) (see E3)  
- The [Manshoon simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-simulacrum-wdh.md) (see E7)  
- Vevette Blackwater and Agorn Fuoco (see E8)  
- [Havia Quickknife](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) and [Mookie Plush](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) (see E10)  

#### Alarm Responders

If the characters manage to overcome all these foes, they are free to explore the sanctum. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) awaits them in E12.

Characters who are reduced to 0 hit points by [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s defenders are knocked [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). If the entire party is defeated, the [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) characters are stripped of their spellbooks and magic items (including any [teleporter rings](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) they obtained in Kolat Towers). They then awaken in a back alley of Waterdeep with 1 hit point each. If the characters return to Kolat Towers, they find the place cleared out and the teleportation circle in K22 permanently dispelled.

##### Masks of Manshoon

The masks belong to [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) and have been worn by him in the past. A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic reveals an aura of evocation magic around each one. Any creature that dons a mask takes 9 (`2d8`) lightning damage. Once this effect triggers, the mask becomes nonmagical and harmless.

#### E3. Guard Station

A 5-foot-square window in this area looks out toward E1. Unless she has been drawn elsewhere, [Kaevja Cynavern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kaevja-cynavern-wdh.md) stands watch in front of the window.

Kaevja was a Red Wizard of Thay until she saw an opportunity to study magic under [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md). Before he accepted her, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) forced her to remove her distinctive Thayan head tattoos and to trade in her Red Wizard robes for black ones.

[Kaevja Cynavern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kaevja-cynavern-wdh.md) is a female Mulan human [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), with these changes:

- Kaevja is lawful evil. She knows Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Elvish.  
- She has the [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spell prepared instead of the [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md) spell, and she carries a yellow *elemental gem*.  

In battle, Kaevja breaks the *elemental gem*, summoning an [earth elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) and commanding it to attack her enemies.

#### E4. Pantry

This room contains the following features:

- Floor-to-ceiling shelves are stuffed with breads, cheeses, dried meats, nuts, and a few baskets of fresh produce.  
- Two barrels labeled "WATER" and two labeled "ALE" are crammed into a corner.  

#### E5. Laboratory

This room contains the following features:

- Beakers, bottles, and test tubes are set on a marble table in the middle of this room, next to a basin of water.  
- One staircase descends 10 feet to E2, and another ascends 10 feet to E6.  

##### Urstul Floxin

If he survived earlier encounters with the characters, [Urstul Floxin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/urstul-floxin-wdh.md) (see appendix B) stands at the table, dourly scrubbing lab equipment. He is being punished for allowing the [Stone of Golorr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/stone-of-golorr-wdh.md) to slip through his fingers (during the events of chapter 3). Nevertheless, he remains loyal to [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md). If he is confronted, Urstul feigns anger toward the wizard and offers to help the characters defeat him, but this ruse can be seen through by someone who makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check. Given the chance, Urstul leads the characters to [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), then attacks them to prove his unwavering loyalty in front of his master.

If the characters fall for Urstul's ruse but nevertheless demand that he relinquish his weapons in order to accompany them, the Zhent assassin laughs at them and attacks.

#### E6. Binding Chamber

A circle inscribed with runes is carved into the alabaster floor of this room. It radiates an aura of abjuration magic when targeted by a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic.

[Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) uses the circle to bind extraplanar creatures. When a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend is summoned inside the circle, it can't voluntarily leave that area until its summoner uses an action to suppress the circle's magic for 1 minute. The magic is also suppressed if any part of the circle falls within an [antimagic field](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field.md), or if [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 17) is successfully cast on it.

#### E7. Manshoon's Simulacrum

This room is extremely cold and contains the following features:

- Frigid air blows into the room through small vents in the floor. In the middle of the room is an open sarcophagus carved from ice, which contains a humanoid figure made of snow.  
- The back wall is made of 5-inch-thick curved glass. Frost covers the glass, partially blotting out the swirling purple mist of the demiplane beyond.  

##### Simulacrum

If it hasn't been summoned elsewhere, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s simulacrum (see appendix B) is standing before the glass wall with its back to the door. The simulacrum resembles a robed wizard with long black hair, pale skin, and an articulated metal left hand and forearm. Its face is concealed behind a steel mask that bears a smiling visage. The simulacrum attacks anyone it doesn't recognize.

##### Extreme Cold

The rules for [extreme cold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/extreme-cold.md) (see chapter 5 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide") apply in this room.

##### Glass Wall

Each 5-foot section of glass wall has AC 13, 30 hit points, and immunity to acid, poison, and psychic damage. The purple mist that fills the demiplane doesn't enter this room even if the glass is shattered.

##### Simulacrum Sarcophagus

This ice-carved container weighs 1,000 pounds and begins to melt if taken out of the room. The snow figure in the sarcophagus is part of the material component of a [simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/simulacrum.md) spell. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) can use it to create a new simulacrum if his current one is destroyed.

#### E8. Reading Room

This room contains the following features:

- Delightful warmth radiates from a brazier of green flame encircled by eight cushioned chairs.  
- Unless they've been drawn elsewhere, two of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s lieutenants are here: Vevette Blackwater (CE female Tethyrian human [swashbuckler](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/swashbuckler-mpmm.md); see appendix B) and Agorn Fuoco (NE male Turami human [bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bard-mpmm.md); see appendix B). Vevette is relaxing in a chair, while Agorn strums a lyre.  
- An alabaster staircase ascends 10 feet to E9.  

##### Zhents

Vevette and Agorn are two of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s most trusted followers. Vevette commands the wizard's forces against the Xanathar Guild, while Agorn commands those who oppose the Zhents that aren't loyal to [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md). At the moment, they are resting in the sanctum while awaiting orders from [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md).

##### Green Flame Brazier

A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic reveals an aura of evocation magic around the brazier. The brazier casts a [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md) spell (save DC 15) centered on itself whenever a creature in the room speaks the words "green flame" aloud. Once the brazier has cast this spell, it can't do so again for another 24 hours. Agorn knows this feature of the brazier, and he uses it in combat if the situation is desperate.

#### E9. Library

Alabaster shelves line every wall and jut out into the center of this room, all of them packed with books that deal with subjects of interest to wizards. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) has amassed a sizable collection, including ten rare volumes he removed from Duhlark Kolat's collection.

##### Treasure

Each rare book is worth 50 gp, and the entire collection is worth 5,000 gp.

#### E10. Audience Chamber

High-ranking Zhents who desire an audience with [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) come here. The room contains the following features:

- The area is split into two levels, with alabaster steps climbing 3 feet to a smaller raised platform overlooking the larger area. The platform is bare except for three golden banners hanging on the back wall, each displaying the symbol of the Zhentarim—a black, winged snake biting a coin.  
- The lower part of the room contains a black marble table surrounded by high-backed wooden chairs. The table stands out in stark contrast against the alabaster walls and floor.  
- If they haven't been drawn elsewhere, two of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s followers are sparring and engaged in mock fisticuffs atop the table.  

##### Zhents

Two female lightfoot halflings—[Havia Quickknife](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) and [Mookie Plush](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md)—believe that [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) is the rightful leader of the Zhentarim. They serve him fearlessly, and will sacrifice themselves to ensure that his plans come to fruition. They are [martial arts adepts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/martial-arts-adept-mpmm.md) (see appendix B), with these changes:

- Havia and Mookie are lawful evil.  
- They have 49 (`11d6 + 11`) hit points each.  
- They have these racial traits: They are Small, and their walking speed is 25 feet. They can move through the space of a Medium or larger creature. They have advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). They speak Common and Halfling.  

Havia and Mookie each wear a [teleporter ring](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/teleporter-ring-wdh.md) (see "Teleporter Rings").

#### E11. Zhent Quarters

This room contains the following features:

- Pressed against the walls of this room are five wooden beds (three sized for humans, two for halflings).  
- Next to each bed is a wooden chest.  
- An alabaster staircase descends to E12.  

[Kaevja Cynavern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kaevja-cynavern-wdh.md), Vevette Blackwater, Agorn Fuoco, [Havia Quickknife](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md), and [Mookie Plush](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhent-martial-arts-adept-wdh.md) all sleep here.

##### Treasure

In addition to folded clothes and worthless personal effects, each of the chests holds treasure.

Kaevja's chest contains a gold amulet inset with a red crystal rune (worth 250 gp). A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the rune is a symbol of evocation, though the amulet is nonmagical.

Vevette's chest has three [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md).

Agorn's chest contains a bundle of love letters from someone named Tamzyn. Hidden in one of the envelopes is an elegant platinum necklace (worth 250 gp), featuring a tiny cameo containing a sketched portrait of a beautiful Turami woman.

In Havia's chest is a golden comb shaped like a stylized dragon with tiny rubies for eyes (worth 250 gp).

Mookie's chest contains a tiny halfling doll. Stuffed inside the doll is a pouch that holds five 100 gp pearls.

#### E12. Manshoon's Quarters

![Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/img/manshoon.webp#center)

No one aside from [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) is allowed down here. The alabaster stairs that lead to this room descend 10 feet farther to E13.

This room contains the following features:

- Across from the stairs stands a large bed with purple sheets. Sitting on the edge of the bed is a handsome young male human in elegant robes. Long black hair partially conceals his angelic face as he attaches a metal appendage to the withered stump of his left arm.  
- The only other piece of furniture is a table with legs carved to resemble winged serpents. Displayed on the table is a metal mask with an intimidating, tyrannical visage.  

The handsome young figure is [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) (see appendix B), who is much older than he looks.

This version of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) isn't spoiling for a fight. He commends the characters for making it this far and shows no concern for the Zhents they defeated to reach him, since he considers all his followers expendable.

The characters' best chance of survival is to convince [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) that they can be cowed or bribed into working for him. Weary of his conflict with the Xanathar Guild, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) suggests that the characters prove their usefulness to him by hunting down and killing [Xanathar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/xanathar-wdh.md) in its lair (see chapter 5). [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) also demands that they keep his presence in Waterdeep a secret for now, saying that he will reward them for their discretion "when the time comes." In exchange, he allows the characters to return to Waterdeep and promises them positions of power in his organization once [Xanathar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/xanathar-wdh.md)'s death is confirmed. He has no intention of making good on this promise, but refusing to work for him puts the characters in a tight spot, since the evil archwizard can't risk exposure.

If a fight breaks out, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) grabs his [staff of power](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff-of-power.md) (which he hides under the bed) and holds his ground. For more information on how to play [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), see "Facing [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)" at the beginning of this chapter.

##### Tyrant's Mask

The mask on the table is nonmagical, but [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) likes to put it on before meeting with his followers.

#### E13. Manshoon's Study

The alabaster stairs end here. The room contains the following features:

- A plush lavender carpet covers the floor.  
- In one far corner of the room, a low table is set between two purple couches. The table has a thin drawer built into it.  
- In the other far corner, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s spellbook rests atop a black marble lectern protected by an [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [helmed horror](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/helmed-horror.md). The construct attacks anyone other than [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) who disturbs the book (becoming visible as it does so). It obeys [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s commands if he is present, and it fights until destroyed.  

##### Table

The table's drawer has an [arcane lock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell cast on it. The spell can be bypassed by someone who makes a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or with a [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic. The drawer can also be forced open with a successful DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check. Inside is a leather-bound ledger that provides a paper trail implicating [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) in two blackmail schemes. An hour spent studying the ledger uncovers the following information:

- Corylus Thann, a racist Waterdavian noble, is paying the Zhentarim not to reveal that he hired Zhent thugs to assault non-humans.  
- Jelenn Urmbrusk, a Waterdavian noble, receives regular payments from the Zhentarim to offset monies he loses in bad investments.  

The ledger doesn't reveal that Corylus Thann and Jelenn Urmbrusk are Masked Lords, or that [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s blackmail of them also forces them to use their influence to cover up or dismiss crimes perpetrated by [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s forces in Waterdeep. If the authorities obtain the ledger, they round up anyone suspected of having ties to [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) or the Zhentarim, which disrupts the wizard's operation (see "Disrupting [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s Operation"). Surprisingly, neither Corylus nor Jelenn is arrested or even questioned.

Slipped into the ledger is a piece of paper with a list of names in [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s handwriting. [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) keeps this list of Masked Lords whose identities he knows, with check marks indicating the ones he's blackmailing:

> [!note] 
> 
> - [Mirt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mirt-wdh.md)  
> - Corylus Thann √  
> - Thardouk Starbuckler  
> - Jelenn Urmbrusk √  
> - Dorgar Adarbrent  
^432

##### Manshoon's Spellbook

This spellbook weighs 20 pounds and is covered in beholder hide. It contains all the spells [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) has prepared (see appendix B) plus the following spells: [alarm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alarm.md), [alter self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alter-self.md), [animate dead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animate-dead.md), [antimagic field](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field.md), [arcane lock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md), [blight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blight.md), [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [dominate monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster.md), [dream](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dream.md), [etherealness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/etherealness.md), [Evard's black tentacles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/evards-black-tentacles.md), [feather fall](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/feather-fall.md), [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md), [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md), [gaseous form](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [geas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/geas.md), [gentle repose](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gentle-repose.md), [glyph of warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md), [hold monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster.md), [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md), [mass suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mass-suggestion.md), [phantom steed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantom-steed.md), [protection from evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md), [scrying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md), [symbol](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/symbol.md), [telekinesis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md), [teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md), [teleportation circle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleportation-circle.md), [Tenser's floating disk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tensers-floating-disk.md), [tongues](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md), [vampiric touch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/vampiric-touch.md), [wall of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md), and [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md). Stealing or destroying this spellbook disrupts [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s operation (see "Disrupting [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s Operation"), since he must devote time and resources to retrieving or replacing it.

If [Laeral Silverhand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/laeral-silverhand-wdh.md) has the opportunity to trade for [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s spellbook, she offers the characters a [sailing ship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sailing-ship.md) and a set of [bracers of archery](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bracers-of-archery.md) for it. [Vajra Safahr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vajra-safahr-wdh.md) offers the characters membership in Force Grey, a [cape of the mountebank](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cape-of-the-mountebank.md), and a [wand of lightning bolts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-lightning-bolts.md) for the book.

##### Stone of Golorr

If [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) has the [Stone of Golorr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/stone-of-golorr-wdh.md), he keeps it in the drawer of the table along with his ledger.

## Special Events

You can use one or more of the following special events before or after the characters explore Kolat Towers and [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s extradimensional sanctum.

### Blackmailed Lords

The events described in this section might occur if the characters obtain the ledger from E13 and use the information in it to confront either Corylus Thann or Jelenn Urmbrusk about their suspicious dealings with [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md). The Thann and Umbrusk families have walled estates in the Sea Ward.

#### Corylus Thann

The Thanns are Waterdeep's most prominent vintners and have deep roots in the city. Corylus (LE male Tethyrian human [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) is happy to let other members of his family manage the wine business while he focuses on his duties as a Masked Lord. Unfortunately, he lacks the principles and sound judgment that have led to House Thann's success in the past. He also places the welfare of humans above non-humans. In the past, he has used Zhentarim thugs to inflict harm on non-humans who sought positions of political power in the city. Now the Zhents are blackmailing Corylus, threatening to expose his bigotry unless he uses his influence as a Masked Lord to cover up their illegal activities.

The characters are most likely to encounter Corylus as he travels through the city by coach, accompanied by six human [guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) who watch his back and keep the rabble at bay. Corylus refuses to speak with the party. If the characters become an annoyance, he has eight crooked members of the City Watch (human [veterans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) crack down on them, then uses his position as Masked Lord to clear any charges leveled against these Watch members. Corylus refuses to be indebted to anyone, so any attempt by the characters to curry favor with him is met with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Even if they dispose of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), Corylus refuses to acknowledge that he owes them anything.

#### Jelenn Urmbrusk

Jelenn (N female Tethyrian human [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) is a proud woman in her fifties who desperately wants to get out of debt. Several bad investments ruined her money-lending business, and most of her reliable customers have turned to other providers such as the Cassalanters. Jelenn could have borrowed money from any of a number of nobles in the city or sold off some of the property her family owns in Waterdeep, but doing so would have turned her private financial woes into local gossip. Fear of that exposure led her to borrow money from the Zhentarim instead—a decision she has come to regret. The Zhents working for [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) promise to keep their relationship secret on the condition that she do everything in her power to further the group's welfare in Waterdeep.

When not dealing with her slimy creditors, Jelenn is occupied with Masked Lord business. She has no time for a face-to-face meeting with anyone she doesn't know. Characters can confront her as she comes or goes to and from her villa, but she never travels without sixteen [guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) who form a protective wall around her. If the characters brazenly mention [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) or the Zhentarim by name to her, Jelenn demands that they leave her alone or face dire consequences. Jelenn's threat is mostly bluster, since she's not eager to make enemies.

If the characters free Jelenn from the yoke of the Black Network by defeating [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), her debt is effectively canceled. In her delight, she grants them a special favor (see "Special Favors" in chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). On the other hand, if they threaten to go to the press with [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md)'s ledger in an attempt to blackmail or discredit her, she pretends to go along with them while secretly using her influence as a Masked Lord to make their lives difficult.

### Deadwinter Day Feast

The Fellowship of Innkeepers—in conjunction with the Bakers' Guild, the Guild of Butchers, and the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild—decides to hold a Deadwinter Day feast for the residents of Trollskull Alley. Broxley Fairkettle (see "Sample Guild Representatives"), asks the characters if they would be willing to host the feast in their tavern. He believes the gesture would be appreciated by their neighbors, in light of the recent deaths in the area (see chapter 3).

If the characters offer up their tavern for the feast, guild representatives arrive to stock and decorate it for the event. During the three days before the holiday, the tavern is bustling with activity and excitement. Hundreds show up on the day of the feast to partake—not only residents of Trollskull Alley, but also folk from neighboring streets. There's plenty of food to go around, but the tavern practically groans under the weight of the crowd, and additional tables are set up outside to handle the overflow. People don't appear to mind, even as heavy snow begins to fall. Members of the City Watch are on hand to make sure everyone behaves.

Nothing violent happens during the Deadwinter Day feast, but the tavern suffers damage as a result of the crowds. The Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild offers to make repairs for free, but the characters must close the establishment for a tenday to facilitate the work. The closure has no effect on business in the long term, however, since the feast fosters such goodwill that clients return in force when the tavern reopens.

The feast is a great opportunity for characters to hobnob with neighbors, guild members, and City Watch constables, as well as to gather information on local happenings.

### Secret Simulacrum

If the characters make an enemy of [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md), he tries to capture one of them and replace that character with a magical duplicate created using the [simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/simulacrum.md) spell. If one of the players is absent for a game session and circumstances allow it, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) targets that character for replacement while the rest of the party is distracted by other matters. You don't need to roleplay the character's capture; just assume it happens. To create a simulacrum of the character, [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) needs some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of the character's body. Once he obtains the necessary components from the captured character, he creates the simulacrum and sends it to the party with instructions to spy on the group and undermine it from within.

If [Manshoon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/manshoon-wdh.md) embeds a simulacrum within the party, talk privately to the player whose character has been replaced. Then have that player run the simulacrum until it is destroyed or the character it replaced is reintroduced. The simulacrum has the same statistics as the character, but it has only half the character's hit point maximum and can't gain levels.

# Chapter 1: Dragon's Rest
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, p. 6* 

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/002-01-001-splash-art.webp#center)

The adventure begins at a tiny cloister called Dragon's Rest, a haven where world-weary people come to seek peace, reconciliation, and enlightenment. There, the characters learn about the dangers facing Stormwreck Isle.

Each character has a specific reason for coming to the cloister, as shown on the character sheets. You can also let players invent their own reasons for their characters to seek out [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s wisdom and assistance.

## Welcome to Dragon's Rest

Read the following text when you're ready to start:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Your journey was uneventful, but the island now visible off the bow promises rare wonders. Seaweed shimmers in countless brilliant colors below you, and rays of sunlight defy the overcast sky to illuminate the lush grass and dark basalt rock of the island. Avoiding the rocks jutting up from the ocean, your ship makes its way toward a calm harbor on the island's north side.
> 
> A large, open-air temple comes into view, perched on the edge of a cliff high above you. The ship drops anchor at the mouth of the harbor, and two sailors row you ashore. You have plenty of time to admire the towering statue at the center of the temple, depicting a wizened man surrounded by seven songbirds. A long path winds up the side of the cliff to the temple, dotted along the way with doorways cut into the rock.
> 
> The sailors set you ashore on a rickety dock, where a large rowboat is neatly tied. They point to the base of the path and wish you good luck before they row back to the ship. Your visit to Dragon's Rest begins!
^013

Before continuing with the adventure, encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already. They might want to discuss their reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest, or they might prefer to keep their reasons secret for now. If they have any questions about what they can see of the cloister from the boat, use map 2 and the information in "Dragon's Rest Locations" to answer them.

Ask the players to give you the party's marching order as they start toward the cloister. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? Make a note of this marching order.

When you're ready, continue with the "Drowned Sailors" section.

### Drowned Sailors

Read the following text to start the encounter:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you're about to leave the beach and start your climb, you hear a ruckus of splashing and a wet, gurgling moan behind you. Three figures are shambling up from the water's edge, about thirty feet away. They're dressed as sailors, but their skin is gray and they look drowned. Sea water drools from their slack mouths as they lurch toward you.
^015

The three shambling sailors are [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), the animated corpses of sailors who died in a recent shipwreck. The characters face a choice: they can turn and fight the zombies, or they can continue up the path and leave the slow, shambling zombies behind.

If the characters turn and fight, this is the first combat encounter in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it:

- Review the [zombie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) stat block.  
- Use the "initiative" rules to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count on your notepad.  
- On the zombies' initiative count, they move toward the characters. If they get close enough, they make melee attacks. The zombies' stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. If all the characters are more than 20 feet away, the zombies use the [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action so they can move farther. For more information on what the zombies can do on their turn, see ""Combat"" in the "Basic Rules".  
- The zombies fight until they're all defeated.  

#### Tip: Undead Fortitude

The zombies' Undead Fortitude trait reflects how hard it is to kill these walking corpses. When this trait prevents a zombie from dying, give the players a hint about what happened. You might say, "That should have finished the creature off, but it refuses to stop moving!" On the flip side, any time a zombie takes radiant damage (such as from the cleric's [sacred flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sacred-flame.md) cantrip), you might describe the creature howling in agony. This can help the players realize that radiant damage is a way to get around Undead Fortitude. If the players ask whether their characters know anything about fighting zombies, have them make DC 10 Intelligence checks. Those who succeed might recall that a particularly powerful blow (a "critical hit") or radiant damage can help finish off a zombie.

#### Runara's Aid

In the unlikely event that the zombies defeat the adventurers, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) comes to their rescue. The characters wake up in the temple (area A5 in Dragon's Rest). [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) explains that she heard the sounds of combat and arrived just in time to prevent the zombies from dragging the characters into the sea.

#### Avoiding the Zombies

If the characters decide not to fight the zombies, they easily escape from the slow, shambling monsters. The zombies don't follow them up the path toward Dragon's Rest. The characters will have another opportunity to deal with the zombies later (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter).

### Meeting the Inhabitants

Read this text when the characters first climb the path to Dragon's Rest:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Your arrival quickly draws the attention of the entire population of the place—which consists mostly of kobolds. These small, reptilian folk eye you curiously while a couple of humans watch from a distance. All the cloister's residents are dressed in simple clothes, and no one carries a visible weapon. One of the kobolds pipes up with, "What's your name?"
> 
> At that, all the kobolds begin barraging you with questions—"Where are you from?" "What's that?" "Why are you here?" and more that are lost in the din.
^01b

Visitors to the cloister are rare, and the kobolds' curiosity is insatiable; they keep asking questions until the characters insist they stop.

When the characters quiet the kobolds (or if the players start showing signs of exasperation), the leader of the cloister approaches to welcome the characters. Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The chattering kobolds fall silent as a new figure comes into view, descending gracefully from the upper part of the cloister. She's an elderly human woman with weathered brown skin, white hair in tight braids, and kindly hazel eyes, dressed in a simple white robe. She smiles as she draws near and extends her arms in greeting.
> 
> "Welcome to Dragon's Rest," she says. "May Bahamut's guidance lead you to whatever you seek."
^01c

This is Elder [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md), the leader of Dragon's Rest. If the characters defeated the zombies at the beach, she thanks them for their service to the cloister. Even if they did not fight the zombies, she tells them they're welcome to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish, sleeping either in one of the monastic cells (area A1) or in the temple (area A5) and eating with the rest of the community in the dining room (area A3). [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) says nothing about payment of any kind. If the characters offer to give money or perform services around the cloister in exchange for her hospitality, she accepts these gifts.

Throughout this adventure, Dragon's Rest serves as a home base for the characters. All the places they'll explore on the island are within a few miles of the cloister, and they can return here whenever they wish to rest, heal, and get information they need for the next part of their adventures. In addition, they can buy any of the "equipment" described in the "Basic Rules" from [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md) (see "Kobolds").

During their time at Dragon's Rest, the characters can interact with any of its residents. All the residents but [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) live in the small monastic cells cut into the cliff face (area A1 on the cloister map).

#### Elder Runara

Elder [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) is the leader of Dragon's Rest. She appears as a human woman, but she is actually an adult bronze dragon disguised in human form. She guides the residents of the cloister in their contemplation and study. The cloister's inhabitants know [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s true identity, but they do not speak of it to visitors.

[Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s initial attitude toward the characters is indifferent (see ""Social Interaction"" in the "Basic Rules"). She becomes friendly as soon as the characters demonstrate that they care about the cloister's safety, such as by fighting the zombies at the beach or undertaking any of the quests she offers them (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). If the characters harm any of the residents of Dragon's Rest, she becomes hostile and insists the characters make amends for the harm they did before she is willing to deal with them in any way.

[Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s mission is to help those whose lives have been shaped by violence find new paths forward in peace. Ultimately, she would like to see chromatic and metallic dragons find a peaceful way to coexist in the world. In the meantime, she finds comfort in helping humans and other people escape from cycles of violence.

[Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) maintains a secret lair in a cave accessed by an undersea tunnel, a short distance from the cloister and not shown on the map of Dragon's Rest. She is careful not to enter or leave the cave when anyone might spot her, and she enters and emerges from the water in the open ocean, out of sight of the cloister. The other residents of the cloister think she lives in the temple at the top of the island (area A5), or they simply laugh away queries about her accommodations, explaining that she's always in the temple, or in the library, or checking on the rest of the residents—she never seems to sleep!

#### Kobolds

Kobolds are small reptilian Humanoids who believe they are descended from dragons and often live near them. Over the centuries, many bands of kobolds have been drawn to Stormwreck Isle by the lingering draconic magic that suffuses the island. Nine kobolds utterly devoted to [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) now live at Dragon's Rest.

![Ever since an unfortunate ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/003-01-002-kobold-laylee.webp#center "Ever since an unfortunate incident in the kitchen, Laylee is no longer allowed to handle Myla's alchemical fire.")

The kobolds of Dragon's Rest are lawful good, sharing [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s ideals of justice and compassion. Since they are sensitive to sunlight, they work at night and avoid moving about during the day. Unless otherwise noted, the kobolds are initially friendly toward the adventurers.

The kobolds are summarized below. They can offer a local perspective or be a way for you to pass hints to the players if they're having trouble putting things together. But don't feel like you need to bring all nine of these kobolds to life! Pick one or two of these kobolds that you and the characters like the most and let them be the focus of the characters' interactions with the kobolds:

**Agga** speaks little and has no patience for nonsense. She keeps the rest of the kobolds organized and in line. She is indifferent toward visitors, but if the characters show respect for the cloister and help keep the more rambunctious kobolds in line, her attitude improves to friendly.

**Blepp** has a sharp danger sense and is convinced he's supernaturally lucky. His prized possession is an ordinary dagger he claims is magical.

**Frub** has limitless energy and desperately needs help finding productive directions to channel it. He loves to ask questions about everything other people are doing.

**Kilnip** has terrible insomnia and sleeps only a few hours each day. She is always tired but an eager conversationalist.

**Laylee** has a curious mind and a talent for tools and building. She serves as [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md)'s helper.

**Mumpo** is so audaciously courageous that he stole a copper piece from [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s hoard. He's convinced she has no idea. (He is wrong, but [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) finds the situation amusing and lets Mumpo continue to believe in her ignorance.)

**Myla** (lawful good [kobold tinkerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold-tinkerer-dosi.md) ) is a winged kobold whose brothers, Mek and Minn, now follow Sparkrender, the [blue wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md) in Clifftop Observatory (see chapter 4). When [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md)'s wings were badly injured in an attack by [stirges](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) (which she describes as "hungry, icky, blood-sucking, bat-things"), [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) helped in her recovery. Now [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md) spends her time experimenting with alchemy, engineering, and magic.

**Rix** is pious and tends to the temple, acting as [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s assistant. She adores puns. Rix recently witnessed a ship crashing on the rocks to the north (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter).

**Zark** is rude and fond of colorful insults. His favorites are "Eat my sword, bugbear breath!" and "Your father was a gas spore!" He is indifferent toward visitors.

#### Tarak

[Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) is a human in late middle age. He has pale skin tanned darker with many freckles, auburn hair and a beard that is mostly gray, and gray-blue eyes. Faded tattoos in an abstract design peek up the side of his neck from beneath his dirt-stained robes.

An avid botanist, [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) tends the cloister's garden plots, growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables. He is soft spoken and helpful, eager to share his knowledge of herbalism. But his kindly demeanor belies his past as a ruthless poisoner for a thieves' guild. After his work led to the death of his lover, he fled the guild and plans to spend the rest of his life atoning for his past evils.

[Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) is initially friendly toward visitors, but if a character pries into his past, his attitude shifts—first to indifferent, then to hostile if the character continues to push. When he's hostile, his demeanor becomes cold and clipped, and he avoids the characters if he can.

A gold hangman's noose is worked into the design of [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md)'s visible tattoos. A character who studies the tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes the mark as a symbol associated with the Gilded Gallows, a thieves' guild that operates in a country far to the southeast called Elturgard. A character with the [criminal background](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/criminal-spy-variant.md) automatically succeeds on this check. [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) does not willingly discuss the details of his past with anyone but trusted friends.

[Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) frequently visits the sea caves on the south side of the island to acquire heart cap mushrooms from the myconids that live there. He uses the mushrooms to make [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md). But the myconids have installed a fearsome guardian at their caves—a fungus-covered octopus monster—that has turned him away on his latest visits, and he is worried (see "Cloister Quests").

#### Varnoth

[Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) is a muscular human whose black hair is cropped close to her scalp. Her light brown skin bears many scars—one of which runs across her left eye, which is milky and blind. An elegant prosthetic made from wood and metal replaces her right leg below the knee.

[Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) was a feared general at the head of a mercenary company called the Azure Wolves. Age and battle have taken a toll on her, and she is spending her twilight years in reflective contemplation at Dragon's Rest. Her demeanor is gruff, but she is observant and empathetic. Above all, [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) believes in second chances and redemption.

[Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) has a set of mason's tools that she uses to maintain the temple and other areas of the cloister. While working in the temple recently, she witnessed a ship change course and crash into the rocks to the north (see "Cloister Quests").

[Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) is indifferent to visitors, but a character can shift her attitude to friendly by engaging her in conversation on her favorite topics: history, ethics, and the impact of individual actions on the world.

A character who learns [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md)'s name and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check recalls hearing of General [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) Wender and the Azure Wolves, which was a mighty force in the east about a decade ago. A character with the [soldier background](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/soldier.md) succeeds on this check automatically.

### Dragon's Rest Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2, which shows the layout of Dragon's Rest.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2: Dragons Rest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/004-map-1-01-dragons-rest.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/005-map-1-01-dragons-rest-player.webp#gallery)

#### A1: Path and Monastic Cells

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long path leads from the rocky shore up the side of the cliff, with occasional stairs to ease the ascent. Here and there along the lower part of the path, well-tended garden plots hold flowers, herbs, and vegetables.
> 
> About thirty feet above the bay, the path widens into a long plaza. Halfway along the plaza, a stone statue of a dragon gazes serenely down the path. Six open doorways are cut into the cliff side.
^023

##### Statue

The star-in-a-circle symbol on the map represents the dragon statue. A character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes that it depicts a bronze dragon—a member of the metallic family. If characters ask [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) about the statue, she tells them it depicts Astalagan, who died on these cliffs centuries ago. She doesn't tell them that Astalagan was her father.

##### Cells

The doorways lead into simple monastic cells occupied by the cloister residents. Each cell is furnished with a bed, a nightstand, a small desk, and a chair.

The westernmost cell is vacant, and it is available to the characters if they don't mind sharing the space. Next to it is [Tarak's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) cell, then [Varnoth's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md). The fourth cell is [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md)'s, cluttered with junk and tools. The fifth and sixth cells are strung with hammocks, offering space for the other eight kobolds to sleep.

#### A2: Winch House

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A small, free-standing building halfway up the path has a peaked roof and a weathered wooden door. A sturdy wooden pallet wrapped with rope hangs beneath the building on an iron chain, lying flat against the cliff face.
^027

Inside the building is a winch that allows the pallet to be lowered down to the water, 50 feet below. When boats deliver supplies to the cloister, the residents use this pallet to haul goods both up and down.

A lever locks the winch in place. If a character pulls the lever, the pallet falls down to the water and floats there. As an action, a character can operate the winch to pull the pallet back up 10 feet.

#### A3: Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A doorway in the rock opens into a dining room with a long table. Two benches run the length of the table, and a single chair sits at the table's head. A short hallway connects to a small, tidy kitchen.
^029

The cloister residents share three daily meals here. They take turns cooking and cleaning up after meals. Nobody says it out loud, but the days when [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) cooks are everyone's favorite.

#### A4: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Of all the doorways cut into the cliff face, only one has an actual door. This entry's door is made of sturdy oak with iron bands, and it swings open easily to reveal a spacious library. Bookshelves line every wall, with three free-standing shelves in the west half of the room. In the east half is a table with two benches, writing implements, book stands, and glass-shielded lamps.
^02b

The cloister library holds books and scrolls covering a variety of topics, but focused on theology and history. [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) spends nearly half her time in here, studying, copying, and annotating the library's collection. [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) and [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) also come here to read and discuss various works. Many of the kobolds visit as well, but mostly for the quiet; only [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md) could be described as studious.

#### A5: Temple of Bahamut

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The highest point of the cloister is crowned by an open-air temple that overhangs the cliff, supported by arched stone struts anchored to the cliff face. The north wall of the temple is carved directly into the rock, while the rest is open to the sea air. Heavy pillars mark the three open sides, supporting the wooden roof. In the center of the temple stands a stone statue of a kind-looking old man with canaries perched on his hands, shoulders, and head. A feeling of serenity suffuses the place.
^02d

The temple is very simple, with the statue (represented by the star-in-a-circle symbol on the map) as its only furnishing. The statue depicts Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, in mortal disguise, surrounded by seven canaries that represent gold dragons who accompany him on his travels. A character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes Bahamut, and any resident of Dragon's Rest identifies the god if asked.

Depressions in the statue's pedestal at the four cardinal directions hold offerings of incense made to Bahamut. [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) spends about half her time here, tending and maintaining the temple, offering prayers and incense, or in quiet contemplation. Other residents of the cloister help her, most often [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) and the kobold Rix.

The feeling of serenity that pervades the temple is the result of protective magic. A non-evil creature who makes a "saving throw" within the temple can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the saving throw. If a character casts [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) in the temple, the spell reveals a faint aura around the statue. [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) is the only inhabitant of Dragon's Rest who knows that this is a lingering effect of the death of a dragon on this site—her father, Astalagan.

##### About Bahamut

Known as the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the patron and progenitor of metallic dragons. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. He seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and the evil dragons that serve her.

## Cloister Quests

As the characters explore Dragon's Rest, the residents talk with them about the problems the cloister is facing. These conversations are opportunities for you to introduce the players to the adventures that await them in the sea caves, the shipwreck, and the ancient observatory.

This adventure is designed to be flexible and give the players the sense that they're in charge of their destiny on Stormwreck Isle. Ideally, the characters will spend time at Dragon's Rest and then explore both Seagrow Caves (described in chapter 2) and the wreck of *Compass Rose* (chapter 3). They can choose where to go first. After they've explored both of those sites, they should be ready to face Sparkrender in the Clifftop Observatory (chapter 4).

Each character sheet includes a personal goal for that character. Some of those goals are concrete—the wizard, for example, is eager to learn the secrets of Clifftop Observatory. Others are more general and might be fulfilled gradually over the course of the adventure—both the paladin and the fighter gaining a better understanding of their role in the world, for example. Use those goals (described under "Individual Quests" below) to help the players bring their characters to life as they interact with [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) and the other residents of Dragon's Rest.

### Zombie Resurgence

If the adventurers did not fight the zombies when they first arrived on the island, the zombies cause trouble later. After the characters have spent some time at the cloister, they hear cries for help. Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two residents of Dragon's Rest are running for their lives up the lower path, their fishing equipment discarded behind them. Blood and dirt stain their robes. Three figures shamble after them—bloated corpses dressed as sailors, moaning and gurgling.
^031

The characters have another opportunity to fight the three [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), this time with the lives of two new acquaintances—Blepp the [kobold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) and [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) the human gardener—hanging in the balance. See "Drowned Sailors" for help getting the encounter started.

Blepp has 2 hit points left after a zombie hit him, and he is convinced that his good luck and his "magical" dagger saved him from certain death. [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) is unarmed, and the zombies overpower both him and Blepp if the characters don't help.

If the characters talk to [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) about the zombies, she tells them she suspects a wrecked ship off the rocks to the north is the source of these monsters, and she asks the characters to investigate the site (see "Shipwreck" below).

#### More Zombies

If the characters defeated the zombies when they first arrived on the island, you can use this encounter at any point during the adventure to add a little extra combat spice to the characters' lives. If the characters have already reached 2nd level, you can use from four to six [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) to give them a good challenge.

### Sea Caves

[Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) is eager to reestablish contact with the myconids of the sea caves. He asks the characters to visit the caves, find out what's wrong with the myconids, and bring him back some heart cap mushrooms. He warns them about the fungal octopus the myconids have created as a guardian and tells them they'll probably have to fight the creature to gain access to the caves. He also gives them a foul-smelling sack of food scraps they can give the myconids as a gesture of friendship. Finally, he gives them two [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md).

### Shipwreck

Several ships have recently crashed on the rocks north of Dragon's Rest and sunk with no survivors, and a few days ago both [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md) and the kobold Rix witnessed the most recent wreck. They saw the ship abruptly veer off course and crash into the rocks, and they suggest the characters might help the island by discovering what caused the crash. If the characters ask [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) about it, she suggests that the answer is likely to be found on an older wreck—the wreck of *Compass Rose*.

### Individual Quests

As described on the character sheets, the characters have their own reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest.

#### The Cleric

The cleric was led here by a recurring dream involving the shadow of death. If the character talks to [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) about the dream or their quest, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) listens closely, then pauses to think. "Well," she says, "I am no expert on interpreting dreams, but perhaps the zombies you fought are the 'hunger of death' you spoke of." She points the character toward the wreck of *Compass Rose* (see "Shipwreck" above) to investigate further.

#### The Fighter

The fighter has come to Dragon's Rest in the hope that [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) can help the character understand the sense of destiny that weighs on their shoulders. If the character talks to [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) about this on first arriving at the cloister, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) invites the character to consider how their reaction to the zombies on the beach might reflect their destiny—or not. If the character talks to [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) after having completed one or more of the adventure's quests, she encourages the character to consider whether their heroic actions might be the first manifestations of that destiny taking shape. At the end of the adventure, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) encourages the character to continue on their path: "If your destiny is not clear to you yet, I'm confident it soon will be."

#### The Paladin

Disillusioned with the corruption of Neverwinter, the paladin comes to Dragon's Rest seeking rest and new resolve. [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) welcomes the character and encourages them to talk to [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) and [Varnoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/varnoth-dosi.md), who both know about escaping lives of corruption and violence. She also encourages the paladin to spend time in the temple of Bahamut. At the end of the adventure, she asks the paladin if they have learned anything about how to live in a world plagued with such corruption. If the character has no answer, she suggests, "Perhaps your adventures here have shown you a way to combat evil on your own terms. Perhaps other such adventures await you."

#### The Rogue

The rogue comes to Dragon's Rest in search of a lost fortune supposedly secreted away on the island by a member of the Gilded Gallows. The thieves' guild member in question is [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md), who did in fact betray the guild, though the story has been twisted in the retelling. [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md)'s last assignment for the guild was to assassinate a traitor, who was his lover. The two tried to flee Elturgard together, but his lover was killed by another assassin. [Tarak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tarak-dosi.md) escaped, but no treasure was involved. If the rogue asks him about it, he explains he has left the life of crime—and suggests perhaps it's time for the rogue to do the same.

#### The Wizard

The wizard carries a letter from a colleague about lost knowledge held in the Clifftop Observatory (see chapter 4). If asked about the observatory, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) says, "Many have sought the knowledge contained in that place. I can direct you there, but first you need to show me you are worthy." She promises to direct the wizard to the observatory after the characters help deal with the other problems on the island.

### Lost Wyrmling

When the characters have proven themselves trustworthy and competent by dealing with the zombies, the myconids, and the shipwreck, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) decides it's time to confide in them. She summons them to the temple (area A5). Read the following text when the characters arrive:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Elder [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) smiles as you approach. "I have something to show you," she says. There's a flash like a silent stroke of lightning, and the human woman is gone. In her place is an enormous dragon with bronze-colored scales. "Now you see me as I truly am," she says, tilting her head with an expression that might be a smile on her scaled face.
> 
> "As you have discovered, this island has many old wounds. And I'm afraid the cycle of violence is starting again. I have one more favor to ask you."
^03c

[Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) outlines the history summarized in the "Adventure Background" section and explains that each site the characters visited is linked to the death of a dragon. Then she tells them that a bronze wyrmling named Aidron came to the island a few months ago and studied with her at Dragon's Rest. Five days before the characters' arrival, he argued with her, angrily rejected her teaching of peace, and stormed away from the cloister. She fears he went to the ancient observatory on the southeast side of the island, which is another dragon's final resting place. She suspects some evil has arisen there, but says she dares not go there herself, lest her presence reopen old wounds. She gives them a moonstone key—a 3-inch-long, 1-inch-wide hexagonal prism made from moonstone, with a dragon's head engraved on one end—and explains that they'll need it to access the observatory.

> [!note] Runara Saves the Day!
> 
> [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) is a powerful dragon, but she is dedicated to the cause of peace. She's not interested in fighting the battles that the characters might get themselves into, but she keeps an eye on them, and she can rescue them if things go badly for them on the island.
> 
> If any encounter on the island ends with all the characters [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious), you can have the characters awaken in the temple (area A5), with some of the kobolds tending to their wounds. [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) prefers not to explain how she rescued the characters.
> 
> If this happens more than once, the characters might need extra assistance. If you haven't already, consider asking one or more players to play an additional character as a sidekick. You can explain that these additional characters have just arrived at Dragon's Rest and are eager to help.

## Exploring the Island

This adventure presents Dragon's Rest and three adventure locations in detail, but Stormwreck Isle holds the possibility of excitement and danger beyond those sites. While the characters travel between locations on the island, or if they set out to explore the island, they might stumble across fantastical creatures and locations that provide an extra challenge on their journey.

### Additional Encounters

Place these encounters wherever you want to on the island, or use them as inspiration as you begin to craft your own adventures.

#### Hot Springs Havoc

This encounter poses a simple challenge for characters of 2nd level or higher, or a harder challenge for 1st-level characters. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are rowing around the island or making their way along the coast at sea level.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Billowing clouds of steam emerge from the rocks ahead, and the air grows thicker with moisture. As you round a bend, you see a cove where a hot spring burbles up from the rocks and spills into a pool before draining into the ocean. The turquoise water is luminescent, and the gray basalt edges of the spring are lined with vibrantly colored mushrooms, which occasionally burst in a shower of rainbow spores.
^041

Not immediately visible to the characters are the guardians of the spring: three [fume drakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fume-drake-dosi.md). These mischievous creatures are initially indifferent to the characters and ignore their arrival, but if anyone attempts to gather mushrooms or enter the water of the hot spring, the fume drakes become hostile, emerging from the water to attack the group. A character who examines the water and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots the shimmering outlines of the fume drakes in the water.

##### Spring Waters

The spring is the site of a brass dragon's death, and life-giving magic persists at the site. A character who spends 10 minutes bathing in the waters of the spring can roll one of their Hit Dice (noted on each character sheet) and regain hit points equal to the roll plus their Constitution modifier. A character can benefit from bathing in the hot spring at most once per day.

##### Treasure

A character who examines the mushrooms lining the spring and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check identifies these mushrooms as wind spores—a rare fungus with a unique magical property. When a creature squeezes a wind spore mushroom's cap, it releases a small cloud of spores. For 1 hour, the creature doesn't need to breathe, as the spores provide it with oxygen. A wind spore is worth 30 gp, and at any given time `2d4` wind spores are ready to be harvested.

#### There, There, Owlbear

This encounter poses a medium challenge for 3rd-level characters and a difficult challenge for 2nd-level characters. Use it if your group enjoys combat or the players need a chance to practice using their characters' new abilities after gaining a level. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are traveling across the island rather than following the coast.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A discordant sound—half a low growl, half a piercing screech—rips through the air. Abruptly, a hulking creature comes into view. A mix of purple feathers and deep brown fur covers its bearlike body, and its large eyes stare hungrily at you from its owlish head.
^045

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/006-01-003-owlbear.webp#center)

This [owlbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) is hostile toward the characters. It views them as intruders in its territory, though its goal is to drive them away rather than kill them. Originally a part of a performing troupe, the owlbear was stranded here after the ship carrying the troupe crashed on the northern rocks.

Any character within 5 feet of the owlbear notices a small wooden whistle hanging around its neck. This whistle was (and still can be) used to train and command the owlbear. A character within 5 feet of the owlbear can use their action to attempt to grab the whistle. If the character succeeds on a DC 12 Strength check, the whistle comes free. With the whistle in hand, a character can take an action to blow into it and make a DC 10 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. On a success, the owlbear calms and immediately becomes friendly toward the whistle holder and indifferent toward the other characters. However, it won't leave the area it now considers its territory, and any attempt to force it to leave makes it hostile again.

#### Kobold Renegades

This encounter is a difficult challenge for 1st-level characters and can be scaled up for 2nd- or 3rd-level characters as noted below. It's appropriate whenever characters are traveling around the island by land.

A group of kobolds tries to ambush the characters. They're hiding in the rocks and light foliage, hoping to get the jump on the adventurers. Make a Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check for the kobolds, rolling once for all of them and using the Dexterity modifier (+2) of the wingless kobolds. Compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the kobolds' check result is "surprised" and loses their turn during the first round of combat (see ""Surprise"" in the "Basic Rules"). Read this text when the kobolds attack:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A yipping sound erupts around you as angry kobolds emerge from their hiding places and attack!
^047

Four [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) and one [winged kobold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/winged-kobold.md) (all lawful evil) participate in this ambush. These cruel, vicious kobolds reject both the peaceful teaching of [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) and the tyrannical rule of Sparkrender, and they prey on travelers who stray away from Dragon's Rest. They haven't had much success and are desperate, so they're hostile and fight to the death.

Their desperation means that they can easily be persuaded to stop fighting with an offer of money or food. Otherwise, they're not interested in conversation or negotiation.

##### 2nd-Level Characters

If the characters are 2nd level, use six kobolds and two winged kobolds.

##### 3rd-Level Characters

If the characters are 3rd level, use eight kobolds and three winged kobolds.

#### What Lies Beneath

As described in the "Adventure Background" section in the introduction, Stormwreck Isle was formed from magic-fueled volcanic activity in the tomb of a monstrous red dragon named Sharruth. Some legends and rumors suggest Sharruth is not actually dead, merely imprisoned beneath the island, and the activity in Seagrow Caves suggests that all is not well beneath Stormwreck Isle.

You can devise your own adventures around characters investigating Sharruth's tomb. Characters might scour the island until they find hidden vents they can use to access winding tunnels leading deep into the earth. More fume drakes and fire snakes might lurk below. Perhaps there's even a group of kobolds who serve mighty Sharruth.

Such an adventure is yours to devise, and you can put your unique spin on what the characters do and discover there. Of course, if you're not ready to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the island, then the characters simply don't discover those subterranean passages no matter how much they search.

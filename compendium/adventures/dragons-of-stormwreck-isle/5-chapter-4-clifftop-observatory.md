# Chapter 4: Clifftop Observatory
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, p. 28* 

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/015-04-001-splash-art.webp#center)

This chapter assumes the characters visit the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves and the wreck of *Compass Rose*, and thus have reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting the other adventure sites, the combat encounters are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) won't give the characters the moonstone key or information about the observatory until after they've dealt with the island's other problems. If necessary, you can have [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) warn the characters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet.

## Observatory Overview

During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gorgeous stained glass windows and marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churning sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was wrecked when [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) battled her blue dragon rival centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled memory overtaken by nature.

In recent months, the observatory ruins have become the home of an arrogant [blue dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md) called Sparkrender, a descendant of [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s ancient rival. Like his ancestor, Sparkrender seeks to claim the destructive magic that lingers at the site. Like [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md), Sparkrender has recruited kobolds to join his cause.

About five days before the characters arrived on the island, a [bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) named Aidron left the safety of Dragon's Rest and [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md)'s tutelage and came to the ancient observatory. The two wyrmlings met and immediately clashed. Sparkrender attempted to turn the bronze wyrmling against [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md), but Aidron's hatred of chromatic dragons was stronger than his disagreement with [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md). Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and imprisoned him in the observatory ruins.

Sparkrender believes Aidron is the key to unlocking the observatory's magic and claiming his ancestor's power. With the bronze wyrmling imprisoned, Sparkrender began planning a ritual that will awaken the spirits of all the island's dead dragons and bind them to his will—at the cost of Aidron's life.

### Observatory Features

The observatory is built on a series of basalt spires jutting up from the ocean at the southeastern tip of Stormwreck Isle. Almost all the structure's former ceilings and walls have crumbled away, exposing the ruins to the open air.

Unless otherwise noted, the ruins stand 30 feet above the ocean's surface. The rugged cliffs offer abundant hand- and footholds, so a character who jumps or falls into the water and survives (see ""Falling"" in the "Basic Rules") can climb back up without needing to make an ability check.

## Running This Chapter

Once the characters decide to visit the Clifftop Observatory, they have three options for reaching the site:

- **By Boat.** Dragon's Rest has a [rowboat](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rowboat.md) the characters can take around the eastern end of the island. The trip to the observatory is 5 miles, which takes about 3 hours and 20 minutes to row.  
- **Along the Coast.** Walking around the coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, and a quicker trip despite the characters having to walk around the eastern bay instead of rowing across it. The 6-mile trip takes only 2 hours at a normal walking pace.  
- **Overland.** The characters can walk southeast from Dragon's Rest to the head of the bay, where a rough path cuts across the island to the eastern bay. The rocky ground of the island is "difficult terrain", but this is still the fastest and most direct route. Characters can make the 3½-mile trip in about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  

### Approaching by Land

If the characters approach the observatory by land, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Clambering over the rocky ground of Stormwreck Isle, you spot strange, twisted protrusions of glassy crystal jutting from the earth. The vegetation in this area bears reddish branching scars that form similar shapes. Suddenly, you hear a screeching roar and notice a winged, glittering blue shape swooping overhead.
^0a6

The blue shape is Sparkrender flying by. This glimpse of the dragon is an opportunity to make your players nervous about the foe they're about to face. Feel free to elaborate on the description of Sparkrender and play on the characters' worry that he might spot them, but ultimately he passes by without noticing them. The characters see him come to rest on a rocky spire off the coast as he returns to his hoard among the ruins (area `D5`).

A character who examines the crystalline protrusions or the scarred vegetation can make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. On a success, the character recognizes the phenomenon as a sign of lightning strikes—or the lightning breath of a blue or bronze dragon.

Assuming the characters continue toward the observatory, they soon arrive at area `D1`, described below.

### Approaching by Water

If the characters row to the observatory, read this text instead:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you round the southeastern tip of the island, you can see crumbling ruins atop basalt columns just off the main island body. If you pull the boat ashore on the island, it would be an easy walk up to the top of the cliffs, though there is no obvious bridge from the cliffs to the ruins. Alternatively, you could tie the boat up at the bottom of the columns and try to climb directly up to the ruins.
> 
> As you consider these options, you hear a screeching roar and notice a winged, glittering blue shape swooping through the air ahead of you. The figure comes to rest atop the column farthest from Stormwreck Isle and vanishes from sight.
^0a8

Again, Sparkrender does not notice the characters as he returns to his lair, but feel free to tease the players with the idea that he *might* notice them.

If the characters beach the boat on the shore, they can easily climb the bluffs to area `D1`, described below. If they tie up the boat at the base of one of the pillars, they can instead climb to the area atop it (area `D2`, `D3`, `D4`, or `D5`).

### Sparkrender's Kobold Allies

The kobolds who joined forces with Sparkrender are lawful evil and cruel. Their initial reaction toward outsiders is hostile (see ""Social Interaction"" in the "Basic Rules"), but they're more likely to warn intruders to leave the ruins than to immediately attack. They readily threaten violence and back up their threats with combat if necessary.

As an action, a character can try to convince a hostile kobold to have a conversation or to allow the characters to explore the area, doing so on a successful DC 15 Charisma check. Depending on the character's approach, the [Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill can apply to the check.

This list summarizes what the kobolds know:

- **Kobold History.** The kobolds here have served Sparkrender for about a year. They revere the blue dragon as a semidivine figure and trust him to provide for their every need.  
- **Big Plans.** Sparkrender has big plans that will allow him to manifest his full power. The wyrmling is waiting for the sculpture in the rotunda ruins (area `D2`) to tell him it's time to act. The kobolds think it must be soon—possibly even today.  
- **Dragon Visitor.** Not long ago, another dragon arrived. This other dragon was about Sparkrender's size but looked like greenish-yellow metal. They remember hearing the two arguing at the observatory tower (area `D5`), and they have heard the other dragon roaring and crashing around inside the tower (area `D6`) since then.  
- **Caved-In Wall.** Though the kobolds have been trying to tidy the ruins, Sparkrender specifically told them not to clean up the newly caved-in wall at the base of the observatory tower (area `D6`). The caved-in wall is visible from area `D3`.  

### Observatory Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5, which shows the layout of the Clifftop Observatory.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5: Clifftop Observatory](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/016-map-4-01-clifftop-observatory.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/dragons-of-stormwreck-isle/img/017-map-4-01-clifftop-observatory-player.webp#gallery)

#### D1: Overlook

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A broken and overgrown path winds to the edge of the cliff. The overlook is marked by two marble statues veined with gold, each carved in the shape of a dragon with its mouth open in a silent roar.
^0ac

At the base of each statue is a small hexagonal indentation, about 1 inch wide and 2 inches deep—perfectly sized to accommodate the moonstone key [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) gave them.

When the key is inserted into the base of either statue, magical light sparks to life in both statues' open mouths, and a shimmering bridge made of iridescent magical energy extends from the overlook to the observatory ruins (area `D2`). The bridge is sturdy and lasts until the key is removed from the statue.

#### D2: Rotunda Ruins

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Broken stone lines this plaza—fragments of elegant statues, once-magnificent pillars, and shining marble walls. At the center, a tall sculpture of rusted planets and gilded stars spins idly in a jerky mimicry of celestial motion.
> 
> A gargled screech suddenly rises from across the plaza. A half-dozen batlike creatures are swarming around two winged kobolds with blue paint smeared across their long snouts. The kobolds are fighting fiercely, but they seem close to being overwhelmed.
^0ae

The two [winged kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/winged-kobold.md) are locked in battle with eight [stirges](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stirge.md). When the characters enter the area, six of the stirges turn their attention to this new, juicier prey. The kobolds try to deal with the remaining two stirges, and then decide what to do based on what the characters are doing. If the characters actively help the kobolds during the battle, then the kobolds return the favor. If the characters attack the kobolds instead of (or as well as) the stirges, the kobolds fight back. Otherwise, the kobolds hang back, trying to stay out of the way until the fight is over.

Once the stirges have been defeated, if the kobolds survive, they approach the characters. Their names are Mek and Minn, and they're the brothers of [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md), the kobold tinkerer at Dragon's Rest. They left their sister for dead after the stirge attack that maimed her wings. They have sworn loyalty to Sparkrender, and they share the dragon's cruel, haughty demeanor.

If the characters actively helped the kobolds or mention that [Myla](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/myla-dosi.md) is alive, the kobolds' attitude becomes friendly. They offer to introduce the characters to their leader and help the characters in any way they can (such as retrieving the moonstone key from area `D1` so the characters can activate the bridge to `D4`). They won't help the characters fight Sparkrender, though; they are loyal to the dragon.

##### Golden Sculpture

The sculpture in the center of the rotunda is an astronomical model used for research in centuries past. The sculpture depicts the planet of Toril (the world of the Forgotten Realms), its moon (called Selûne), the sun, and seven other planets, as well as one comet with a very eccentric orbit. A character who studies the sculpture can puzzle out its importance with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check: its current position suggests the comet will soon pass very close to Toril.

Sparkrender plans to hold his ritual when the comet is at its closest point. He believes the comet, called the King-Killer Star, controls the destiny of dragons and will allow him to claim the power of the dragons who fell on Stormwreck Isle.

##### Dragon Effigies

The stirge attack interrupted the kobolds from their assigned task of preparing this site for Sparkrender's ritual. With the wyrmling's help, they have crudely sculpted five chunks of rubble into vaguely draconic shapes and splashed each one with paint, and the kobolds were in the process of arranging them around the metal sculpture. Each effigy has the name of the dragon it represents etched into it. These are the names and colors of the five dragons:

| Name | Color |
|------|-------|
| Astalagan | Bronze |
| Clyssavar | Gold |
| Eldenemir | Blue |
| Sharruth | Red |
| Turadaer | Brass |
^name-color

If the characters ask the kobolds about these dragon effigies, Mek and Minn swell with pride and explain that they crafted them according to Sparkrender's instructions. The kobolds know the effigies have some part to play in Sparkrender's plans.

##### Energy Bridge Anchors

A pair of dragon statues like the ones in area `D1` stands on the west side of the rotunda, and another pair stands on the southwest side. If the moonstone key is inserted in one of these statues, the western pair creates a bridge back to the overlook (area `D1`), and the southwestern pair creates a bridge to a crumbled and isolated tower (area `D4`).

#### D3: Kobold Camp

A rickety bridge made of driftwood and rope spans the 15-foot gap between the rotunda (area `D2`) and this structure.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Skittering sounds and whispers come from inside this ruined tower. Gaps in the stone are patched over with wooden planks and threadbare cloth.
^0b3

Three [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) (Ekrash, Erp, and Hev) and two [winged kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/winged-kobold.md) (Nuhro and Snirke) currently inhabit this camp, polishing [sling bullets](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sling-bullet.md) and keeping busy until it's time for Sparkrender's ritual. Initially, the kobolds are hostile toward the characters, determined to scare off the intruders. They are susceptible to intimidation, though; as an action, a character can make a DC 13 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check, convincing them to back down on a success.

#### D4: Isolated Study

No bridge spans the 22-foot gap between the rotunda and this spire, unless the characters use the moonstone key to activate the energy bridge in area `D2`. Characters might come up with any number of ingenious ways to cross the gap. See the sidebar called "Clever Solutions" for advice to help you determine whether these solutions work.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rhythm of the waves below echoes throughout this cramped tower. Part of the floor has crumbled away, dropping off into a chamber below. Amid the rubble, collapsed bookcases jut out at odd angles, and moldering books are strewn across the floor.
^0b5

##### Scholar's Journal

Though most of the books have fallen apart, one tome—a small black journal with an ornate lock—remains intact. A character who examines the book and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices a small arcane rune engraved above the keyhole on the journal's lock. A character who casts the [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell also sees a faint aura around the keyhole.

This rune is a magical trap that triggers if the journal is opened without the use of its original key, which is long lost. A character who makes a successful DC 11 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can determine how to disarm the trap: by carefully scratching over the rune with a dagger, a sharp piece of wire, or a similar implement. Once this is done, the journal can safely be opened either by picking the lock with thieves' tools and making a successful DC 10 Dexterity check, or by breaking the lock with a successful DC 12 Strength check. If the lock is opened without first disarming the trap, the magic trap spews out noxious green gas, and the character who opened the lock takes 3 (`1d6`) poison damage.

Inside, the journal contains star maps and notes on experiments with magic. One passage is underlined near the start of the journal. It reads, in an archaic dialect of Common, "To ye four scholars: point your eyes toward the Dragon's light, for it guides your descent into knowledge." This passage is a clue to unlocking the hidden entrance in the observatory tower (area `D5`).

> [!note] Clever Solutions
> 
> The challenges characters face in this adventure can have more than one solution. For example, to reach the isolated study (area `D4`), characters could try any of these approaches:
> 
> - Ask the winged kobolds to retrieve the moonstone key from area `D1` so it can be used again in area `D2`.  
> - Dive or climb down into the water below, swim over to the other column, and climb back up to the study.  
> - Have a character use the [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md) spell to cross the gap and explore alone.  
> 
> Remember, there's more than one way to proceed through an adventure, and more than one way to play D&D!

^clever-solutions

##### Treasure

A character who searches the tower and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a loose brick in the northwest wall. Pulling the brick out reveals a hidden compartment containing a [potion of resistance (lightning)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-lightning-resistance.md) (described in appendix A) and a [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) holding 10 gp.

#### D5: Observatory Tower

Standing taller than the rest of the observatory, the main floor of this tower is 45 feet above the ocean's surface, which puts it 15 feet above the floor of the rotunda (area `D2`). The kobolds have constructed a rough pulley lift so the wingless kobolds can reach this area when Sparkrender summons them.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rays of light dance across the remains of this tower's stained glass dome, making iridescent colors shimmer across the crumbled marble walls. Gilded lines and jeweled inlays form a detailed star map spanning the dusty floor. Four alabaster statues of scholars stand around the perimeter of the room, their expressions worn with time. Each ten-foot-tall statue is pointing or gesturing in a different direction.
> 
> Curled in the northeast corner of the tower is a lithe blue dragon. Lightning arcs around his horns and snout as he slumbers amid a scattered collection of coins and glittering jewels.
^0ba

Sparkrender the [blue dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md) is currently sleeping here, curled up against the northeast wall. This presents the characters with an important choice: they can waken the dragon and fight him now, or they can sneak past the dragon, find a way into the secret library below (area `D6`) and free [Aidron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md), and then fight Sparkrender with Aidron's help. Either approach is fine. The fight will be easier for the characters with Aidron on their side, but they can still triumph without Aidron's help.

You don't need to encourage one course of action or the other. Make sure the players realize they have a choice, though. You can use Mek and Minn (the kobolds from `D2`) to remind the characters there's another dragon around. As you describe the observatory tower, you can also highlight the caved-in wall beneath it (leading to area `D6`) as a potential point of access to the tower. Or you can just tell the players they have these two options—plus any others they come up with on their own!

##### Sneaking Around

If the characters move quietly around the area, they can avoid waking [Sparkrender](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md) as long as at least half of them succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check.

If the characters try to turn the statues (see "Hidden Entrance" below) without waking Sparkrender, have the characters turning the north and east statues (nearest the sleeping dragon) each make a DC 14 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. On a failed check, the noise of a turning statue wakes the dragon.

##### Waking the Dragon

If awakened, Sparkrender is hostile toward the characters, growling and barking threats in Draconic. Characters who speak Draconic (the paladin and the wizard) can try to convince the dragon not to attack by making a DC 12 Charisma check and applying the [Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill as appropriate. A character who succeeds on the check stops Sparkrender from attacking immediately, and he instead takes the opportunity to boast about his grand ambitions. If no character successfully intervenes, or if a character mentions Aidron or [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md), Sparkrender snarls and attacks.

Despite his youth, [Sparkrender](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md) is a fearsome foe and a loathsome villain. He uses Breath Weapon on his first turn and every round it is available thereafter. (Clever characters can try to use the statues for cover from the dragon's breath; see ""Cover"" in the "Basic Rules".) Consider having the wyrmling deliver short lines of dialogue on each of his turns, inspired by the following examples:

- "You pests will not stand in my way! I will claim the might of my ancestors!"  
- "Get out of here before I tire of this game and end you all!"  
- "Chromatic dragons are the rightful rulers of this world. Bow down to the children of Tiamat!"  
- "Enough of this! This work is too important to be hindered by the likes of you!"  

The dragon fights until reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, at which point he swears vengeance against the characters and attempts to flee the island starting on his next turn. (He might say something like this as he takes the [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action and flies away: "I swear by Eldenemir the Raging Storm and the five heads of Tiamat, you will pay for this insult!")

If the characters flee, Sparkrender does not pursue them, but he taunts them as they run away. (He might say something like, "Yes! Flee before my might, as all will flee when I claim my inheritance!")

If the characters defeat Sparkrender, they hear growling and yelping coming from below them (area `D6`).

##### Hidden Entrance

Each of the four statues can be rotated on its base. To unlock the hidden entrance to the observatory's secret archive, each statue must be rotated so it points at the constellation called the Dragon of Dawn on the floor's star map.

If the characters found the clue in the isolated study (area `D4`) exhorting "four scholars" to "point your eyes toward the Dragon's light," they might search the star map for a constellation that looks like a dragon. A character who searches the floor and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a constellation resembling a dragon in the southeast quadrant of the floor.

In lieu of that information, a character who searches the room for clues and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices worn grooves in the base of each statue, suggesting the statues can turn on their bases. While turning a statue, a character can make a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check; if the check succeeds, the character notices the statue settles slightly when it is pointing toward the southeast quadrant of the room and requires extra effort to nudge out of that position.

Once each statue is in its correct position, a semicircular section at the center of the floor begins to glow before descending into the library (area `D6`). It forms a spiral staircase leading down to the floor of the library. When any statue is rotated out of its position, the staircase rises back up, sealing the library shut once more. (A character on the staircase when this happens is lifted up to this area on the rising stairs.)

##### Treasure

With Sparkrender no longer defending his fledgling hoard, characters can gather it up. It includes large piles of coins: 4,500 cp, 2,200 sp, and 130 gp. There are also ten gems: five pale [blue quartz](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/blue-quartz.md) crystals worth 10 gp each and five blue [jasper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jasper.md) stones worth 50 gp each. A waterproof leather case holds a blue silk fan painted with powdered blue gems, worth 25 gp. There are also a few ordinary items Sparkrender enjoyed, including a crude flute with a pleasing sound, an hourglass filled with sparkling sand, and a set of seven candlesticks.

#### D6: Secret Library

This space was formerly a hidden archive of knowledge, accessible only to those who knew the observatory's secrets. However, the walls of the tower are crumbling—a fact that Sparkrender used to trap Aidron here. After weakening the bronze wyrmling, Sparkrender forced him into the library and then caused one of the walls to cave in, sealing the exit.

If the characters don't use the hidden entrance in area `D5`, they can attempt to clear away the rubble from the cave-in to access the secret library. To access the rubble, the characters must climb down from area `D5` or swim to the bottom of this spire and climb up from the water. Clearing the rubble takes one character 30 minutes, or the characters can work together to clear it faster (for example, it takes two characters 15 minutes or five characters 6 minutes). If the characters are trying to clear the rubble quietly, it takes twice as long, and at least half of the characters must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid waking Sparkrender.

Once they've cleared the rubble, the characters can access the library's interior.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stale air heavy with the smell of old parchment floods your nostrils. The walls are lined with shelves stuffed full of old tomes and yellowing scrolls. Glass cases, toppled over and shattered, have strewn their contents across the stone floor. The sound of splintering wood echoes through the space, and a moment later you see an agitated bronze dragon the size of a bear, picking himself up from the wreckage of the old desk he apparently crashed into.
^0c0

Aidron the [bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md) excitedly greets the characters when they enter. He has spent days trying to dig his way out through the caved-in wall, but his efforts from the inside only caused further collapse. He is eager to escape, but if the characters ask, he explains his conflict with Sparkrender. He expresses regret over his inability to defeat the blue wyrmling and concern for the safety of the island's other inhabitants. And he is terrified of the fate Sparkrender has in store for him—the blue dragon plans to use Aidron's death to claim the power of all the dead dragons on the island, transforming himself into a mighty draconic avatar.

If the characters have not yet defeated Sparkrender, Aidron decides to face the blue dragon himself. He flies to the top of the observatory tower (area `D5`) to confront Sparkrender once more. However, Aidron is too weak to defeat Sparkrender alone; he needs the characters' help.

Once Sparkrender is defeated, the bronze wyrmling is excited to return to Dragon's Rest with the characters.

##### Treasure

This library was once a repository of magical knowledge and items of power, though most of its contents are too weathered to read. However, a character who searches through the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a [+1 battleaxe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) or a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-2nd-level.md) of [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md) ([+1 weapons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) and [spell scrolls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) are both described in appendix A). A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals the location of both of these items without requiring an ability check. Aidron has also cataloged the contents of the room and can direct the characters to these valuable items.

## Sparkrender's Ritual

If the characters leave the observatory without defeating [Sparkrender](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md), they might return to find the blue wyrmling's ritual underway. This is most likely to happen if the characters leave and take a long rest before confronting Sparkrender, or if they flee from combat with Sparkrender and return after they've rested.

Another possibility is that the characters drive Sparkrender away from the island without killing him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in area `D6`. In this case, [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) urges the characters to return to the observatory to find Aidron. When they arrive, Sparkrender has also rested, healed, and returned to finish his work.

In either case, the characters arrive just as Sparkrender's ritual is getting underway. (If they took or destroyed the dragon effigies in area `D2`, they have been replaced by even cruder versions created in a hurry.) Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Streams of colored light swirl through the air around the golden statue in the ruined rotunda. Each shimmering display seems to originate from one of the five dragon effigies you saw before, and the lights' colors match the colors of the effigies: red, gold, brass, blue, and bronze. A blue dragon is perched atop the sculpture, throwing his head back in pain or ecstasy as the lights surround him, and he unleashes a bolt of lightning up toward the sky. At the base of the statue, a bronze dragon is bound to the ground by three heavy chains. He looks like he's in agony.
^0c3

To stop the ritual, the characters must face Sparkrender ([blue dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling.md)), potentially with the help of Aidron ([bronze dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/bronze-dragon-wyrmling.md)), if they can free Aidron from his chains (see "Freeing Aidron" below). Any surviving kobolds and winged kobolds lurk here, but they stay out of combat if possible.

See "Waking the Dragon" in area `D5` for ideas on how to play Sparkrender in this encounter. He uses Breath Weapon as the characters approach the scene (unleashing lightning into the sky), so he has to wait for this action to recharge before he can use it on the characters this time. He fights to the death—he has too much riding on the success of this ritual to abandon it now.

### Dragon Spirits

At the end of each round of combat (on initiative count 0, after everyone else has acted), a random magical effect occurs, caused by the magical lights that swirl around the rotunda. These lights are manifestations of the dragon spirits Sparkrender is trying to bind to himself, but their effects are unpredictable. Roll a `d10` and consult the Dragon Spirits table to see what happens.

`dice: [](5-chapter-4-clifftop-observatory.md#^dragon-spirits)`

| dice: d10 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1–2 | Astalagan's Blessing. Aidron and the characters each regain `1d4 + 4` hit points as the bronze light surrounds them with warmth. |
| 3–4 | Clyssavar's Flames. Sparkrender must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) fire damage as the golden light crashes into him. |
| 5–6 | Eldenemir's Gift. Sparkrender's Breath Weapon recharges as the blue light enfolds him. |
| 7–8 | Sharruth's Fury. Each of the characters must suceed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (`1d6`) fire damage as the red light erupts with fire. |
| 9–10 | Turadaer's Tricks. Aidron and the characters gain "advantage" on attack rolls and saving throws until initiative count 0 of the next round, as the brass light shimmers and sparks around them. |

### Freeing Aidron

Aidron is bound by three heavy chains that keep him [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). He can still take actions, such as biting or clawing an enemy that comes within his reach, but he knows Sparkrender is unaffected by his lightning Breath Weapon, so he doesn't bother using it. He might use his Repulsion Breath if he can see a good use for it.

Large clasps attach the chains to iron rings embedded in the ground. A character can use an action to undo one clasp. Once all three clasps are undone, Aidron is no longer [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), though the chains reduce his speed by 10 feet. Removing the chains from Aidron takes 10 minutes.

### Disrupting the Ritual

The most straightforward way to prevent Sparkrender from completing his ritual and obtaining the power he craves is to kill him. But characters can also use their actions in combat to interfere with the process and hinder Sparkrender in magical ways. Let the players try whatever they can imagine, using these ideas as examples:

- **Manipulate the Effigies.** A character might use an action to lift an effigy closer to the central sculpture, breathe a prayer to the dragon it represents, or otherwise coax magic from it. Doing so immediately triggers the corresponding effect from the Dragon Spirits Table.  
- **Destroy the Effigies.** A character might break an effigy or throw it over the crumbling wall and into the ocean below. This ensures the corresponding effect does not occur again. (Reroll if you get that result on the Dragon Spirits table.)  
- **Manipulate the Sculpture.** Characters might try to manipulate the golden sculpture as a way of disrupting the ritual. The sculpture is large and sturdy, though, so a single action has no noticeable effect on the sculpture or the magic. (The sculpture has AC 20, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.) However, disturbing the sculpture does distract Sparkrender. The first time a character uses an action to attack or otherwise try to disturb the sculpture, the distracted blue dragon has "disadvantage" on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of his next turn. Once he sees the character's meddling isn't very effective, he can't be distracted in this way again.  

## Ending the Adventure

With Aidron in tow, the characters can return victorious to Dragon's Rest. [Runara](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/runara-dosi.md) is pleased by the bronze wyrmling's safe return. As a reward, she gives each of the characters a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) and an exquisite [pearl](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pearl.md) worth 100 gp. She welcomes them to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish and furnishes them with whatever supplies they need for their travels when they're ready to leave the island. If Sparkrender is dead, she grieves the death of yet another dragon on Stormwreck Isle, but she doesn't condemn the characters for killing him.

If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures. The "Exploring the Island" section of chapter 1 offers additional encounters you can use if the characters haven't already faced them. Perhaps Sparkrender (or a relative of his) pursues the characters in search of revenge, or perhaps something uncovered in the secret library leads the characters to a distant locale in pursuit of more adventure.

If you want to advance these characters beyond 3rd level and create adventures for them, you'll need the "Basic Rules" or the advanced rulebooks: the "Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual".

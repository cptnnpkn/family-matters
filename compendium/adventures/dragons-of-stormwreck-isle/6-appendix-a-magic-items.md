# Appendix A: Magic Items
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle, p. 36* 

Every adventure holds the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding one or more magic items. *Dragons of Stormwreck Isle* contains an assortment of magic items that hints at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in the worlds of D&D.

## Using a Magic Item

A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. To learn more, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

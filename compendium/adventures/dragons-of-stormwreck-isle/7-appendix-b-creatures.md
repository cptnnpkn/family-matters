This appendix contains stat blocks and short descriptions for the creatures that appear in *Dragons of Stormwreck Isle*.

## Creature Stat Blocks

A creature's stat block provides the essential information that you, as the DM, need to run it. The following sections explain the various pieces of information you'll find in a stat block.

### Size

A stat block tells you a creature's size: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. "Size" is explained in the "Basic Rules".

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. When a creature is squeezing through such a space, its speed is halved, it has "disadvantage" on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have "advantage".

### Type

A creature's type is specified in a stat block, indicating the family of creatures that it belongs to. The types in the game are Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, and Undead.

### Alignment

A creature's alignment reflects its disposition. See Alignment in the "Basic Rules" for descriptions of the different alignments.

### Armor Class

A creature that wears armor or carries a shield has an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a creature's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or supernatural resilience it might possess.

If a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points

A stat block specifies a creature's hit point maximum. In parentheses, the stat block also indicates the Hit Dice that were rolled to determined those hit points, plus the creature's Constitution modifier multiplied by the number of Hit Dice.

### Speed

A creature's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see "Speed" in the "Basic Rules".

All creatures have a walking speed; those that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some of the creatures in this adventure have one or more additional movement modes:

- **Burrow.** A creature that has a burrowing speed can use all or part of its movement to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. It can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.  
- **Fly.** A creature that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) or knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) while flying, it falls unless it can hover.  
- **Swim.** A creature that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.  

### Ability Scores

Every creature has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores, see "Ability Scores and Modifiers" in the "Basic Rules".

### Saving Throws

The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more saving throws.

Saving throws in a stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Con +4," roll a `d20` and add 4 when the creature makes a saving throw using Constitution.

### Skills

The Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more skills.

Skills in a stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "[Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth) +4," roll a `d20` and add 4 when the creature makes an ability check using [Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth).

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. These immunities are also noted here.

### Senses

The Senses entry gives a creature's passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score, as well as any special senses the creature has, such as the following:

- **Blindsight.** A creature with [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) can perceive its surroundings without having to rely on sight, within a specific radius.  
- **Darkvision.** A creature with [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. The creature discerns color in darkness as shades of gray.  

### Languages

The languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order.

### Challenge

A well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating equal to the adventurers' level without any characters dying. Creatures weaker than 1st-level characters have challenge ratings lower than 1.

### Traits

In a stat block, traits are special features that appear right under the creature's Challenge entry.

### Actions

When a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the "Actions" section of its stat block and the options under "Actions" in the "Basic Rules".

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a creature takes in combat are melee and ranged attacks. See "Making an Attack" in the "Basic Rules" for how attacks work.

Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described here. As the DM, you can use the average damage or roll the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, if a monster deals 4 (`1d8`) slashing damage with its longsword, that notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll `1d8` to determine the damage.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities—whether they are traits, actions, or reactions—have restrictions on the number of times they can be used:

- **X/Day.** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used a certain number of times, and then the creature must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, "1/Day" means a special ability can be used once, and then the creature must finish a long rest to use it again.  

**Recharge X–Y**. The notation "Recharge X–Y" means a creature can use a special ability once, and then the ability has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, roll a `d6`. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of that special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest. For example, "Recharge 5–6" means a creature can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the creature's turn each round, it regains the use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a `d6`.

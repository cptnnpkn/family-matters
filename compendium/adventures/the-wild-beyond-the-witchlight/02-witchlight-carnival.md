# Witchlight Carnival
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, p. 23* 

The Witchlight Carnival is a fairground of kaleidoscopic tents and wagons crewed by wondrous beings, including many denizens of the Feywild. This is no ordinary carnival; it uses magic to travel from world to world across the Material Plane, visiting each world once every eight years and setting up business on the outskirts of populated areas. The carnival spends a few days at each location, then packs up and moves to another location on the same world until the decision is made to leave that world and visit the next. The carnival includes a fey crossing, allowing travel to and from the Feywild domain of Prismeer.

The characters are free to explore the carnival as they please. There are many paths through this chapter, so it can play out differently each time you run it.

![The Witchlight Carnival vi...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/012-01-001-chapter-splash.webp#center "The Witchlight Carnival visits a world once every eight years, bringing wonder and whimsy to the Material Plane")

## Running This Chapter

Before running the Witchlight Carnival, follow the steps below to help make the experience smoother:

- Familiarize yourself with the layout of the Witchlight Carnival. The map that appears in this chapter is a smaller version of the carnival poster map.  
- Read the chapter and familiarize yourself with the carnival's attractions. The characters can go anywhere at any time, so you need to be prepared for anything.  
- Prepare the tracking devices described in "Carnival Map." You'll need a `d8` to track the passage of time and another token to track the carnival's mood on the poster map.  

As the characters explore the carnival, you can keep a record of key events using the adventure's Story Tracker.

### Mysterious Benefactor

The characters have an ally in the carnival: a planeswalking gnome bard named Ellywick Tumblestrum. The characters don't know Tumblestrum, but she knows them because her lute has magic strings that whisper secrets to her as she plucks them. These strings guided the gnome bard to the carnival and revealed to Tumblestrum that the characters' fates are intertwined with the fate of Prismeer. She has bought a ticket for each character who isn't a carnival employee. (The tickets are waiting at the ticket booth by the entrance.)

Tumblestrum can be found in the Feasting Orchard (described later in the chapter) and serves as a helpful guide if the characters need direction.

### Carnival Map

On the poster map of the carnival, use a miniature figure or some other token to mark where each character is located at any given time. If the characters split up, the tokens will make it easier to keep track of everyone.

The poster map has places to track two crucial elements: the passage of time and the carnival's mood.

#### Tracking Time

The Witchlight Carnival opens at dusk and runs for eight hours, ending just before dawn. When the characters enter the carnival, place a `d8` at the start of the track in the upper left corner of the poster map with the "1" facing up. Move the die to the next space at the end of each in-game hour, and turn the die so that its uppermost face shows the hour that is now beginning. Don't worry about managing things down to the minute. If the players (and their characters) seem to be having fun, you can slow down the passage of time to give them time to enjoy the carnival's attractions. If the game starts to lag or if the characters spend a lot of time engaged in the same activity, advance the die to the next hour.

Three events take place every night at a particular hour:

- **Hour 1.** Welcome Gifts. Small gifts are handed out to lucky guests.  
- **Hour 4.** Big Top Extravaganza. A midnight show gives the characters the chance to dazzle spectators and impress the carnival's ringmaster.  
- **Hour 8.** Crowning the Witchlight Monarch. The carnival's climactic event gives the characters a chance to meet the carnival's mysterious owners.  

Each event is detailed in the "Timed Events" section toward the end of the chapter.

#### Tracking Mood

The characters' actions in the Witchlight Carnival can affect the overall mood at the carnival. When the characters arrive at the carnival, place a token in the starting space of the track in the lower right corner of the poster map. This token moves right or left along the track as the carnival's atmosphere changes for better or worse.

The text informs you when to raise or lower the mood. When the token is to the right of the starting space, spirits are high: colors appear more vibrant, flowers bloom around the fairgrounds, and shooting stars sweep across the clear night sky. When the token is to the left of the starting space, the mood becomes darker: the calliope music plays discordantly, the staff is tense, and stormy weather looms in the sky above the carnival.

The carnival's mood is used to trigger an important meeting between the characters and the carnival owners. If the mood reaches either of the end spaces on the track, the carnival's owners invite the characters to speak with them in their wagon (see "Meeting Witch and Light" toward the end of the chapter). Characters who attend the Big Top Extravaganza can also receive an invitation to meet with the owners, even if the carnival's mood isn't in an extreme state.

> [!note] Witch and Light's Hourglass Pact
> 
> When the hags of the Hourglass Coven took control of Prismeer, they gained leverage over [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md). The hags know that Witch and Light are not the carnival's original owners and have threatened to divest them of their status by orchestrating a reunion between the Witchlight Carnival and its counterpart in the Shadowfell (which would force Witch and Light to give up the former and return to the latter).
> 
> Terrified of losing their Feywild fair, the two shadar-kai have agreed to let the coven steal from anyone who sneaks into the carnival without a ticket. Witch and Light have tried to neutralize this situation by diligently checking all visitors for tickets, but some unfortunates inevitably slip through, making them targets for the hags' thieves (see "Thieves of the Coven").
^witch-and-lights-hourglass-pact

## Carnival Owners

The owners of the Witchlight Carnival are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md). Witch is matter-of-fact and devoid of pretense, while Light is flamboyant and coy.

How Witch and Light came to possess the carnival is a story worth telling. Under different names, they owned another carnival that prowled the edges of the Shadowfell. The two carnivals crossed paths many years ago, and after much wine was consumed, the owners could not agree on which carnival was the better of the two, so they decided it would be great fun to swap ownership. Isolde, the eladrin who ran the fey-themed carnival, traded places with the two shadar-kai who ran the shadow-themed carnival. This arrangement would last until the two carnivals met again, which has not yet happened.

After trading their sinister carnival for a more lighthearted one, the two shadar-kai took the names Witch and Light. Gradually, these morose, emotionally stunted shadar-kai transformed into fun-loving free spirits who secretly dread the day when the two carnivals cross paths again. They have no desire to return to their gloomy old carnival, which is described in more detail in "Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft".

The shadar-kai are aware that the Hourglass Coven has usurped Zybilna's domain in the Feywild. They don't know how the coven accomplished this coup, but Witch and Light would like nothing more than to see the hags defeated and Zybilna returned to power. But they dare not play a part in making that dream a reality. If the coven caught a whiff of dissent from Witch and Light, the hags would punish the shadar-kai for their impudence (see the "Witch and Light's Hourglass Pact" sidebar). Witch and Light do what they can to appease the hags while secretly rooting for Zybilna's return. They know Zybilna's true identity but dare not reveal it.

Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md).

### Mister Witch

Witch, who used to go by the name Naeryx Krumple, spent his youth as a homeless orphan, eking out a meager and dreary existence on the fog-shrouded streets of Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell. He earned a few coppers selling broadsheets as a young boy, then later swept floors until an old clock tower keeper took him on as a helper. The tower's clock was in such poor condition that it would break down often. Naeryx helped with the repairs and found that the work gave him a sliver of joy. When the old keeper died years later, Naeryx replaced him.

The wealthy family that owned the clock tower didn't pay Naeryx a lot of money for his work, but they occasionally had him over for dinner. He owned one fine suit that he wore on such occasions, and though he didn't care for the family's matriarch or patriarch, he enjoyed the company of their eldest son, Urmius Umbrage—a brooding shadar-kai ne'er-do-well with a cruel sense of humor. Naeryx and Urmius were close in age and got along well in all respects. Years later, without informing the rest of his family, Urmius bought a run-down carnival and persuaded Naeryx to help him operate it. Naeryx and Urmius—now calling themselves [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md)—have been partners and collaborators ever since.

#### Mister Witch's Description

[Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) looks like a distinguished gentleman, for he is always dressed in fine attire. His favorite accoutrements are a top hat and a cane, and he is never without his [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md), which was gifted to him by the carnival's previous owner. This unique magic item is described below.

![Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/013-637677442905361755.webp#center)

### Mister Light

Light, formerly known as Urmius Umbrage, belonged to a filthy rich shadar-kai family that haunted a crumbling mansion in Gloomwrought. Although he wanted for nothing as a child, Urmius found himself surrounded by family members, caretakers, and teachers who were uniformly cold, callous, and mean-spirited. He grew tired of being seen as nothing more than the inheritor of the Umbrage estate and legacy, and he did everything in his power to make life miserable for everyone around him, especially his parents. He seemed bereft of ambition and spent much of his time playing in his room. He collected costumes and liked nothing more than to parade around Umbrage Mansion in strange garments and outlandish makeup.

Urmius first met Naeryx Krumple at a family dinner and didn't think much of the clock tower keeper at first. But Urmius found himself taken aback by Naeryx's ability to find even a small amount of joy in his work. He was eager to get to know Naeryx better, though it took a while for Naeryx to trust him. After getting his hands on some money, Urmius bought a sad little carnival that was camped on the outskirts of Gloomwrought and asked Naeryx to help him run it. For Urmius, the carnival was a chance to emerge from under his family's shadow and become the master of his own fate, but it also meant forsaking his inheritance in order to embrace the unconventional lifestyle, fashions, and friendships he desired.

![Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/014-637677442564423044.webp#center)

#### Mister Light's Description

[Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) has a slender frame. He is always dressed in some sort of costume and is rarely seen in public without makeup. He carries around a fancy weather vane given to him by the carnival's previous owner. He twirls it and waves it around like a fool's scepter, but its power is far greater than he lets on. With this magic vane, he can affect the mood of everyone in the Witchlight Carnival.

## Witchlight Hands

[Witchlight hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) are the backbone of the Witchlight Carnival, a motley collection of individuals who operate many of the booths, make repairs, feed and exercise the animals, keep an eye out for thieves and other miscreants, and perform other miscellaneous tasks as [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) dictates. A few also work part-time as performers and attractions. Although they travel to many worlds throughout the Material Plane, Witchlight hands rarely leave the carnival grounds. The carnival is the only world they know and care about.

The carnival employs 124 Witchlight hands in total. All hands enter into an agreement when they join the carnival: they must never harm another staff member, and they can't leave the carnival for more than a day at a time. (A longer absence is equivalent to resignation, in [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s estimation.) On-duty staff members are required to wear fake butterfly wings strapped to their backs. [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) also furnish them with small amounts of [pixie dust](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pixie-dust-wbtw.md) (see appendix A).

Witchlight hands are paid only a small fraction of the carnival's profits, but it's enough to keep them fed, clothed, and cared for. Some hands work longer hours or do extra chores to pay off debts and loans.

Most Witchlight hands are taught how to perform minor magic tricks, which they use to amuse themselves as well as entertain the masses. (Characters who have the Witchlight hand background don't learn magic as part of their upbringing, but they can choose to account for this by selecting a spellcasting class.)

## Carnival Overview

Use the following boxed text to describe the carnival to new arrivals:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The first stars of night twinkle above the apricot sunset. Giant dragonflies whir overhead, trailing streamers, and a low mist curls over the ground. Through a floral archway, you glimpse wondrous and vibrant creatures—elf stilt walkers, dancing faeries, and painted performers. Everywhere there is laughter, pixie dust, bubbles, and the wistful tune of a whistling calliope.
^076

The Witchlight Carnival travels as a convoy of wagons, each one pulled by horses or foxes depending on its size. When they need to soar between worlds, the wagons and their draft animals sprout butterfly wings and take to the starry sky. On land, the carnival's attractions unfold magically from the wagons, controlled by [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md).

When the carnival arrives at a new destination, a [treant sapling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-sapling-wbtw.md) named Northwind uses its Animate Trees ability to gently relocate trees that are in the way of the unfolded wagons. A great length of blue ribbon transforms into a lazy, sparkling river, encircling the site. The river is 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep at its center.

![Welcome to the Witchlight Carnival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/015-map-1-1.webp#center)

### Carnival Etiquette

There's no handbook for how guests of the Witchlight Carnival are expected to behave; certain actions are tolerated, while others cause offense. Politeness goes a long way: paying attention when spoken to, laughing at jokes, and joining in with games and singing. Every so often, you can raise the carnival's mood by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) if the party is consistently polite to carnival staff and fellow attendees.

Conversely, acts such as interrupting someone, being rude, or grumpily refusing to dance are unfavorable. Lower the carnival's mood by 1 step if the characters actively offend anyone they meet.

#### Theft and Violence

Characters who are caught stealing or fighting are asked to leave the carnival; in this case, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step as `1d6` [Witchlight hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (chaotic good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) escort the troublemakers to the gates.

^carnival-scenes

### Wandering Outsiders

Several meddling outsiders can be encountered at various times throughout the evening.

#### Kettlesteam

Kettlesteam is a kenku warlock whose patron is the archfey Zybilna of Prismeer. Having sensed that something is wrong with her beloved patron, Kettlesteam has come to the carnival seeking answers. The carnival owners refuse to speak to her—and until they come clean, she is committed to causing trouble. Kettlesteam uses [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) to assume whatever form best enables her to mingle in crowds.

Characters can encounter Kettlesteam in more than one location; if they corner her, she provides valuable clues about Prismeer. For details, see "Catching Kettlesteam" later in the chapter.

#### Thieves of the Coven

Each member of the Hourglass Coven employs a thief that visits the carnival to steal from ticketless victims. These thieves enter and exit through the Hall of Illusions, using it as a gateway to their mistresses' splinter-realms of Hither, Thither, and Yon. The carnival staff has been instructed by [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) to ignore them.

These thieves possess a preternatural awareness of who is a carnival worker and who is a ticket-carrying visitor. Every night of the carnival, they haunt the dark spaces between wagons and attractions, scanning the crowds for ticketless interlopers. Characters who have tickets or who work at the carnival are not targets for these thieves. Some characters might catch glimpses of these spooky figures as reflections in mirrors, shadows in doorways, or out-of-place figures standing motionless in the moving crowd. Use these thieves as you please to add an undercurrent of dread or mystery to the carnival's frivolities.

The three thieves are fiercely loyal to their hag mistresses and won't willingly reveal anything if caught. They are as follows:

- [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md)'s thief is one of her lornlings—a miniature version of herself. Use the [quickling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/quickling-mpmm.md) stat block in appendix C to represent this toad-like creature.  
- [Skabatha Nightshade](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md)'s thief is Sowpig, a Small [ghoul](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) with 17 (`5d6`) hit points. She appears as a little, gray-skinned girl wearing a pig mask and holding an oversized lollipop.  
- [Endelyn Moongrave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md)'s thief is the [detached shadow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/detached-shadow-wbtw.md) of Gleam, a high elf acrobat who wears a crescent moon mask. (Gleam herself has vanished from the carnival. The characters won't meet her until chapter 4.) Gleam's [detached shadow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/detached-shadow-wbtw.md) uses the [shadow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) stat block, except it is a Fey instead of an Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by the shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) instead. The creature regains consciousness and the reduction to its Strength score disappears after it finishes a short or long rest.  

Each thief has the following additional action options, which it uses to achieve its goals:

> [!note] 
> 
> **No Ticket.** The thief targets one carnival guest it can see within 5 feet of it. If the target doesn't have a ticket, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. It retains no memory of events that occur while it is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) in this way. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this particular thief's No Ticket ability for the next 24 hours.
> 
> **Sticky Fingers.** The thief targets one [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) creature it can see within 5 feet of it and steals one item weighing 10 pounds or less from that creature. Whatever it steals disappears, reappearing in the space of the hag to which the thief is beholden.

## Carnival Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map of the Witchlight Carnival. The ticket booth is described first, since it stands near the entrance. All other locations are presented alphabetically.

### Ticket Booth

The booth where visitors buy their tickets is located at the main entrance.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A silver statue of a dancing faerie is mounted on the roof of this ticket booth and surrounded by fluttering butterflies. The booth is decorated with an animated depiction of the night sky, with shooting stars arcing across it.
> 
> An elderly goblin perches behind the ticket counter, peering at you quizzically through a spyglass. He lowers the spyglass and calls out to you: "Greetings, fair fairgoers!"
^082

Visitors are expected to buy tickets at this booth. An adult's ticket costs 8 sp, and a child's ticket costs 3 sp. Instead of paying money, a visitor can try to barter with the ticketer, Nikolas Midnight, a wrinkled [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) (see "Bartering for a Ticket" below). For more information on Nikolas Midnight, see "Roleplaying Nikolas" below.

Under the ticket counter is an ornate wooden box with a silver clasp and the monogram N.M. It contains one prepaid ticket for each visiting character. These tickets were purchased by Ellywick Tumblestrum, but Tumblestrum has asked Nikolas not to divulge this information. Instead, Nikolas claims that these tickets were paid for by "an anonymous benefactor."

After giving the characters their tickets, Nikolas hands the group a map of the carnival and gives each character a pair of colorful cloth butterfly wings to wear. Nikolas explains that the butterfly wings must be worn to show the staff that the characters are paid attendees. They are now free to explore the carnival at their leisure.

#### How the Tickets Work

Nikolas explains that each ticket is good for eight attractions; characters who want to sample more of the carnival's offerings must buy another ticket. Most attractions in the carnival have a cost of 1 ticket punch. After the eighth punch, a ticket becomes a worthless keepsake.

> [!note] Sneaking Inside
> 
> The carnival issues fake butterfly wings to every visitor who receives a ticket. Visitors are expected to wear their wings, or at least carry them around, while inside the carnival. The tickets and fake wings are theirs to keep.
> 
> Any character who tries to sneak into the carnival without a set of fake butterfly wings must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check or be spotted and approached by `1d3` [Witchlight hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) of any alignment (see the stat block earlier in the chapter). The hands ask to see the character's ticket; any character without a ticket is escorted to the main entrance and directed to the ticket booth. If the character runs away from the Witchlight hands, the hands don't bother giving chase, but the carnival's mood lowers by one step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in this chapter). A character without butterfly wings who successfully sneaks into the carnival must repeat the check at the end of each hour.
^sneaking-inside

#### Bartering for a Ticket

Any visitor who can't afford the price of a ticket or who doesn't want to pay for a ticket can make a fey pact with Nikolas instead. Each pact is a one-night-only deal that ends when the Witchlight Monarch is crowned (see "Timed Events" toward the end of the chapter). If a character chooses to enter into such a pact, roll on the Ticket Pacts table to determine the conditions. A character who barters for multiple tickets can have more than one pact in effect; if any table result comes up twice, choose a different result.

Any character who fulfills the conditions of a pact should be a strong contender for the title of Witchlight Monarch. A character who doesn't abide by the pact loses their ticket, which transforms into an ordinary bat and flaps away. In addition, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

**Ticket Pacts**

`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^ticket-pacts)`

| dice: d8 | Pact |
|----------|------|
| 1 | You must not tell a lie knowingly. |
| 2 | You must wear a crown of flowers and water it every hour without taking it off. |
| 3 | You must perform a short dance whenever you hear someone say your name. |
| 4 | You can't talk about your favorite subject. |
| 5 | You must carry around a small pumpkin as though it were a precious egg. |
| 6 | You must greet all trees with reverence. |
| 7 | You must compliment everyone you meet. |
| 8 | You must declare your love for unicorns at every opportunity. |
^ticket-pacts

#### Roleplaying Nikolas

Nikolas (lawful neutral) carries a spyglass and an ear horn, which he uses when talking to patrons. Nikolas plays on the fact that he is old when using these items, but it's all a ruse; he is as sharp as a thorn, and his instruments allow him to get the true measure of guests. In his hands, the spyglass and ear horn grant Nikolas advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks to discern lies and determine true intent. Characters who attempt to deceive Nikolas must succeed on a Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check contested by the goblin's Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

If one or more characters seem intent on disrupting the carnival, Nikolas scribbles a brief note to that effect and hands it to an [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [pixie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) that lurks under the ticket counter. The pixie delivers Nikolas's message to [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md), who informs the carnival staff to keep a close eye on the group, and the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

### Big Top

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The roof of this tent reaches toward the night sky in three swooping peaks topped with spinning gold stars. Painted wooden panels on the tent walls whirl with colorful motion, displaying vibrant circus performances. The sound of music and laughter drifts out through the canvas door.
^088

Customers can enter the Big Top for free.

The Big Top is the setting for two main events: the Big Top Extravaganza and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch, both of which are described in the "Timed Events" section toward the end of the chapter. In the hours leading up to midnight, carnival barkers stationed throughout the fair declare, "Big Top Extravaganza tonight at midnight! Prepare to be delighted!" After midnight, these barkers shout, "Who will be crowned our Witchlight Monarch? Join us in the Big Top just before dawn to find out!"

Aside from those scheduled events, a variety of entertainers perform here. Colorful orbs of light dance in the lofts of the tent while magic spotlights highlight performers. Spectators watch the acts from rows of tiered wooden seats encircling the ring. You can randomly determine an act by rolling on the Big Top Acts table, or you can create new acts using the table's entries as inspiration.

**Big Top Acts**

`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^big-top-acts)`

| dice: d8 | Act |
|----------|-----|
| 1 | Tiny firefly circus managed by an ogre dressed like a djinni |
| 2 | Halfling contortionist who can fit inside a hatbox |
| 3 | Pixies racing chariots pulled by weasels (eight pixies and sixteen weasels in all) |
| 4 | Satyr fiddler whose music causes dancing plants to burst from the ground |
| 5 | Troupe of eight clowns launching themselves from a magic cannon |
| 6 | Tiefling fire-breather who summons capering magma mephits and smoke mephits that disappear after 1 minute |
| 7 | Goblin juggler who can catch and juggle any tiny objects tossed to her by the crowd (up to eight objects at a time) |
| 8 | Elf ballerina who dances with animated costumes that spring from a magic wardrobe |
^big-top-acts

#### Dressing Room

The backstage area is a smaller, circular tent adjoining the Big Top. The curtained doorway between the Big Top and the dressing room is guarded by two [Witchlight hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (chaotic good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter), who bicker over the appeal of the acts while sharing a bottle of pear cider. They allow only performers and other Witchlight hands to pass through the curtain but are so distracted by their arguing that any character can slip past them unseen with a successful DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This dressing room is a scene of colorful clutter: tables strewn with makeup kits and glass jewelry, mirrors trimmed with glowing orbs of light, and chests of drawers and wardrobes spilling over with garments.

If a character searches the dressing room for something fun, roll on the Costumes and Accessories table to determine what they find.

### Bubble-Pop Teapot

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A twenty-foot-tall teapot rests on a wooden platform, its painted surface whirling with moving imagery of flying dragons breathing streams of bubbles. A door at the base of the teapot allows entry to its interior; those who enter emerge from the spout enclosed in a bubble that detaches to float off across the carnival. Seven goblins sits around the platform, sipping tea from mismatched porcelain cups.
^08c

This ride costs 1 ticket punch. The ride is managed by a friendly goblin noncombatant named Treaclewise (chaotic good), who wears bright yellow butterfly wings and carries a string of teaspoons on his belt. Seven more friendly goblins sit and chatter around the giant teapot while sipping tea. When the characters approach, Treaclewise gestures to a sign on his table that reads:

> [!note] 
> 
> *The word that you intend to say,*
> 
> *Try saying it a different way.*
^08d

Treaclewise loves to talk in rhyming slang, substituting everyday words with nonsense rhymes. When explaining how the bubble ride works, he might say the following:

- "Toil and trouble" instead of "bubble"  
- "Gnarly tree knot" instead of "teapot"  
- "Bramble thicket" instead of "ticket"  

If a character engages with Treaclewise in rhyming slang, he chuckles and gifts the character with a pouch of Scatterleaf Tea.

#### Scatterleaf Tea

As an action, a creature can scatter these tea leaves on the ground in a 5-foot-radius circle, duplicating the effect of a [protection from evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md) spell that lasts for 10 minutes. To gain the spell's protection, a creature must stand in the circle of tea leaves. In addition, a cup of hot, delicious tea magically appears in the protected creature's hands. A pouch contains enough leaves for one use.

#### Taking a Bubble Ride

Any Large or smaller creature that enters the teapot is enveloped in a magic bubble that floats up through the teapot's spout and into the sky, granting its occupant wonderful aerial views of the carnival. When the bubble pops after 1 minute, the passenger floats gently to the ground. Each bubble can hold only one creature (the smaller the creature, the smaller its bubble), plus whatever the creature is wearing or carrying.

A character suspended in the bubble can make a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check, gaining control of the bubble on a success. The character can then steer the bubble and pop it over any location on the carnival map. On a failed check, the character has no control over their bubble, and it pops over a random location. If a character tries to steer a bubble out of the carnival, it pops at the perimeter.

### Calliope

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A merry tune spills forth from an instrument on the back of a brightly painted wagon. A monkey wearing a cloak covered with buttons turns a handle at the wagon's rear, sending music into the air from rows of golden whistles. As you watch, a goblin dressed as a ladybug toddles up to you, rattling a tin cup.
^092

The calliope can be heard throughout the carnival and is magically linked to the carnival's mood. When people are happy, it pipes along merrily, but it plays discordantly when the mood is low. Each of the calliope's whistles is imbued with magical gusts of wind, allowing it to play without end.

Ernest the monkey turns the handle of a piano roll; the punched holes in the roll of parchment provide the melody. Ernest has the mind of a middle-aged human, the result of a prank involving the organ grinder, his pet monkey, a leprechaun, and a great quantity of brambleberry wine. The organ grinder's mind was swapped with his monkey's, but the jest turned to disaster when his body ran off with the monkey's mind inside, never to be seen again. Ernest uses the [baboon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/baboon.md) stat block, but his Intelligence and Charisma are 10, and he can speak Common. His alignment is neutral good.

Ernest likes to collect buttons from the carnival's guests to sew onto his cloak. He has a rhyme for requesting them:

> [!note] 
> 
> *Spare a button if you please,*
> 
> *I'll sew it next to all of these.*
> 
> *I offer nothing in its place,*
> 
> *Besides a smile upon my face.*
^093

Marigold (chaotic good), the goblin dressed as a ladybug, collects the proffered buttons in a tin cup and delivers them to Ernest. Marigold is sprightly and often cajoles bystanders into dancing.

On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of characters who give at least one button to Ernest. If one or more of these characters find themselves trapped or captured in Prismeer, they hear the distant whistling of the calliope and can follow the music to safety. Any barriers or obstacles in their way are magically removed. For example, the lock on a cell door might spring open on its own, a guard might fall asleep, or a silent, spectral monkey resembling Ernest might appear and reveal the shortest route to freedom. This is a tool to help the characters out of a tight spot and can be used only once per group.

### Carousel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A procession of wooden unicorns stands motionless on a circular wooden platform. Fairgoers clamber onto the unicorns' backs, and a female centaur sets the ride in motion. The unicorns shake their manes and creak to life, cantering around the carousel to the delight of their riders.
^095

A ride on the carousel costs 1 ticket punch.

#### Diana Cloppington

The individual who checks tickets and operates the carousel is named Diana Cloppington. Once a human, Diana sought the help of Granny Nightshade of the Hourglass Coven, desperately wishing to be reunited with her warhorse, which went missing in battle. The cruel hag magically fused the bodies of Diana and her horse, giving her the appearance of a centaur. Diana fled Prismeer and befriended [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md), who offered her a home in their carnival.

Diana greets patrons with good humor, but there's a sadness behind her eyes. She's quick to correct anyone who calls her a centaur, saying that she's "a human who made a bad deal." If Diana discovers that the characters are investigating the carnival for their own reasons, she tells them how a hag made good on a promise to reunite Diana with her missing horse; however, due to the nature of her bargain with the hag, there are several things that Diana can't talk about:

![Diana Cloppington](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/018-01-004-diana-cloppington.webp#center)

- The Hourglass Coven  
- Zybilna's current predicament  
- Prismeer's current state  

If she tries to speak or write about these forbidden topics, she painfully coughs up brown tree sap, or mushrooms blister on her fingers until she ceases her attempts. The carousel's wooden unicorns, however, can supply the characters with clues related to the hags (see "Riddle of the Carousel" below). Diana tells them that they must "speak to the unicorns," but to earn their trust they must learn the names of all eight unicorns. Diana gives one of the characters a clay pot of gold paint and some paintbrushes. She says she can close the carousel for a short time while it undergoes some "essential repairs."

#### Riddle of the Carousel

The carousel's eight unicorns ride in pairs, and each unicorn wears a name tag on its bridle. Some of the names are legible, while other name tags are worn and indecipherable.

The names for each pair of unicorns are key words from a well-known proverb. Before any of the unicorns share secrets with their riders, all of them must have their correct names painted on their tags. One unicorn in each pair has some letters missing from its name tag, but players who are familiar with the proverbs can fill in the missing letters.

- **First Pair.** The first two unicorns are named Fortune and Bold, from the proverb "Fortune favors the bold." Fortune's name tag is complete, but Bold's name tag reads B _ _ _.  
- **Second Pair.** These unicorns' names are Pride and Fall, from the proverb "Pride goes before a fall." Fall's name tag is complete, but Pride's name tag reads PR _ _ _.  
- **Third Pair.** These unicorns' names are Stone and Moss, from the proverb "A rolling stone gathers no moss." Stone's name tag is complete, but Moss's name tag reads M _ _ S.  
- **Fourth Pair.** The last two unicorns are named Stitch and Nine, from the proverb "A stitch in time saves nine." Stitch's name tag is complete, but Nine's name tag reads _ _ N _.  

If you are running this adventure for players who don't have a good grasp of English proverbs, use different pairs of words that the players will have an easier time identifying. For example, each pair of unicorns might have names that are synonymous with each other, such as Jolly/Merry (M E _ _ _), Breeze/Gust (G _ _ T), Tale/Yarn (_ _ R N), and Dawn/Sunrise (S _ _ _ I S _). Otherwise, choose names from idioms or proverbs with which your players are familiar.

When the characters are done painting names on the unicorns, Diana offers them a free ride on the attraction. Any unicorn whose name is incorrect gives a disgruntled whinny, and the characters learn nothing from any of the unicorns if they are ridden. If all the unicorns' names are correct, each unicorn telepathically shares with its rider three secrets about Prismeer or the Hourglass Coven during this ride. These secrets can be imparted in response to questions asked by the character, or they can be shared without a prompt if the character doesn't know what to ask.

##### Lost Things Secrets

If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook, a unicorn shares the following information with its rider:

- The character learns which hag has the lost thing they're looking for ([Bavlorna Blightstraw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md), [Skabatha Nightshade](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md), or [Endelyn Moongrave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md)).  
- The character is told that Bavlorna's lair is a rambling cottage on stilts in a fey swamp, Skabatha's lair is a dead, hollowed-out tree in a sylvan forest, and Endelyn's lair is a mountaintop theater.  
- The character learns a useful secret tied to the hag in question: "The hag you seek is allergic to seeing someone run widdershins" (for Bavlorna), "The hag you seek sleeps in a dollhouse and can't remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up" (for Skabatha), or "The hag you seek has foreseen her own death, which happens during an eclipse" (for Endelyn).  

##### Warlock's Quest Secrets

If you used the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook, a character receives the following information while in telepathic contact with one of the carousel's unicorns:

- Zybilna of Prismeer is frozen in time.  
- Three hags have seized control of Zybilna's domain and split it among them. Together, these hags form the Hourglass Coven.  
- The hags' names are [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md), [Skabatha Nightshade](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md), and [Endelyn Moongrave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md), and their splinter-realms are called Hither, Thither, and Yon. The coven is so riddled with distrust that each hag is convinced her sisters are plotting against her.  

### Dragonfly Rides

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Huge lily pads rest on the surface of a pool glistening with phosphorescent algae. Giant dragonflies use the lily pads as landing platforms, buzzing loudly overhead with wings as brilliant as stained-glass windows, and alighting briefly to drop off and pick up excited passengers.
> 
> Near the entrance, a small, smiling tree turns your way and beckons you over. A red squirrel clings to its leafy canopy, peering at you suspiciously.
^09b

Northwind, a Prismeer native, is a carefree [treant sapling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-sapling-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block). Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Northwind. Northwind's squirrel companion, Red, sizes up guests while keeping at least one beady eye on Northwind's acorns. Red is the beneficiary of a druid's [awaken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/awaken.md) spell; he uses the [weasel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/weasel.md) stat block but has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common.

![Treant Sapling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/019-637677446430863372.webp#center)

#### Dragonfly Riding

Riding a dragonfly costs 1 ticket punch. There are eight [giant dragonflies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-dragonfly-wbtw.md) (see appendix C), which are trained to fly their riders in a lazy figure eight around the carnival's thoroughfare, at a height of 20 feet. A character who tries to steer their dragonfly off course must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check to do so. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of any characters who succeed on the Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check to redirect a giant dragonfly; these characters have a talent that might benefit them in chapter 4 (see area M20).

As the characters' first ride begins, shouts of alarm erupt from a nearby lily pad. A giant dragonfly has just taken off prematurely with a patron on its back: a middle-aged dwarf with a bright blue beard sits unfastened in his harness. Kettlesteam, a kenku warlock, used a [speak with animals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-animals.md) spell to panic the dragonfly. Characters can spot Kettlesteam before she slips away with a successful Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check contested by the kenku's Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. See "Catching Kettlesteam" later in the chapter if the characters try to confront her.

A character can calm the startled mount and guide it back to a lily pad with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. The carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) if a character succeeds on this check. If the characters fail to rescue the dwarf, he tumbles from the dragonfly's back; luckily, his fall is cushioned by a tent awning, and though he isn't badly hurt, the mood of the carnival lowers by 1 step.

#### Questioning Northwind

Northwind is terrible at keeping secrets. If questioned about the carnival, the treant loudly whispers the following bits of information, preceding each with "I'm not really supposed to talk about this, but..."

- "[Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) aren't the carnival's original owners, y'know. They're not even from the Feywild! But it matters not an inch! We're all one big, happy family here!"  
- "The carnival can't run without [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s pocket watch—I hope he never loses it!"  
- "There's nothing [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) likes more than a sea of smiling faces—if the carnival's happy, he's happy!"  

Northwind doesn't know about the Hourglass Coven or what has become of Prismeer or its archfey ruler; it thinks the domain is still thriving under Zybilna's rule.

### Feasting Orchard

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Music and mirth radiate from this park. The heady scents of flowers, mead, and berry pie waft through the air. Stilt-walkers pluck fruit from trees; musicians drum, pipe, and strum; and everywhere there is singing, dancing, and an inordinate amount of custard.
^09f

The Feasting Orchard bustles all through the night with the activity of storytellers, musicians, and acrobats. The feasting tables are lined with merrymakers, and dances spring up at the drop of a hat.

#### Faerie Cake Eating Contest

This contest runs repeatedly throughout the evening and costs 1 ticket punch to enter. The contest table is piled high with small, glazed cupcakes, each filled with a dollop of berry custard. The goal is simple: eat as many cupcakes as you can within 60 seconds.

A contestant can swallow a cupcake in about 3 seconds and safely eat as many cupcakes as 3 + its Constitution modifier; for each additional cake eaten, the contestant must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take `1d8` custard damage. Subtract custard damage from the contestant's hit points as normal. Any contestant reduced to 0 hit points by custard damage is unable to continue, loses the contest, and has custard splattered all over them. At the end of the contest, all contestants regain the hit points they lost from taking custard damage.

##### Treasure

The prize for winning the contest is a cupcake that functions like a [potion of invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invisibility.md). The whole cupcake must be eaten to gain its benefit.

#### Ellywick Tumblestrum

This gnome bard ("Tumblestrum" to her friends) is in the Feasting Orchard when the characters first arrive. She sits on a swing that hangs from the branch of a pear tree, plucking the strings on her lute while eyeing the characters. If the characters happen to mention their free tickets, she reveals that she was the one who paid for them. When pressed for more information, she cryptically assures the characters that they're exactly where and when they're supposed to be but says no more.

![Ellywick Tumblestrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/020-01-005-ellywick-tumblestrum.webp#center)

As the night progresses, Tumblestrum can reappear to provide hints about what the group needs to do; she can even guide the characters to Prismeer if all of their plans fall through (see "Tumblestrum's Intervention" in the "Timed Events" section later in the chapter). If she is threatened, she disappears in a flashy yet harmless pyrotechnic display. No stat block for Tumblestrum is necessary, since she won't harm or hinder the characters and can't be seriously harmed by them. Her thoughts are likewise hidden, since no magic can read them.

Tumblestrum is meant to be an enigma to the player characters. In truth, she is a savvy planar traveler who has visited and entertained folks on countless worlds. In some corners of the multiverse, she is what's known as a Planeswalker—a fiercely independent and extremely powerful entity not to be trifled with. Tumblestrum disapproves of the Hourglass Coven's cruelty and aims to deliver some much-needed comeuppance. The gnome sees the characters as agents of change who can undo some of the damage caused by the coven, and she suspects that if they do so, the characters will be on their way to becoming heroes worthy of epic ballads.

### Gondola Swans

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Enormous swans glide through the water here, pulling ornate wooden gondolas draped in flowers. The swans disappear into banks of silver mist as they wend their way down the river. A jetty extends ahead, at the end of which a waiting swan preens its feathers.
^0a4

Riding a gondola costs 1 ticket punch. Each ride is an hour long; it starts and ends at the jetty, and the gondola follows the river that marks the perimeter of the carnival.

Each gondola is pulled by a [giant swan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-swan-wbtw.md), which has the statistics of a [giant eagle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md) except that it has no talons, can attack twice with its beak as an action, and speaks Common and Auran. If the characters approach the swan at the end of the jetty, she bows her head, introduces herself as Feathereen, and explains that she can take the characters along the river that encircles the carnival. Each gondola holds up to eight Medium creatures.

Feathereen is erudite and haughty. She asks the characters several metaphysical questions as they travel, such as these:

- "What is joy?"  
- "How do I know you exist?"  
- "In worlds so full of magic, is time an illusion?"  

If the characters ignore Feathereen or make light of her questions, she rocks the gondola and tries to pitch her passengers into the water. Each occupant must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to stay inside the boat.

Characters who impress Feathereen with their answers earn her respect; if she is questioned about the carnival, her gossipy nature is revealed, and she imparts the following information:

- Feathereen saw the mime Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions") make a disastrous attempt to propose to the mermaid Palasha. "He was about to declare his love for the mermaid in front of everyone, when the words left him with a gasp! It was most unusual, and he hasn't spoken a word since. Palasha was very upset."  
- Feathereen enjoys late-night debates with the bugbear Burly (see "Staff Area" later in the chapter). "He has a profound mind and is simply wasted guarding the staff wagons. He misses his brother tremendously. No one knows what happened to Hurly, but everyone knows he never really fit in." (See area M5 in chapter 4 for Hurly's current whereabouts.)  

On the Story Tracker, note the names of any characters who impress Feathereen with their conversation. These characters gain debating talents that might prove useful in chapter 5 (see area P41).

#### Development

If the characters annoy Feathereen, she is irritable for the rest of the evening, and the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). If pleased, she remains in high spirits, which raises the carnival's mood by 1 step.

### Hall of Illusions

A glass cabinet stands near the entrance to this tent. If the characters approach it, read the following boxed text aloud. If they investigate the tent first, skip ahead to "Approaching the Hall of Illusions."

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A wooden mannequin of a grinning, raven-haired young woman in witch's attire and a green flowing cape hovers inside a glass cabinet. At the top of the cabinet, a sign reads "Tasha the Wizard—Known for Her Hideous Laughter."
> 
> A halfling couple holds hands as they approach the glass cabinet. One of the halflings is wearing butterfly face paint. As he drops to one knee and pulls a small box from his pocket, his sweetheart bursts into laughter and begins rolling on the ground. The halfling in face paint begins sobbing and darts into the nearby tent without getting his ticket punched.
^0a7

Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check recall that Tasha was one of the names reputedly used by [Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md), a legendary archmage. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of the mannequin must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a [Tasha's hideous laughter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md) spell. Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the creature can't be affected by the mannequin again.

The halfling in face paint is Rubin Sugarwood, and his halfling sweetheart is named Ween Sundapple; both are [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) (lawful good). Ween got too close to the glass cabinet and fell victim to its spell. If one or more characters follow Rubin into the Hall of Illusions, see "Chasing Rubin" below.

After recovering from the cabinet's spell, Ween remains outside the tent and calls out for Rubin, hoping he will return.

#### Approaching the Hall of Illusions

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This large tent is painted with a mural of shifting images that show grinning faeries diving into pools of color. The helical stripes of the tent's pointed canopies rotate in spirals, and the whole display seems designed to befuddle onlookers. A clown dressed in muted garb stands at the tent's entrance, blinking at you.
^0a9

Entering the tent costs 1 ticket punch.

The veil between the Material Plane and the Feywild is thinnest inside this hall of magical mirrors, and the door to Prismeer lies deep within. The Hourglass Coven's thieves slip in and out of the tent as they desire, and most of the carnival staff prefer to give the attraction a wide berth, believing it to be jinxed or haunted.

#### Candlefoot the Mime

![Candlefoot](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/021-01-006-candlefoot.webp#center)

Candlefoot, a [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (neutral good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter), is the reluctant ticket-puncher at the Hall of Illusions, and he does all he can to avoid entering the hall. All the color has leached out of his skin, hair, eyes, and apparel, giving him a strangely monochromatic look. And his problems don't end there.

A kenku named Kettlesteam stole Candlefoot's voice, so he communicates through mime. If the characters give him a writing implement and some parchment, he can also write out his thoughts.

Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Candlefoot.

##### A Fey Romance

When the mermaid Palasha (see "Silversong Lake" later in the chapter) joined the Witchlight Carnival, Candlefoot discovered that her songs had the power to bring back his coloration. (The change lasts only as long as he can hear her sing.) This surprised them both, and when the pair met, they fell in love. Recently, Candlefoot was about to propose to Palasha when his voice was snatched by Kettlesteam. If questioned, Candlefoot tries to explain his sorry circumstances through mime and asks the characters to help him recover his voice from Kettlesteam so he can go through with his proposal.

Here's a fantastic opportunity for you to explore your hidden talents as a mime. To indicate that he has lost his voice, Candlefoot might move his lips, then shake his head while holding a hand up to one ear. He might bob his head and flap his arms like a bird to indicate that Kettlesteam is the culprit. He doesn't know where the kenku is, but he knows she has been causing mischief throughout the carnival and sometimes uses magic to conceal her true form.

If the characters agree to help Candlefoot, he performs a few delightful magic tricks for their amusement using his [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md) cantrip, which he can cast without the verbal component.

#### Inside the Hall of Illusions

Tall mirrors line the interior walls of the tent. The mirrors near the entrance reflect onlookers in their youth; the images grow steadily older, until the mirrors deep within the hall reflect onlookers in their twilight years. As the characters scrutinize their reflections, ask the players to describe what their characters looked like as children and what they might look like in old age.

When the correct incantation is spoken aloud in front of any of the hall's mirrors, the mirror transforms into a portal to the Feywild domain of Prismeer (see "Through the Looking Glass" at the end of the chapter for more information).

#### Chasing Rubin

If the characters chase after Rubin when he enters the hall, Candlefoot looks shocked but doesn't follow them inside.

Any character who spends 1 minute searching for Rubin finds him with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. The halfling is gazing worriedly into a mirror, and a little girl in a pig mask can be seen in the pane, whispering to the halfling's youthful reflection. As soon as she sees the characters, the girl turns and disappears. This figure is Sowpig (see "Thieves of the Coven" earlier in the chapter), who is trying to lure the halfling to Thither so that [Skabatha Nightshade](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) can tempt him into a nefarious bargain. Rubin reveals that girl in the pig mask asked him if he had any regrets, and said that if he did, she knew someone who could help him—he just had to follow her.

If the characters fail to find Rubin after 3 minutes, they come upon him as he steps into the mirror to join the girl in the pig mask. After he passes through the pane, his youthful reflection takes the girl's hand and walks away with her. The ring he intended for his sweetheart drops to the floor inside the hall as he disappears. Characters who try to follow Rubin are unable to pass through the mirror as he did.

#### Development

On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of any characters who succeeded on the Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check to know that Tasha and Iggwilv are one and the same, because this information proves useful in chapter 5. Also note if Rubin was led away by Sowpig, as the characters might encounter him again in chapter 3 (see area L13).

If the characters reunite the halfling couple, Ween accepts Rubin's proposal, and the carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). If Rubin and Ween are not reunited, the mood of the carnival lowers by 1 step as word of Rubin's disappearance spreads.

### Lost Property

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Outside the lost property wagon is a large feline creature with midnight-blue fur. It has a pair of tentacles extending from its shoulders and wears fake butterfly wings. Hanging from its collar is a small wooden keg. The creature roughhouses with two young boys. One boy squeals, "Again, Dirla, again!" while the other hangs onto the creature's neck.
^0b1

Dirlagraun is a gray-whiskered [displacer beast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) that looks after stray children until they can be reunited with their parents. The keg fastened to its collar is filled with toffee apple juice and fitted with a spigot for easy pouring. The juice never fails to console an upset child.

When the characters arrive, the displacer beast is minding two boys named Viro and Allowin while their mother fetches food and drink. The displacer beast is unusual both in disposition and in its ability to speak Elvish and Sylvan. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Dirlagraun.

#### Missing Child

![Dirlagraun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/022-01-007-dirlagraun.webp#center)

If the characters question Dirlagraun, it quietly cautions them that some things go missing from the Witchlight Carnival and never come back. Before it can say more, Viro, the older of the two boys, picks up a mirrored ball from the lost property wagon. In a rare moment of anger, Dirlagraun snatches the ball back with a snarl and a flick of its tentacle, causing Viro to dash away in fright.

Unable to leave the younger boy, Allowin, alone, Dirlagraun pleads with the characters to go after Viro. Any character who searches for Viro can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, locating him in a nearby candy stall on a success. If Viro isn't found, a character can repeat the check after continuing the search for another 10 minutes. If Viro is not found within the hour, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters return with Viro, Dirlagraun is grateful and reveals that, many years ago, its own cub vanished from the carnival without a trace. The cub's name is Star, and all Dirlagraun has to remember Star by is its favorite toy—the small, mirrored ball that Viro grabbed. If one or more characters declare their intention to search for Star, Dirlagraun gives the mirrored ball to them.

Unknown to anyone who works at the carnival, Star followed Sowpig (see "Thieves of the Coven" earlier in the chapter) through a mirrored portal in the Hall of Illusions. The characters might encounter Star in chapter 3 (see "Little Oak").

#### Troubling Times

Dirlagraun is concerned that [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) are on edge. If the characters are willing to investigate, Dirlagraun advises against confronting the carnival owners directly. Instead, the displacer beast suggests that the characters sneak into the Staff Area behind the Big Top and spy on them.

### Mystery Mine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Propelled by magic, mine carts laden with fairgoers trundle into an opening carved like a dragon's mouth. The carts reappear moments later on the far side of the attraction, with the passengers expressing a mixture of bewilderment, fear, and excitement.
> 
> Near the entrance, a male dwarf dressed like a wizard shouts, "Unlock the mysteries of your mind in the Mystery Mine!" He has bushy eyebrows, wears a pointy hat, and holds a large clockwork contraption shaped like a giant eye.
^0b5

This ride costs 1 ticket punch.

The mine is the brainchild of an eccentric dwarf named Zephixo—the same individual standing outside it. He uses the [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) stat block, with the following changes:

- Zephixo (chaotic good) speaks Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, and Sylvan.  
- He has [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison.  

Zephixo beckons visitors toward his "All-Seeing Eye" contraption. If the characters look into the eye, ask each player to write down their character's name alongside the name of a creature the character fears. Collect their notes and refer to them during the ride. Characters who don't gaze into the All-Seeing Eye can still enter the mine, at the cost of having a much less exhilarating experience.

#### Riding the Mystery Mine

Each mine cart holds up to eight Medium creatures. As the characters pass through the dragon's mouth, the ride plunges them into an illusion-filled demiplane of undulating hills, corkscrewing trees, and prismatic skies.

As the characters' cart hurtles along the track, refer to the players' notes. Illusory forms of the characters' worst fears launch themselves at the mine cart, and it's up to you to describe how these fears manifest. The number of illusory forms equals the number of riders in the cart, and each character is confronted only once by their worst fear.

Each of the cart's riders must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw as each illusion appears. If the illusion a character faces is their own fear, they have disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a character is compelled to scream as the illusion terrifies them to the core; on a successful save, the character laughs at the illusion as it rushes by harmlessly. Ask the players to keep track of how many of these saving throws their characters fail.

Any character who succeeds on all the saving throws gains advantage on all Charisma-based ability checks made at the carnival. This effect lasts until the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch (see "Timed Events" toward the end of the chapter).

Any character who fails three or more of the ride's saving throws is haunted by nightmares for `1d8` days. Until the nightmares end, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw after finishing a long rest or gain `1d3` levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). On the Story Tracker, record the character's name and the number of days remaining until the nightmares cease, reducing that number by 1 after each long rest. Any spell that ends a curse rids the character of these nightmares but doesn't remove levels of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) gained as a result of them.

### Pixie Kingdom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A copse of oak trees shelters a miniaturized fairground. At its heart, a hamster runs inside a tiny Ferris wheel, encircled by minuscule wagons and candy stalls. A pixie sits cross-legged in the hollow of a tree at the entrance to this realm.
^0b8

The [pixie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) introduces himself as Jeremy Plum and does his best to persuade the characters that the Pixie Kingdom is the best attraction the carnival has to offer. Entry to the attraction costs 1 ticket punch.

Jeremy encourages the characters to adopt pixie names before entering; refer to the table below for ideas. The carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) if all the characters use their adopted pixie names while in the attraction.

#### Pixie Names

`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^name)`

| dice: d8 | Name |
|----------|------|
| 1 | Brightmite |
| 2 | Cobweb |
| 3 | Cotton Candy |
| 4 | Dimple |
| 5 | Jellybean Starfish |
| 6 | Panache |
| 7 | Puddlemud |
| 8 | Toadhop |
^name

Whether or not the characters agree to adopt their pixie names, Jeremy sprinkles [pixie dust](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pixie-dust-wbtw.md) (see appendix A) on them. Jeremy also presents each character with a potion that, when consumed within the boundary of the Pixie Kingdom, reduces the imbiber's size to Tiny for 1 hour, or until the imbiber wants the effect to end. Until the effect ends, the Tiny character has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the character's weapons deal `2d4` less damage (this change can't reduce the damage below 1).

#### Exploring the Kingdom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Pixie Kingdom is a tranquil oasis compared to the rest of the bustling carnival. The air is filled with the aroma of blackberry wine and flower blossoms. Eight brightly painted doorways are nestled in the bark at the bases of the surrounding trees.
^0bb

Twelve [pixies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) reside here during carnival hours. They are friendly, curious, and eager to ask new arrivals all sorts of questions. The characters are free to explore the kingdom and experience the following wonders:

- One character at a time can ride Pinecone, an excitable pug that listens only to pixies.  
- The kingdom's centerpiece is a pixie palace made entirely of old cocoon husks beautifully woven together.  
- Characters can dine on cucamelon sandwiches and thimbleberry tarts inside one of the pixie cottages.  
- Characters can ride the wheel, which is powered by a talkative hamster named Biscuit. An [awaken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/awaken.md) spell cast on the hamster gives it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common.  

Characters who spend time talking to the pixies or Biscuit learn the following rumors:

- "Everyone's on the lookout for a kenku troublemaker, but she's using magic to disguise herself."  
- "Candlefoot the mime and Palasha the mermaid are in love. On top of that, Candlefoot's lost his voice. Is that part of his act?"  
- "Burly the bugbear often talks philosophy with one of the gondola swans. That bugbear has brains as well as brawn."  

#### Playing Hide-and-seek

After a short while, the characters are invited to play a game of hide-and-seek, organized by two [pixies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md): the game's friendly supervisor, Honeymint, and a seeker named Starbug. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of any characters who play hide-and-seek with the pixies; this experience might prove useful in chapter 3 (see area L5).

Each character who plays the game makes a Wisdom ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to hide (see the "Player's Handbook" for rules on skills with different abilities). Starbug finds the character who has the lowest check result, at which point all the remaining characters move to new hiding places and make another check. The game continues until only one character remains hidden; this character is declared the winner and is awarded a packet of [pixie dust](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pixie-dust-wbtw.md) (see appendix A), with two leaves as the propeller blades. No character can win this prize more than once.

The characters can hide anywhere in the Pixie Kingdom, but Honeymint points out the following hiding spots before the game begins:

- **Biscuit's Wheel.** This wooden wheel has eight wicker carriages. Biscuit, the hamster who trundles around inside the contraption that turns the wheel, is very talkative. Offering food to the hamster is one way to keep him quiet.  
- **Flower Bed.** This area is home to several talking wildflowers. They're rather conceited and bicker over which of them has the silkiest petals and the finest aroma. Flattery can silence their bickering.  
- **Heron's Nest.** An awakened heron named Beatrice, who enjoys talking about the weather, roosts in a clump of long grasses and might allow characters to hide in her nest if they ask nicely.  

Any character who tries to hide in one of these locations must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to shush the creatures there. Success grants advantage on Wisdom ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in that location.

### Silversong Lake

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Mist gathers at the banks of a shimmering lake. Near its center, a mermaid lounges in a giant bowl, singing a glorious, haunting song that captivates spectators on the lakeshore. In response, the lake water coalesces into magical sculptures that whirl around her as she performs.
^0be

![Palasha](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/023-01-008-palasha.webp#center)

It costs nothing to visit the lake and behold its star attraction: the [merfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/merfolk.md) Palasha (chaotic good). Audiences crowd the lakeside just to witness her beauty and hear her song.

Palasha is no ordinary mermaid. Her singing has the ability to emulate the effects of a [control water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-water.md) spell. Once per day, as an action, she can also summon a [swarm of Quippers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md) that obeys her commands until it disappears after 1 minute.

Palasha is in love with Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions") but finds it tragic that he has lost his voice. She can't face seeing him after his very public marriage proposal went awry. The mermaid is also fiercely devoted to the carnival. "We are an impossibility in an impossible universe," she tells colleagues and strangers alike, with great pride. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Palasha.

#### Feathered Heckler

This event occurs the first time the characters watch Palasha perform. Kettlesteam, the kenku warlock, snakes through the crowd, using [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) and Mimicry to pose as different hecklers. After three mean-spirited jeers, the mermaid falters in mid-song, leaps out of her bowl, and darts off, heading downriver. Her abrupt departure causes the carnival's mood to lower by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

![Guess the Number of Feathers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/024-01-009-guess-the-number-of-feathers.webp#center)

Characters who try to identify the hecklers can spot Kettlesteam in her current guise with a successful Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check contested by the kenku's Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. See "Catching Kettlesteam" later in the chapter if the characters try to corner her.

#### Helping Palasha

If she is driven from Silversong Lake by heckling, Palasha takes refuge in the river near the Hall of Illusions. To coax her back to the lake, the characters must perform an act of gallantry, such as helping Candlefoot find his lost voice.

If the characters persuade Palasha to return to the lake and resume her performance, the carnival's mood rises by 2 steps (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). Palasha offers a singing lesson to any characters who helped her. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of characters who received a singing lesson from the mermaid. Their talent might benefit them in chapter 3 (see "Uncorrupted Fairy Rings").

### Small Stalls

![Catch the Dragon by the Tail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/025-01-010-catch-the-dragon-by-the-tail.webp#center)

The fair boasts several small stalls, each run by a [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (variable alignments; see the stat block earlier in the chapter). Some of the stalls sell sweet snacks and drinks. For 1 ticket punch, a customer can buy a snack served on a large flower petal or a beverage served in a fist-sized snail shell. The offerings include:

- Blue-frosted cupcake  
- Candied apple on a stick  
- Euphoreo cookie (saucer-sized cookies dusted with particles of faerie dragon euphoria gas)  
- Eveningberry wine (a sweet, nonalcoholic drink)  
- Faerie bell nectar (harvested from faerie bell flowers)  
- Pixie tarts (powdered candy in little cups)  
- Sugar-glazed button mushrooms  
- Tree sap lollipop  

The remaining stalls offer games and contests that cost 1 ticket punch apiece. A handful of games are summarized in the Carnival Games table and described below, and you can create others as you see fit using these as models.

**Carnival Games**

| Game | Key Ability |
|------|-------------|
| Almiraj Ring Toss | Dexterity |
| Catch the Dragon by the Tail | Wisdom |
| Gnome Poetry Contest | Charisma |
| Goblin Wrestling | Strength |
| Guess the Number of Feathers | Intelligence |
| Outstare the Cyclops | Constitution |
^carnival-games

If a character wins a prize playing a game, roll a `d8` on the Carnival Prizes table to determine the prize.

**Carnival Prizes**

`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^carnival-prizes)`

| dice: d8 | Prize |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Trinket (determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table in the introduction). |
| 2 | Wooden wand with 8 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges to cast the [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md) cantrip. This wand can't be recharged. |
| 3 | Packet of [pixie dust](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pixie-dust-wbtw.md) (see appendix A). |
| 4 | Bottle of Witchlight wine. While the bottle is uncorked, it plays calliope music until the bottle is emptied of wine. |
| 5 | Replica unicorn horn filled with candy. |
| 6 | Single application of magic face paint. As an action, you can apply the face paint to yourself or another creature. The recipient gains the benefit of a [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell that lasts for 1 hour or until the recipient chooses to end the effect. |
| 7 | Cuddly toy spider. As an action, you can stroke the spider to gain the benefit of a [spider climb](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spider-climb.md) spell that lasts for 1 hour. Once used, the toy turns into a real spider and crawls away. |
| 8 | Glove puppet in the shape of a wizard. As an action, you can move the puppet's arms to cast the [minor illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md) cantrip. After three uses, the puppet disappears in a puff of smoke. |
^carnival-prizes

![Almiraj Ring Toss](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/026-01-011-almiraj-ring-toss.webp#center)

#### Almiraj Ring Toss

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "This almiraj is no mirage. Adorn its horn with two or three rings to win a prize!"
^0c3

This game involves tossing rings over the horn of a wooden statuette of an almiraj (a cute, bunny-like creature with a horn like a unicorn's). The almiraj teleports around on a tabletop, making it hard to score a success. A participant gets three rings. Tossing a ring over the almiraj's horn requires a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. Two successful tosses earn one roll on the Carnival Prizes table; three successes earn two rolls on the table.

#### Catch the Dragon by the Tail

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Prizes! Prizes! Prizes! Catch the faerie dragon by the tail and win a piece of its hoard!"
^0c5

While blindfolded and standing in a booth, a participant must grab the tail of an elusive, giggling [red faerie dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-red.md) that flutters around them. The participant has three chances to succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Someone who succeeds on the check catches the dragon by the tail and rolls once on the Carnival Prizes table, or twice if the successful check occurs on the first attempt.

#### Gnome Poetry Contest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Sound the chime, it's time to rhyme! You bring the poem! We'll bring the gno-em!"
^0c7

![Gnome Poetry Contest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/027-01-012-gnome-poetry-contest.webp#center)

A participant must outperform a gnome in a best-of-five poetry contest. Doing so requires three successful DC 15 Charisma ([Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) checks in five or fewer attempts. Someone who wins the contest rolls once on the Carnival Prizes table, or twice if they succeeded three times without failing a check.

#### Goblin Wrestling

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Strong folks! Test your mettle in a goblin wrestle!"
^0c9

A Small participant has to pin an unarmed [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) (lawful good), while a Medium participant has to pin one goblin while wrestling two of them. Winning the game requires a successful Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check contested by the goblin; two goblins working together make one check with advantage. Resolve a tie by rerolling. A victorious participant earns one roll on the Carnival Prizes table.

#### Guess the Number of Feathers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Birds of a feather? How about feathers of a bird? Step right up and guess how many feathers festoon this fiendish fowl!"
^0cb

A participant gets three tries to guess the number of feathers on one of a group of caged [cockatrices](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/cockatrice.md). Someone who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence check guesses correctly and earns one roll on the Carnival Prizes table, or two rolls if the successful check occurs on the first attempt.

#### Outstare the Cyclops

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "What do you do when the eye of the cyclops falls upon you? You stare right back if you've got the stamina!"
^0cd

Winning this game requires a participant to outstare an illusory cyclops. Whoever blinks first loses. To win the game, the contestant must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution check. Someone who wins the game receives a prize, determined by rolling once on the Carnival Prizes table.

![Outstare the Cyclops](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/028-01-013-outstare-the-cyclops.webp#center)

### Snail Racing

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The grandstands next to this racecourse are filled with cheering fairgoers ringing bells, swinging rattles, and waving flags. On the starting line, eight giant snails are having their shells scrubbed by pixies.
> 
> Above the circular course, a wooden gantry hangs from the branches of a central tree, where two goblins officiate the proceedings.
^0cf

Snail racing is a highly competitive, fast-paced sport that draws a lively crowd. Characters can participate in the race as snail jockeys, but it costs 1 ticket punch to enter. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of any characters who take part in the snail racing, as the experience might prove useful in chapter 2 (see "Reaching the Bottom").

If at least half the characters participate in a snail race, the carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). If anyone breaks the rules, the mood lowers by 1 step.

#### Snails and Pixies

Each of the eight [giant snails](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-snail-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) is assigned a crew of three [pixies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) to prepare it for a race. The snails are unusually fast, wear colored caparisons, and have numbered saddles strapped to their shells. Their racing numbers, names, and team colors are given in the Giant Snails table.

**Giant Snails**

| Number | Name | Team Color |
|--------|------|------------|
| 1 | Shellymoo | Pink |
| 2 | Nimblefoot | Blue |
| 3 | High Road | Purple |
| 4 | Quickleaf | Green |
| 5 | Flowerflash | Yellow |
| 6 | Whizzy | Orange |
| 7 | Breakneck | Red |
| 8 | Queen's Majesty | Black |
^giant-snails

![The giant snail race is on...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/029-01-014-snail-racing.webp#center "The giant snail race is one of the carnival's most popular attractions.")

#### Snail Racing Rules

Every snail needs a jockey, and any saddles not filled by characters are filled by other attendees (use the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block to represent these NPCs). All the snails and their riders begin at the start line; fireworks signal the start of the race, after which the riders race their snails to the finish line.

On a whiteboard or notepad, jot down the giant snails, their numbers, and their riders. Next to the names, keep a running total of how far each snail travels in feet during the race. The course is 480 feet long.

##### Racing Rules

The race is divided into 6-second rounds. Once the race begins, the snails move along the track at remarkable speed, each one covering 80 feet per round by itself. Without riders, the snails are an even match, but a jockey can try to improve a snail's performance by patting its shell or speaking words of encouragement at it.

Initiative rolls are unnecessary. Once per round, each jockey can make a DC 12 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. On a successful check, the jockey's snail moves an extra 10 feet that round, or 20 feet if the check succeeds by 5 or more. On a failed check, the jockey's snail moves 10 feet slower that round, or 20 feet slower if the check fails by 5 or more. The race ends when one or more snails travel the 480 feet needed to cross the finish line.

If two or more snails cross the finish line in the same round, determine the winner of the race by having those snails' jockeys each roll a `d20`. The highest roll determines the winner, with one snail narrowly claiming victory. If the roll for first place is tied, the race ends in a tie, and each winning jockey receives the first-place prize (see "Prizes" below).

Signs posted in the stands and along the racetrack warn that neither jockeys nor spectators may influence the outcome of a race by using magic or by harming other jockeys or snails. Any jockey who openly does so is disqualified, as is the jockey's snail. A spectator caught doing so is escorted from the carnival by `1d4` [goblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) (lawful good) who are watching the crowd closely for troublemakers.

##### Surprises

At the start of each round after the first, roll a `d8` and consult the Snail Race Surprises table to determine if something unexpected happens that round. When a surprise occurs, determine which snail is affected by rolling a `d8`.

**Snail Race Surprises**

`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^snail-race-surprises)`

| dice: d8 | Surprise |
|----------|----------|
| 1–3 | No surprise. |
| 4 | One random snail gets a stitch, reducing its speed by 40 feet this round. |
| 5 | A spectator throws a head of lettuce at one random snail. The snail stops to eat the lettuce and doesn't move at all this round. |
| 6–7 | One random snail is bolstered by the cheering crowd and moves an extra 20 feet this round. |
| 8 | The saddle on one random snail comes loose and falls off. The snail's jockey must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to remain atop the snail. On a failed save, the jockey falls off, and the snail continues the race on its own. |
^snail-race-surprises

##### Prizes

The jockey whose snail wins the race receives a [potion of advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-advantage-wbtw.md) (see appendix A). The jockey whose snail comes in last receives a consolation prize, provided they weren't disqualified. The consolation prize is a magic wand that allows its holder to cast the [dancing lights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md) cantrip once. Once used to cast this spell, the wand turns into a tulip.

### Staff Area

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A tangled wall of thorns surrounds a cluster of wagons lit by lanterns. This caravan is barely visible through the thicket.
^0d6

The carnival's wagons are located behind the Big Top, protected by a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-thick wall of thorns. When a member of the carnival staff stands within 1 foot of the wall, the thorns part to form an 8-foot-high, 4-foot-wide doorway in front of the staff member. This door remains open for 10 seconds, then disappears as thorny vines fill the opening once more. The wall is magical and also impervious to damage. The wall grants three-quarters cover to creatures behind it.

A creature can move through the wall of thorns, albeit slowly and painfully. It costs 8 feet of movement to move through 1 foot of the wall. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (`1d8`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Whenever a creature ends its turn in the wall, trumpet-shaped flowers burst from the brambles nearby and honk an alarm that is audible up to 50 feet away.

#### Circle of Wagons

Enclosed by the wall of thorns is a circle of eight brightly painted wagons, one of which is a glass-enclosed water tank for Palasha the mermaid. The fanciest of the remaining seven wagons belongs to [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md).

![Burly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/030-01-015-burly.webp#center)

The perimeter inside the wall of thorns and outside the circle of wagons is patrolled by a [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) named Burly (neutral good), who leaves his post once during the evening to participate in the Big Top Extravaganza (see "Timed Events" later in the chapter). While on patrol, Burly wears a large jack-o'-lantern on his head, as one would wear a helmet, in addition to his dungarees and fake fairy wings.

The central area enclosed by the wagons is guarded by Thaco the clown, a human [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (chaotic neutral; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) who is loyal only to [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md). He usually sits right outside the door to Witch and Light's wagon, blowing bubbles with his bubble pipe.

Burly and Thaco dislike each other, so they don't fraternize while on guard duty. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for them.

Characters caught snooping around the wagons without an escort are evicted from the carnival and must find a way to sneak or barter their way back in.

#### Witch and Light's Wagon

[Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) (see their stat blocks earlier in the chapter) are in their wagon throughout the evening, except during the Big Top Extravaganza (which Light attends and Witch does not) and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch (which they both attend). See "Timed Events" later in the chapter for more information.

Refer to the "Carnival Owners" section for more information about Witch and Light. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for the pair.

Characters who sneak up to the wagon while it's occupied can overhear Witch and Light talking:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two contrasting voices emanate from the wagon.
> 
> *Mister Witch, in a low and gravelly voice:* "You need to find a way to calm down."
> 
> *Mister Light, in a high-pitched, shrill voice:* "I'll calm down when that kenku pest is gone."
> 
> *Witch*: "She knows nothing. She'll get frustrated soon enough and be on her way."
> 
> *Light*: "I hope you're right."
> 
> *Witch*: "Trust me."
^0d9

From there, the conversation shifts to the current mood of the carnival and ideas for new carnival acts or attractions ("The catoblepas didn't work out, but maybe we can buy a giraffe and paint it blue. Or we could teach Northwind how to play the fiddle.") Then it turns to the mysterious disappearance of Burly's unruly brother, Hurly (in hushed tones that suggest Witch or Light might have had a hand in it, although neither admits any involvement). Hurly's fate is revealed in chapter 4 (see area M5).

![Thaco](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/031-01-016-thaco.webp#center)

If the characters disturb Witch and Light in their wagon without being invited, jump ahead to the "Meeting Witch and Light" encounter described later in the chapter, skipping over the lead-in with Burly and Thaco.

##### Searching the Wagon

[Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s bunk is neat and unadorned. [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md)'s bunk is gaudy and messy, with costumes strewn everywhere. Characters who search through the gear find a hatbox containing the crown of the Witchlight Monarch; this splendid crown of gold butterflies teleports back to its hatbox at the end of each evening and is ceremoniously produced from its box during the monarch's coronation (see "Timed Events" later in the chapter).

Any character who searches the wagon for secret compartments finds one with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. The compartment is located in a bench and contains a tiny, bejeweled chest worth 50 gp. This chest is a replica of a much larger chest hidden on the Ethereal Plane (with the help of a [Leomund's secret chest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/leomunds-secret-chest.md) spell). While holding the replica chest, [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) can use an action to summon the larger chest. He can send the larger chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.

##### Treasure

The chest hidden on the Ethereal Plane (which is worth 5,000 gp) contains recent earnings (210 sp and 70 gp), a [potion of diminution](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-diminution.md), a [potion of growth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-growth.md), and a [potion of advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-advantage-wbtw.md) (see appendix A). The potions are not labeled, but [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) knows which is which.

## Carnival Events

This section describes special events that occur during the characters' visit to the carnival.

### Meeting Witch and Light

The characters receive an invitation to meet privately with [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) when the carnival's mood reaches either end of the track (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) or if the characters impress [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) during the Big Top Extravaganza (see "Timed Events" later in the chapter).

Witch and Light send Burly the [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) (neutral good) to fetch the characters:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A bugbear wearing dungarees, fairy wings, and a helmet made from a jack-o'-lantern approaches you. "Follow me," he growls. "Management wants to see you."
^0de

With a wave of his hand, Burly creates an opening in the wall of thorns that surrounds the staff wagons (see "Staff Area" above) and leads the characters through it. If questioned about the nature of the meeting, Burly insists there's nothing to worry about. If the carnival's mood is good, he adds that his bosses are in high spirits. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Burly.

If the characters follow Burly, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The bugbear leads you to a circle of wagons. Leaning against a particularly ostentatious wagon is an aging clown with a painted grin. He puffs on a bubble pipe and glares at you as the bugbear, ignoring the clown, opens the wagon's door and ushers you inside.
^0df

The clown is Thaco, a human [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (chaotic neutral; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) and over-the-hill carnival attraction. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Thaco.

![Mister Witch and Mister Li...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/032-01-017-witch-and-light.webp#center "Mister Witch and Mister Light don't like strangers eavesdropping on their private conversations")

#### Inside the Wagon

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A flamboyant elf grins from ear to ear as he welcomes you into the wagon with a theatrical bow. "Please come in, it's a delight to meet you all! I am [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md), and this is my associate, [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)."
> 
> He gestures to a stocky elf lounging on a bunk. [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) nods to you and doffs his top hat.
^0e1

Stat blocks for [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) appear earlier in the chapter.

[Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) gestures toward his scepter—the [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md)—and explains that it picks up every nuance of emotion in the carnival. If the carnival's mood is good, Light expresses his gratitude for the cheer that the characters have brought to the carnival so far. If the carnival's mood is bad, he expresses his regret that the characters aren't having a delightful time and notes that, in turn, they're spoiling everyone's evening.

Witch and Light are eager to learn the characters' reasons for visiting the carnival; if the characters are motivated by the "Lost Things" adventure hook, Witch and Light dimly remember the characters from when they visited the carnival as children.

If the characters attack the carnival owners, they're swiftly restrained by Burly and Thaco, who try to knock them out and dump them outside the carnival. Characters who overcome the carnival owners and their guards are begrudgingly taught the secret incantation to reach Prismeer (see "Through the Looking Glass" at the end of the chapter).

#### Questioning Witch and Light

If the characters have come to the carnival seeking lost things, Witch and Light express their regret but make it clear that they're not responsible for those losses, claiming "forces are at work on the other side that are entirely beyond our control." [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) adds, "The wheel of time turns ever on... what's lost is lost, what's gone is gone."

If they are questioned about conversations that were overheard (see "Witch and Light's Wagon" above and "Catching Kettlesteam" below), Witch and Light admit they're not the carnival's original owners and took over management through an honest pact with the owner of another carnival.

If asked about Kettlesteam, Witch and Light say she's "a disgruntled guest and troublemaker whose fey patron, Zybilna, dwells in the Feywild domain of Prismeer." They add that Zybilna is also the patron of the Witchlight Carnival, but Witch and Light have had no contact with her for some time. Throughout the conversation, Witch and Light never mention the Hourglass Coven.

#### Meeting's End

To end the meeting, [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) takes a quick look at his [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md), then nods to Burly to escort the characters from the wagon. If the carnival's mood is good, [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) offers each character a gift as they exit: a balloon animal of their choosing, crafted by Thaco, "a clown of few words but many talents." Thaco fashions each balloon into whatever creature is asked for. Each balloon animal is tied with a ribbon and floats magically in the air.

### Burly's Plan

Following the characters' meeting with Witch and Light, Burly pulls the characters aside for a hushed conversation:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Burly removes his jack-o'-lantern helmet, revealing a worried expression. "Bad things have been happening at the carnival for a while. People and things have been going missing. My bosses know more than they're telling, but their hands are tied somehow. You're the first people I've met who might be able to set things right. Witch and Light are good guys, but you'll need leverage to make them spill the beans."
^0e5

Burly suggests the characters purloin [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md) (without which the carnival can't stay on schedule) and use it to compel Witch and Light to provide the answers they seek. He proposes that the best time to swipe the watch is during the Big Top Extravaganza, since it's the only time when Witch and Light are separated. Although he doesn't condone theft, Burly has talked himself into believing that it's not really stealing if the characters give back the watch. Burly offers to assist where he can, but he doesn't want Witch and Light to know that he plotted against them, because it would cost him his job and his home. He also warns that he'll see no harm come to his bosses; they might be flawed, but without them, the carnival will fall apart.

Over the course of the conversation, Burly shares the following additional pieces of information:

- "The Witchlight Monarch is chosen by [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md). Witch and Light have no control over who the monarch will be, but it's always the guest who has contributed the most to the happiness of the carnival. The monarch is also given a charm that lets them fly."  
- "[Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md) is attached to his waistcoat by a chain, so whoever tries to steal it needs something to break or unfasten the chain."  
- "Dirlagraun, Candlefoot, and Palasha might help you—they're good eggs. But stay away from Thaco—he's untrustworthy."  

If the characters suggest stealing the [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md) instead of the [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md), Burly asserts that the watch is easier to steal because it's smaller and often tucked in [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s pocket, whereas [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) is rarely seen without the vane in hand. Burly concedes, however, that the vane yields almost as much leverage in negotiations with Witch and Light, though he has no plan for stealing the vane.

#### The Heist

See "Timed Events" later in the chapter for details of the coronation. It's up to the characters to come up with a plan to get close enough to [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) to steal his pocket watch. Any allies they've gained go along with their schemes but won't harm the carnival owners or other members of the carnival staff.

[Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) keeps the watch in his waistcoat pocket, fastened to the garment with a chain. As an action, a character can attempt to steal the timepiece with a DC 13 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. This check is made with advantage if Witch is distracted during the attempt. A character needs thieves' tools, a dagger, or a pair of scissors to snip or detach the chain securing the watch.

If the characters rob [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) of his timepiece, he and Light are desperate to get it back. They'd prefer not to cause a scene in front of the guests and promise to show the characters the way to Prismeer once the watch is returned. Witch and Light are true to their word (see "Through the Looking Glass" at the end of the chapter).

### Catching Kettlesteam

[Kettlesteam](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kettlesteam-the-kenku-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block) snoops around the carnival under the cover of a [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions" earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.

If Kettlesteam has not already been caught, a character who spends 1 hour searching for the disguised kenku can, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, see through her disguise while moving through crowds and paying close attention to suspicious-looking folks. If discovered, Kettlesteam tries to flee from the main thoroughfare, using tents and other carnival features to break line of sight to her. She's willing to cautiously parley with characters who claim they are investigating the carnival for their own reasons.

Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Kettlesteam.

![Kettlesteam the Kenku](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/033-637677441694763205.webp#center)

#### Talking with Kettlesteam

If the characters corner her, Kettlesteam tells her story in the voice she stole from Candlefoot:

- Many years ago, she made a fey pact with Zybilna, the archfey who rules the Feywild domain of Prismeer. Recently, Kettlesteam has become convinced something is amiss with her patron. As a warlock, she senses that Zybilna is no longer in touch with her—a very disconcerting thought!  
- Kettlesteam wants to question the carnival's owners about Prismeer, but they keep giving her the cold shoulder. She's sure they know more than they're letting on.  
- During her last visit, Kettlesteam overheard Witch and Light talking in their wagon. She repeats the conversation, using her Mimicry trait to imitate Light's agitated voice ("Someone is going to find out about this! They'll shut us down!") followed by Witch's calm yet firm reply ("We agreed to this pact. Our hands were forced but our eyes were open. We let the Hourglass Coven take what it wants, and in return, we stay in business. That is what you want, right?").  
- Kettlesteam is causing trouble in the carnival and refuses to stop until Witch and Light divulge what they know about Zybilna and Prismeer.  
- Due to the terms of her fey pact, Kettlesteam can't enter Prismeer. She urges the characters to find out what has happened to Zybilna.  

If one or more characters are working for Madryck (see the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook in the introduction) and the characters mention Madryck by name, the kenku ruffles her feathers and lets out a squawk, admitting that she and Madryck are rivals who happen to share the same patron (Zybilna). Each thinks the other is untrustworthy.

If questioned about the theft of Candlefoot's voice, Kettlesteam produces a corn husk doll with a thorny stem tied around its neck. The doll represents Candlefoot, and untying the stem restores the mime's lost voice. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince Kettlesteam to part with the doll.

#### Kettlesteam's Aid

Characters who befriend Kettlesteam earn a valuable ally in the carnival. She can offer advice, or even help the characters steal [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md)'s watch (see "Burly's Plan" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters miss the opportunity to meet with [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md), Kettlesteam comes up with a plan similar to Burly's: she encourages the characters to steal [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md) and use it as leverage to blackmail the carnival owners into showing them the way to Prismeer. How the characters acquire the vane is up to them, but Kettlesteam is happy to help.

#### Development

If the characters reunite Candlefoot with his voice, note this accomplishment on the Story Tracker. The grateful Candlefoot gives the characters an acting lesson at the earliest opportunity, giving them a talent that might prove useful in chapter 4 (see the "Fey Beacons" section).

Once he regains his voice, Candlefoot seeks out Palasha and proposes marriage to her. Reuniting the couple causes the carnival's mood to rise by 2 steps (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). From that point on, Palasha and Candlefoot treat the characters as trusted allies, which could prove useful during the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch, as they both have roles to play in the coronation.

### Timed Events

The following events occur at specific times throughout the evening.

#### Hour 1: Welcome Gifts

Shortly after the carnival opens for business, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A twelve-foot-tall walking tree garlanded in golden ribbons marches down the thoroughfare. Emerald clouds swirl above the tree and rain down golden, spinning sycamore seeds. Fairgoers try to catch the seeds before they hit the ground. As the seeds gently fall, a chatty squirrel scampers along the boughs of the tree, handing dandelions to select passersby.
^0ed

The tree is Northwind, a [treant sapling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-sapling-wbtw.md) (see its stat block earlier in the chapter), and the squirrel is its trusty companion, Red (see "Dragonfly Rides" earlier in the chapter). As Northwind encourages onlookers to catch the falling seeds before they touch the ground, Red hands the characters one dandelion apiece and encourages each of them to make a wish and then blow the dandelion's seeds into the air.

##### Sycamore Seeds

A creature can attempt to catch a falling sycamore seed before it touches the ground, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Any creature that catches a seed before it touches the ground receives a gift, determined by rolling a `d8` and consulting the Welcome Gifts table. A creature that receives one of these gifts can't gain another one for 24 hours.

##### Dandelion Seeds

A character can make a wish while blowing their dandelion's seeds into the air. The player should secretly write down their character's wish on a piece of paper; collect these notes and keep them somewhere safe. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of the characters who make wishes. These wishes become relevant in chapter 4 (see "Wish Stones" in the "Brigganock Mine" section).

**Welcome Gifts**

`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^welcome-gifts)`

| dice: d8 | Gift |
|----------|------|
| 1–3 | The creature gains the following personality trait until dawn: "I am easily amused." Any conflicting character trait is suppressed in the meantime. |
| 4 | The creature gains a die, a `d4`, which it can add to one ability check it makes before the next dawn. |
| 5–7 | The seed turns into a gold piece. |
| 8 | The creature gains a die, a `d8`, which it can add to one ability check it makes before the next dawn. |
^welcome-gifts

#### Hour 4: Big Top Extravaganza

Spectators file into the Big Top and fill the rows of seats. If the characters join them, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The lights dim and a hush falls over the crowd. A second later, a spotlight illuminates a lithe, elven figure sitting in a silver hoop, suspended above the center ring by silk ropes. The elf wears a dazzling suit of diamond-pane mirrors and a pair of butterfly wings. His scepter is topped with a spinning vane.
> 
> "Welcome, one and all, to this evening's extravaganza! I am [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md). Prepare to be delighted!"
^0f1

The extravaganza involves several of the carnival's star performers and attractions, with [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) serving as ringmaster. Over the course of an hour, Burly the bugbear performs feats of strength, Palasha the mermaid serenades the audience from a clamshell bathing pool, Candlefoot the mime plays silent games with audience members, and faerie dragons with bright streamers tied to their tails perform dazzling acts of synchronized flying as a troupe of acrobats, clowns, and fire-breathers parade about. If the characters attempt to disrupt the show, [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) deflects their interruptions with banter and maintains a jovial demeanor. Persistent heckling lowers the carnival's mood by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

Near the end of the show, [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) asks if any guests would like to perform their own acts for the crowd. Any character who accepts the offer can woo spectators with a DC 14 Charisma ([Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check, raising the carnival's mood by 1 step on a success. If multiple characters choose to perform together, make it a group check instead, but raise the carnival's mood by 3 steps if the group check succeeds. A character can improve the carnival's mood only once during this extravaganza.

At the end of the show, Burly invites any characters who took to the stage and impressed the crowd to meet with [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) (see "Meeting Witch and Light" earlier in the chapter).

#### Hour 8: Crowning the Witchlight Monarch

Most of the carnival's stars have a part to play in the coronation, which celebrates the joyous zeal of a single guest. The event plays out as follows:

- As spectators take their seats in the Big Top, Dirlagraun the displacer beast escorts [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) from his wagon to the coronation, leaving Thaco the clown behind to guard the Staff Area.  
- [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and Dirlagraun stand on the sidelines next to Candlefoot as [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) gives an opening speech and the monarch is selected (see "Selecting a Monarch" below). Candlefoot holds the hatbox containing the monarch's crown.  
- [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) removes the crown of golden butterflies from the hatbox and places it on the monarch's head; [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) knights the monarch with the [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md). Happy clowns shower all three in glitter.  
- Witch and Light escort the monarch on a circuit of the stage while Palasha the mermaid sings a joyous song and pixies flutter all around her.  
- When Palasha's song concludes, [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) leads the monarch on a parade through the carnival, with the other guests following as Burly the bugbear sets off fireworks. Meanwhile, Dirlagraun escorts [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) back to his wagon.  

##### Selecting a Monarch

[Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md) selects the monarch from the carnival's guests, spinning a thread of golden light that winds its way to the chosen reveler. If the mood of the carnival is positive, choose the character who improved the carnival's mood the most, or ask the players to agree on which of their characters should be crowned. If it's not appropriate for any of the characters to be crowned monarch, then a jubilant halfling bedecked in flowers is selected from the crowd. [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) exudes cheerfulness and follows through with the ceremony regardless of who is chosen.

At the end of the celebration, as the carnival begins to wind down, the ceremonial crown teleports back into its hatbox. Candlefoot returns the hatbox to the Staff Area, handing it off to Thaco the clown, who stashes it in the wagon belonging to [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md).

##### Tumblestrum's Intervention

If the characters haven't found a way to Prismeer by the end of the evening, Ellywick Tumblestrum (see "Feasting Orchard" earlier in the chapter) comes to their aid. The gnome bard appears next to the characters, exclaiming that it's "high time you folks were elsewhere," and leads them quickly to the Hall of Illusions. She ushers them inside and whispers the following incantation to them: "Hither, thither, here and there; wander yonder, show me where." Using the incantation, the characters can travel to Prismeer (see "Through the Looking Glass" below). If they are being chased, Tumblestrum distracts pursuers with a song before disappearing as mysteriously as she appeared.

#### Development

The Witchlight Monarch gains the following charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information) and instantly becomes aware of its benefits:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Charm of the Monarch.** You can sprout a pair of beautiful butterfly wings. As long as you have the wings, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you gain a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour. After you use this charm three times, it vanishes from you.
^0f6

If one of the characters becomes the Witchlight Monarch, note this fact on the Story Tracker. Even after the charm wears off, a character retains the title of Witchlight Monarch forever, and this title bears great weight in Prismeer. Fey creatures in the domain will not attack a Witchlight Monarch unless the monarch attacks them first. Moreover, Fey creatures in Prismeer treat a Witchlight Monarch with great reverence, addressing the character as "Your Majesty" or "Your Highness." The characters don't become aware of these benefits until they arrive in Prismeer and interact with its inhabitants.

![The Feywild awaits!](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/034-01-018-the-feywild-awaits.webp#center)

### Through the Looking Glass

If the characters gain leverage over [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md), either by stealing the [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md) or through some other scheme, the carnival owners lead them to the Hall of Illusions and march them inside:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As Witch and Light move through the Hall of Illusions, their reflections in the mirrors show them as gloomy shadar-kai children, with your own youthful reflections following behind. Soon, they call you to a halt. The mirrors now reflect everyone's true age.
> 
> [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) addresses you in a hushed tone. "Everything you seek and more lies beyond this mirror. If you mean to step through, then stand in front of the glass and repeat this rhyme: Hither, thither, here and there; wander yonder, show me where."
^0f9

Witch and Light won't mention the Hourglass Coven or the splintering of Prismeer, but they share the following information if pressed:

- The land beyond the mirrors is called Prismeer, wherein dwells the carnival's secret patron, the archfey Zybilna.  
- Anyone who sneaks into the carnival without a ticket is robbed of something precious. Whatever is stolen always finds its way to Prismeer.  
- The mirror is a one-way portal. Once they arrive in Prismeer, the characters must find their own way back to their world.  

#### Stepping Through

When a character recites Witch's rhyme while standing in front of their present-day reflection in the Hall of Illusions, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Mist swirls in the mirror, blotting out your reflection.
^0fb

Any creature that touches the surface of the misty mirror is pulled through it and deposited in Hither, one of Prismeer's three splinter-realms (described in chapter 2). If a character tries to take either the [Witchlight watch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-watch-wbtw.md) or the [Witchlight vane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/witchlight-vane-wbtw.md) through the mirror, the item drops to the floor as the character crosses the threshold. Neither item can be taken to Prismeer.

If [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) are both present, they wait until only one character remains and then impart the following information to that character:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> *Witch*: "Mind the Rule of Three: future, present, past."
> 
> *Light*: "Find the alicorn and free the dormant queen at last."
^0fc

Proceed with chapter 2 once the characters pass through the magic mirror.

# Into the Feywild
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, p. 4* 

This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing—perhaps a world of your own creation—then ventures into the Feywild. Also known as the Plane of Faerie, the Feywild is a place of wonder and whimsy ruled by unfettered emotion. Before running this adventure, please read the ""Feywild"" section in the "Dungeon Master's Guide", as it contains useful information about this dusky, fantastic plane of existence.

The information in this book is intended for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play through the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now!

## Adventure Summary

The main antagonists of this story are three hags who collectively form the Hourglass Coven, which is described in appendix B. These hags are the adoptive sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&D's past and a key player in the adventure's unfolding drama. Using an artifact called [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md), the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters' world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md), who can help or hinder the characters' efforts to reach Prismeer.

One of the many novelties of this adventure is that the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they're clever. They can fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won't always be in their favor.

### Adventure Structure

The characters are drawn into the adventure by one of two adventure hooks. You choose which hook to use. Both hooks are described in "Beginning the Adventure," later in this introduction.

Chapter 1 describes the Witchlight Carnival. Hidden somewhere in the carnival is a fey crossing to the domain of Prismeer, but the trick to opening this portal is known only to the carnival's shadar-kai owners, [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md).

Chapters 2, 3, and 4 describe the carved-up domain of Prismeer, which the hags of the Hourglass Coven have usurped and split into thirds. The characters can move between these splinter-realms only if they have the right fey guides to help them.

Chapter 5 describes the Palace of Heart's Desire, where the archfey Zybilna and her court are frozen in time by the magic of [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md). The palace is where the characters need to go if they hope to thwart the Hourglass Coven by freeing Zybilna or destroying the cauldron.

The book concludes with several appendices wherein you'll find rules for new magic items, stat blocks for new creatures, and other goodies. At the end of the book is a Story Tracker you can use to keep track of story developments as they occur. Advice on how to use the Story Tracker appears later in this introduction.

### Character Advancement

The adventure assumes that the characters start at 1st level. If your players are more interested in exploration and social interaction than combat, or if you want to make the characters' Feywild excursion less dangerous, have them start at 3rd level instead. Advancement is handled the same way regardless.

In this adventure, the characters receive experience points for achieving milestones rather than defeating monsters:

- **Entering a Hag's Realm.** Whenever the characters enter a hag's realm (Hither, Thither, or Yon) for the first time, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level. For example, when the characters leave the Witchlight Carnival and arrive in Hither for the first time, they gain a level.  
- **Encountering a Hag.** After the characters encounter a hag of the Hourglass Coven for the first time, everyone in the party who survives the encounter receives enough XP to advance 1 level.  
- **Freeing Zybilna.** If the characters free Zybilna from temporal stasis or destroy [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md), everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level.  

If you follow this method of character advancement, characters who start the adventure at 1st level might reach 8th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## Running the Adventure

To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks ("Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual").

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
^005

The "Monster Manual" contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in this adventure. When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you'd better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." If the stat block is not from the "Monster Manual", the adventure's text tells you where to find it.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the "Player's Handbook". Magic items are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" unless the adventure's text directs you to appendix A.

### Using the Maps

This book contains a fold-out, double-sided poster map and several interior maps. These elements are further described in the sections that follow.

#### Poster Map

The adventure lets you know when it's safe to show your players either side of the double-sided poster map.

One side of the poster map shows the Witchlight Carnival and a Time Tracker, to help you track the passage of time as the characters explore the carnival. Certain carnival events occur only when the Time Tracker reaches a certain point. Though it's not necessary, your group can place tokens or miniatures on the map to keep track of where the characters are in the carnival at any given time.

The reverse side of the poster map shows the Feywild domain of Prismeer, now divided into three splinter-realms called Hither, Thither, and Yon. Lodged between them is the Palace of Heart's Desire—the home of Prismeer's archfey ruler, Zybilna. This side of the map is meant to be shared with the players once the characters reach the palace, from where they can look out over the whole domain. DM-friendly versions of this map appear in chapters 2, 3, and 4, to help you track the party's progress through Prismeer's splinter-realms.

> [!note] Eight and Three
> 
> As you run *The Wild Beyond the Witchlight*, look for ways to bring the numbers eight and three to the fore. For example, characters who take a long rest in the fey domain of Prismeer might, without fail, be awakened by three songbirds at the end of the eighth hour.
> 
> The number eight is symbolically important, as this adventure plays with the themes of time and nostalgia. The numeral 8 resembles an hourglass, which measures the passage of time, and looks like the symbol for infinity (∞) turned on its side. Hidden within the numeral 8 itself is the numeral 3. In the D&D multiverse, there exists the Rule of Three, which states that events of cosmic consequence often manifest in threes. Time, for instance, has a past, present, and future. The Hourglass Coven has three members. The fey domain of Prismeer is divided into three splinter-realms, which adventurers explore with the help of three guides.
> 
> Hidden within the adventure are numerous other mentions of the numbers eight and three. Can you find them all?
^eight-and-three

#### Interior Maps

Maps that appear in this book are for your eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or another surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your hand-drawn maps need not be faithful to the originals, and you can alter a map's features as you see fit. Nor do your maps need to be painstakingly rendered. You can omit details that are not readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.

##### Slopes and Staircases

An arrow on a slope or staircase always points in the ascending direction.

#### Landmarks Not to Scale

The poster map of Prismeer and the interior maps of Hither, Thither, and Yon show important landmarks that are described in the text. These landmarks are not drawn to scale.

### Using the Story Tracker

This adventure uses a Story Tracker, a copy of which is included at the back of this book. The Story Tracker is a note-keeping tool to help you remember important information about the characters and their accomplishments.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/000-00-001-unicorn-horn.webp#center)

At various times in the adventure, you will be advised to jot down information on the Story Tracker, as events that happen in earlier chapters can give characters an advantage in later chapters. The Story Tracker also allows you to record important details. For example, if a character falls under a curse, noting the specifics of the curse on the Story Tracker might remind you of the effect.

#### Unicorn Horn

A lost unicorn horn plays an important part in the adventure. Its location is determined randomly by rolling on the Unicorn Horn's Location table. Once you determine where the horn is, record its location on the Story Tracker.

The horn belongs to a unicorn named Elidon, who was captured and transformed into a rocking horse by the Hourglass Coven. For more information about Elidon, see area L6 in chapter 3.

### Tips for New Dungeon Masters

Most of this book is for the DM's eyes only, since it's full of secrets that your players won't discover until you run the adventure for them. That said, the adventure contains a lot of information that can be shared with the players at specific times, as discussed below.

#### New Character Options

During character creation, you can allow your players to read the new backgrounds and race options that appear in this introduction, if you're comfortable with allowing these options in your game.

#### Magic Item Descriptions

When the characters acquire a new magic item and figure out what it does (see ""Identifying a Magic Item"" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"), give that item's description to the players.

#### Statistics

Creature stat blocks should be kept hidden from the players until circumstances warrant otherwise, as discussed below.

##### Armor Class

When characters make attacks against a creature, you compare those attacks to the creature's Armor Class to determine whether the attacks hit. After a certain number of hits and misses, players can usually pinpoint a creature's AC on their own. However, in the interest of speeding up combat, you can divulge a creature's AC once the characters have hit the creature at least once, allowing players to know without asking if attacks made against the creature hit or miss.

##### Hit Points

It's better not to tell players how many hit points a creature has. However, you can give the players a sense of how well they're doing against the creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded or on the ropes. Such information gives the players a sense of accomplishment and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren't putting much of a dent in the creature's hit points, either because it has a lot of them or it has a trait such as Regeneration, it's a good idea to let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That information alone might encourage the players to consider a change of plan, such as a tactical retreat.

##### Damage

Players need you to tell them how much damage their characters take and what type of damage it is. Whenever the adventure presents damage that is variable, it shows the average damage first, followed by a die expression in parentheses, like this: 10 (`3d6`). You decide whether to use the average or roll the dice. Using average damage speeds up play, but it might feel less exciting, and players can take advantage of its predictability. Rolling the dice takes more time but can yield more volatile results. In the interest of fairness, commit to one approach or the other for the duration of an encounter or game session.

##### Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses

As their characters fight a creature, players expect to learn more about the creature's strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. It's okay to share such information with them as it becomes apparent. For example, you can describe a creature's wounds closing up when it regenerates.

Characters don't need to fight a creature to know certain facts about it. For example, a character who has the Witchlight hand background and chose a sprite for a carnival companion would know a lot about sprites, including their ability to turn [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible). Similarly, if a character intuits that a [treant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md), being a creature made of wood, has vulnerability to fire damage, just smile faintly and say, "That's a reasonable hypothesis." If the treant takes double damage from a [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md) spell, be sure to let players know how badly the fire hurt it.

Don't be afraid to dole out information to characters who have the applicable knowledge. If you're not sure whether the characters possess such knowledge, have them make an Intelligence check (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more guidance about "ability checks"), and share the information if one or more characters succeed on the check.

#### Dice Rolls

Many DMs like to roll their dice in the open, for all the players to see, to maintain transparency. Other DMs prefer to roll dice behind a screen to maintain suspense. Either approach is fine.

Even DMs who conceal their dice rolls might divulge certain results. For example, when a creature scores a critical hit against a character, it's customary to let the player know that their character just took a particularly nasty hit before revealing how much damage was dealt.

It's okay to ask one of your players to make a die roll for you. For example, if you plan to use one of this adventure's random encounters, you can have a player roll to determine what the characters encounter, rather than making the roll yourself.

#### Story Information

Important information that doesn't appear in boxed text is usually communicated to players through roleplaying. As the DM, you roleplay all the creatures that the characters encounter in the adventure. Many of the DM-controlled creatures (also called nonplayer characters, or NPCs) in this adventure know information that the characters can learn through inquiry. The adventure outlines the most likely circumstances under which a creature will share what it knows.

The adventure describes important creatures in detail, while creatures of little consequence get no more than a passing reference. As such, you have enough information to bring important creatures to life, but not so much that it becomes a chore to remember all the details. The adventure seldom goes so far as to describe what a creature sounds like, nor does it reveal everything that a creature might say or do. You're expected to improvise and bring creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) (one of the owners of the Witchlight Carnival) as a flamboyant figure, but you get to decide what his voice sounds like and how he reacts to a given situation, based on what the adventure says about him. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) or any other creature as you see fit.

##### Roleplaying Aids

Appendix B contains information that will help you roleplay a handful of important DM-controlled characters whose actions propel and shape the narrative of the adventure. The cards in appendix D serve much the same purpose but are optional; they provide roleplaying notes for several other colorful characters who aren't as pivotal. You can photocopy these cards, cut them out, and keep them in a handy stack behind your DM screen, sorted alphabetically or grouped by chapter. (The latter option works better if you expect the current game session to focus entirely on one chapter of the adventure.)

> [!note] Making Mistakes
> 
> Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even the most experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. This is a big adventure with lots of interconnecting elements; no one expects you to internalize or memorize every aspect of it. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.

## Feywild Trinkets

The [Feywild Trinkets](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/feywild-trinket-wbtw.md) table that follows offers a selection of trinkets appropriate for Feywild-themed adventures such as this one. Players whose characters have the [feylost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/feylost-wbtw.md) or [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/witchlight-hand-wbtw.md) background can roll on this table instead of the "Trinkets" table in the "Player's Handbook" to determine what trinkets their characters possess. The adventure includes a few encounters that require you to roll on the table to determine what random trinkets the characters find in key locations.

## Backgrounds

This section describes two backgrounds available to characters who participate in this adventure: [feylost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/feylost-wbtw.md) and [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/witchlight-hand-wbtw.md).

## Races

All the character races presented in the "Player's Handbook" are well suited for this adventure, as are [fairies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/fairy-mpmm.md) and [harengons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/harengon-mpmm.md).

If you allow players to create fairy or harengon characters for this adventure, they should assume that their characters are from the same world as the other player characters and have never set foot in the Feywild despite their fey heritage.

## Character Traits

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/006-00-007-butterfly.webp#center)

As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the "Player's Handbook", or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.

![The arrival of the Witchli...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/007-00-008.webp#center "The arrival of the Witchlight Carnival is a highly anticipated event")

## Beginning the Adventure

How the characters become embroiled in the adventure depends on which hook you use to pull them into it. Choose either the "Lost Things" or "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook. Both hooks assume that all the characters come from the same world, even if they don't have a history together.

The adventure also assumes that the characters (even ones with the Witchlight hand background) have no prior knowledge of Zybilna, the Feywild domain of Prismeer, or the Hourglass Coven. None of these names should be familiar to them at the outset.

### Lost Things

Use this adventure hook if you want the characters to have a strong personal investment in the story. Choose a settlement in the characters' world near which the Witchlight Carnival will appear.

Each character in the adventuring party visited the Witchlight Carnival when they were a child—in fact, they snuck in without buying a ticket—and had something stolen from them. Fate brings the characters together as adults, united by the common goal of retrieving that which they've lost.

The adventure begins shortly after the Witchlight Carnival returns to the characters' world for the first time in eight years. One or more characters might be Witchlight hands or troubadours who have spent years traveling with the carnival; the remaining party members are assumed to be visitors who remember the carnival from childhood. It's possible for certain characters to know each other, either because they work together at the carnival or because they're from the same settlement.

Retrieving their lost things will require the characters to explore the Feywild regions of Hither, Thither, and Yon (described in chapters 2, 3 and 4) and contend with the hags of the Hourglass Coven. The characters might be tempted to visit the Palace of Heart's Desire as well (see chapter 5), but they can avoid this location and still accomplish their goals.

#### Setting the Stage

After the players create their characters, use the following boxed text to kick off the adventure:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The traveling extravaganza known as the Witchlight Carnival visits your world once every eight years. You have a dim memory of sneaking into the carnival as a child without paying for a ticket. That memory has grown foggy over time, though it still conjures a weird admixture of emotions—wonder and awe mixed with loss and regret. During this childhood visit, your character lost something. You tried to find it, but the carnival owners—a pair of elves named [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md)—were decidedly unhelpful.
> 
> "Silly little screeching cricket," said Witch. "You forgot to buy a ticket."
> 
> "The carnival goes round and round," said Light. "The multiverse is our playground. Nothing's free and nothing's lost. Every visit has its cost."
> 
> As time passed, your heart became less heavy, and you gave less and less thought to those childhood events. Now, for reasons you can't explain, the longing to retrieve that which you have lost has resurfaced, as though an old spell has faded away, allowing you to feel the loss as sharply as if it happened yesterday.
> 
> The Witchlight Carnival has returned, and you find yourself standing near a ticket booth by the entrance at twilight, just as the carnival is about to open. There you meet others who look as troubled as you. Without knowing how or why, you sense that each of them has lost something as well. Perhaps fate has brought you together.
^048

Work with the players to establish what connections, if any, the characters have with each other. For example, some or all of the characters might hail from a nearby village and have known each other for years.

Characters who have the [Witchlight hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/witchlight-hand-wbtw.md) background would also know each other, since they worked together prior to the start of the adventure. They, too, are standing outside the carnival when the adventure begins.

If you haven't done so already, lay out the poster map of the Witchlight Carnival for the players to see.

#### Determining What Was Lost

Each character, having lost something precious as a child, is unable to gain "inspiration" (as described in the "Player's Handbook") until they get back what was taken from them. A [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell is not powerful enough to end this effect on a character, but a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell can. This might not seem like much of a drawback, as characters can cope just fine without ever gaining inspiration. Think of it more as a splinter under one's fingernail—a nagging, mildly painful annoyance that slightly diminishes one's happiness. (Hags, by their cruel actions, can spread aggravation and misery throughout the multiverse in all sorts of ways.)

The players don't know it yet, but the Witchlight Carnival operates under a peculiar set of rules. By entering the carnival without tickets as children, the characters inadvertently set themselves up to be robbed. Whatever thing was taken from each character as a child vanished suddenly while that character was distracted by the magic of the carnival. All such thefts can be traced back to the hags of Prismeer, who use thieves to acquire and collect all manner of strange things and to whom the carnival owners are beholden.

For each character in the adventuring party, roll a `d8` and consult the Lost Things table to determine what was stolen from that character. If a player doesn't like their result, let them choose an option they prefer. You can swap out some of the entries on the Lost Things table with others that you or your players create, using the ones described below as models.

Use the adventure's Story Tracker to record what each character has lost.

**Lost Things**

`dice: [](01-into-the-feywild.md#^lost-things)`

| dice: d8 | Thing |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Ability to keep secrets |
| 2 | Ability to smile |
| 3 | Artistic creativity |
| 4 | Cherished doll or stuffed animal |
| 5 | Handwriting |
| 6 | Sense of direction |
| 7 | Sense of fashion |
| 8 | Three inches of height |
^lost-things

The hags used each character's lost thing to craft a magic item. By interacting with the magic item in a specific way (as described below), the character regains what they lost. The magic item otherwise functions normally.

##### Ability to Keep Secrets

The character is unable to keep a secret. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a [wand of secrets](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-secrets.md). The character regains the ability to keep secrets by holding this wand for the first time.

##### Ability to Smile

The character suffering from this loss is unable to smile. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a [wand of smiles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-smiles-xge.md) (see appendix A). The character regains the ability to smile by holding this wand for the first time.

##### Artistic Creativity

The character suffering from this loss lacks the ability to be creative in one or more artistic pursuits. For example, they might be unable to draw, paint, or compose original music. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a [pipe of smoke monsters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pipe-of-smoke-monsters-xge.md) (see appendix A). The character regains their creativity by puffing on the pipe for the first time.

##### Cherished Doll or Stuffed Animal

The character lost a doll or stuffed animal (player's choice). The hag who claimed this prize has since turned it into a [talking doll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/talking-doll-xge.md) (see appendix A) or a stuffed animal with similar properties.

##### Handwriting

To all other creatures, the character's handwriting is illegible and requires a [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md) spell or similar magic to decipher. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create an [instrument of scribing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-scribing-xge.md) (see appendix A). The DM chooses the kind of instrument. When the character plays this instrument for the first time, their handwriting becomes legible.

![An Adventurer with No Fashion Sense](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/008-00-009-adventurer.webp#center)

##### Sense of Direction

The character suffering from this loss has trouble figuring out which way is north and where they are geographically. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create an [orb of direction](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/orb-of-direction-xge.md) (see appendix A). The character regains their sense of direction by holding this orb for the first time.

##### Sense of Fashion

The character suffering from this loss has no fashion sense. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a [cloak of many fashions](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cloak-of-many-fashions-xge.md) (see appendix A). The character regains their lost sense of fashion by donning this cloak for the first time.

##### Three Inches of Height

The character suffering from this loss knows they are shorter than they ought to be. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a [pole of collapsing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pole-of-collapsing-xge.md) (see appendix A). The character grows three inches in height by holding this pole for the first time.

#### Keepers of Lost Things

Once you know what has been stolen from a character, roll on the Keepers of Lost Things table to determine which hag has the thing in question. Use the adventure's Story Tracker to record this information.

**Keepers of Lost Things**

`dice: [](01-into-the-feywild.md#^keepers-of-lost-things)`

| dice: d8 | Hag |

| 7–8 | [Endelyn Moongrave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md) |

#### Minor Curses

At your discretion, each character who lost something as a child might carry a minor curse as well. Unlike the inability to gain inspiration, this minor curse can be lifted with a [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. The nature of the minor curse affecting each character depends on which hag took what the character lost. After rolling on the Keepers of Lost Things table for each character, consult the Minor Curses table to determine what minor curse besets that character.

Use the adventure's Story Tracker to record this information, then ask each player to also be mindful of their character's minor curse.

**Minor Curses**

| Hag | Curse |
|-----|-------|
| Bavlorna | You can't light nonmagical fires. |
| Skabatha | You can't tie or untie a nonmagical rope. |
| Endelyn | You can't open a door without knocking on it first. |

### Warlock's Quest

Use this hook if you or your players don't like the idea of the characters having to find things that they lost as children and would prefer a more traditional adventure setup. This hook requires that one or more characters have backgrounds unconnected to the Witchlight Carnival.

If you're using the adventure's Story Tracker, you won't need to fill out the "Lost Things" section. Just leave it blank.

In this preamble, an aging warlock named Madryck Roslof tells the characters (those not working at the Witchlight Carnival) about a faerie realm called Prismeer, which can be reached only by finding and using a fey crossing in the carnival. Madryck says that his archfey patron, Zybilna, rules Prismeer. He begs the characters to journey to this domain and find out what has happened to Zybilna, with whom he has lost contact.

If you like, you can replace Madryck Roslof with a different NPC who better suits your campaign. Whether Madryck or someone else gives the quest, the characters must travel across the land of Prismeer to reach the Palace of Heart's Desire (described in chapter 5), where Zybilna is frozen in time. Because this quest is more difficult than the one tied to the "Lost Things" adventure hook, the potential rewards are greater.

> [!note] Warlocks of the Archfey
> 
> If the adventuring party includes a warlock whose otherworldly patron is the Archfey, consider allowing that character's player to choose Zybilna as the warlock's patron. Warlocks who make pacts with Zybilna regard her as a generous, fairy godmother-like figure.
^warlocks-of-the-archfey

#### Setting the Stage

Identify which players have chosen the Witchlight hand background for their characters, then separate those players from the rest of the group—for now. They will join the others once everyone has gathered at the Witchlight Carnival.

To kick off the adventure, read the following boxed text to the players whose characters aren't part of the carnival:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You have been summoned to the abode of a human warlock named Madryck Roslof. He lives on a giant pumpkin farm, sharing his rustic farmhouse space with rodents and pixies. His adventuring days are behind him, and he looks quite old and frail. Nevertheless, he is delighted to make your acquaintance.
> 
> "I've acquired many treasures and made important contacts during my lengthy adventuring career," says Madryck. "I would like to pass the treasures I possess and the favors I am owed to you. In exchange, I ask that you travel to Prismeer, a domain in the Feywild, and find out what fate has befallen the archfey that rules it. This archfey, Zybilna, is my patron and inspiration—the source of my power.
> 
> "I have been unable to contact Zybilna for the better part of a year, and I fear something terrible has happened. My adventuring days are over, but Zybilna has been good to me, and I would like to know she is well before I take my leave.
> 
> "Every eight years, our world is visited by a traveling extravaganza called the Witchlight Carnival. It recently returned and is camped three days' travel from here. I'm asking you now because this carnival might pack up and leave in a week or two, and it contains your only route to Prismeer—a fey crossing, if you will.
> 
> "Seek out Zybilna of Prismeer, help her if you can, and return with proof that she is alive and well. Upon your return, all the hard-won earnings of my adventuring career shall be yours."
^057

![Madryck Roslof](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/the-wild-beyond-the-witchlight/img/009-00-010-madryck-roslof.webp#center)

The players will undoubtedly want to know more about the rewards Madryck is offering. See "Madryck's Treasure" later in this section for a summary. (If you allow your players to make wish lists of magic items for their characters, you can replace one or more of Madryck's magic item rewards with items from those lists.)

Madryck doesn't need to have a past relationship with any of the characters, but if the players want to tie Madryck more closely to their characters' back stories, allow it. Madryck is a [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) (neutral good) who speaks Common, Sylvan, and two other languages of your choice. Although he has been out of touch with Zybilna for almost a year, he knows that time passes differently in parts of the Feywild, including Zybilna's realm of Prismeer. He can't predict how much time it will take for the characters to complete their quest; they might come back in a matter of days, or years could pass on the Material Plane before they return. Not wanting to alarm the characters, Madryck tries to steer the conversation away from issues involving the passage of time, if one or more characters mention something about it.

#### What Madryck Knows

If the characters request more information about the Witchlight Carnival, Madryck says that he hasn't visited the carnival in sixty-four years and admits that a lot can change in that time. He advises the characters to explore the carnival thoroughly on their own. He doesn't presume to know what form the fey crossing currently takes or how well hidden and protected it is. He does provide the following reliable information:

- Zybilna is a fairy godmother to mortals. She created the carnival as a means by which mortals could enter her realm and beseech her aid.  
- When Madryck last visited the carnival, it was run by a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named [Mister Witch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md). He assumes they're still in charge.  
- Madryck dimly recalls that Witch and Light acquired the carnival more than a hundred years ago from an eladrin (an elf native to the Feywild). The eladrin's name escapes him.  

If the characters request more information about Zybilna and Prismeer, Madryck offers the following descriptions, based on firsthand knowledge that is somewhat out of date:

- Prismeer is a domain of delight ruled by Zybilna, who dwells in the Palace of Heart's Desire, a magnificent structure in the heart of the domain.  
- Zybilna can assume many forms and is brilliant, secretive, and wise. (Madryck doesn't know Zybilna's secret identity, as revealed in chapter 5.)  
- When she presents herself to mortals, Zybilna usually assumes the form of a statuesque woman with long white hair and a small tattoo shaped like a chicken's foot below one eye.  

Each character who hears Madryck's description of Zybilna suddenly recalls a forgotten childhood memory of her, which you can determine by having that character's player roll on the Childhood Memories table.

**Childhood Memories**

`dice: [](01-into-the-feywild.md#^childhood-memories)`

| dice: d8 | Memory |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | When you were a small child, a woman matching Zybilna's description reunited you with a lost pet. |
| 2 | A woman matching Zybilna's description visited you once when you were sick as a child and made you feel better. |
| 3 | A woman matching Zybilna's description scared away a bully who antagonized you as a child. |
| 4 | You remember an older family member telling you about a woman with long white hair who helped deliver you when you were born. |
| 5 | A woman matching Zybilna's description gave money to your family so that you never wanted for anything as a child. |
| 6 | You used to have trouble speaking as a child until a woman matching Zybilna's description put her hand on your head. |
| 7 | You fell into an icy pond as a child and probably would have died had a woman matching Zybilna's description not fished you out of the cold water and wrapped you in a blanket. |
| 8 | You remember sneaking into the Witchlight Carnival as a child and running into a woman matching Zybilna's description. She gave you a cupcake that made you feel special when you ate it. |

#### To the Carnival

Characters who accept Madryck's quest can make the uneventful trek to the carnival, which is located not too far from a settlement of your choosing. The characters arrive shortly before twilight. When they arrive, lay out the poster map of the carnival for the players to see.

After revealing the map, read the following boxed text to any players whose characters have the Witchlight hand background (or skip it if no character meets this criterion):

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three days ago, you were approached by a friendly faerie dragon in the service of a human warlock named Madryck Roslof. This faerie dragon foretold the arrival of adventurers seeking a path to the Feywild through the carnival. Although you've heard that the carnival contains a fey crossing, you've never gone to the trouble of finding it. The faerie dragon thought you might want to help these adventurers. It even went so far as to imply that the fate of the Witchlight Carnival might hinge on the success of their endeavors.
> 
> As twilight draws near, a large crowd begins to gather outside, eager to buy tickets and enjoy the carnival's many attractions. As you gaze upon the crowd, one or more visitors catch your eye. Something about them suggests they're not the usual rabble.
^05a

Allow the characters who have the Witchlight hand background to interact as they see fit with the characters who met with Madryck Roslof. These interactions can occur before or after the carnival opens its gates to visitors.

#### Madryck's Treasure

Madryck keeps the treasure from his adventuring days in a locked wooden chest that is buried in a secret location far from his modest dwelling. He carries the chest's only key, the head of which is made of stained glass and shaped like a violet faerie dragon.

If the characters accept the quest and return with proof that Zybilna is alive and well, Madryck gives them his key and directions to the buried chest, which contains the following treasure:

- A [bag of beans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-beans.md)  
- A [cloak of displacement](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cloak-of-displacement.md)  
- A suit of [+2 leather armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-armor.md)  
- A [+2 wand of the war mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-wand-of-the-war-mage.md)  
- A silk bag containing eight 500 gp gemstones  
- Three folded letters (described below)  

##### Letter 1

This letter is stamped with the official wax seal of a fairly large settlement (choose an appropriate town or city that exists in your campaign world). It reads, "The bearer of this letter is entitled to a favor in exchange for services, previously rendered, of a heroic nature." This letter can be presented to the settlement's leader or leaders, who would then grant the letter's bearer a favor. This favor can take the form of free room and board for up to a year, the gift of a small estate or parcel of land, an audience with someone of great influence (such as a king or queen), or some other benefit of your choosing.

##### Letter 2

This letter has similar text to the first letter, as well as the symbol of a deity worshiped in your campaign world (choose an appropriate deity). This letter can be taken to any temple where that deity is worshiped and presented to the high priest, who would then grant the letter's bearer a favor. An example of an appropriate favor would be one free casting of a spell of 5th level or lower from the cleric spell list, such as [commune](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune.md) or [raise dead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/raise-dead.md).

##### Letter 3

This letter bears the signature and arcane sigil of Saya Kalternax, a wizard known throughout the land. (You can replace this wizard with another mage that better suits your campaign.) The letter describes the kinship between this wizard and the adventuring party to which Madryck once belonged. It concludes with, "By the terms of a magically binding agreement, the bearer of this letter is owed one favor from Saya Kalternax or, in the event of their untimely demise, one of Saya's devoted apprentices." Although Saya died a few years ago, this letter can be presented to one of their apprentices (who might be difficult to locate, at your discretion). Examples of an appropriate favor would be the brewing of a rare or uncommon potion, the scribing of a rare or uncommon scroll, or the loan of a spellbook containing a selection of wizard spells of 5th level and lower. If you need statistics for this spellcaster, use the [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) stat block. Give the mage whatever alignment and languages you like.

If Madryck passes away before the characters return from their Feywild excursion (an event likely to occur only if the characters delay their return by a year or longer), he leaves behind a trusted associate who can give them the key and provide directions to his hidden treasure. This associate might be a friendly pixie or faerie dragon, an awakened squirrel (the beneficiary of a druid's [awaken](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/awaken.md) spell), or some other trustworthy creature of Madryck's acquaintance.

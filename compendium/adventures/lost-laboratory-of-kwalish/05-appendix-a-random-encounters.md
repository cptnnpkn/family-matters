# Appendix A: Random Encounters
*Source: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish, p. 32* 

Characters undertaking this adventure will spend a significant amount of game time on the journey to the Monastery of the Distressed Body and the lost city of Daoine Gloine. You can help bring those weeks of exploration to life with random encounters—some of which might increase or decrease the length of the characters' journey, as you decide.

"Chapter 2" of "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" includes random forest encounters, Underdark encounters, and mountain encounters. Or you can roll for or select more detailed encounters using the following tables.

## Wilderness Encounters

Reaching the foothills of the Barrier Peaks takes the characters through a broad range of wild lands—including woods infused with the power of the Feywild.

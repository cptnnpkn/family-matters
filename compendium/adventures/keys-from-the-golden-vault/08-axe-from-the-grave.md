# Axe from the Grave
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault, p. 103* 

*An Adventure for 6th-Level Characters*

Famed bard Froderic Dartwild is dead, and his beautiful mandolin, called Golden Axe, has been stolen from his grave. Even worse, Froderic has risen as a zombie, terrifying the hamlet of Toadhop. In this heist, the characters must track down Golden Axe from the music school owner who stole it and return it to Froderic so the bard can rest peacefully in death once again.

## Adventure Background

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/052-07-002-ch7-key.webp#center)

Froderic Dartwild—Frody to those who knew him well—was a gifted human bard born and raised in the hamlet of Toadhop. He could play the mandolin by age three and performed regularly at Toadhop's local tavern until his eighteenth year, when he left this bucolic backwater and became an adventurer. But his adventuring exploits paled in comparison to his reputation as a performer. So gifted a musician was he that an admiring wizard gave Frody an [instrument of the bards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.md)—a famous Canaith mandolin called Golden Axe. The mandolin's magic served Frody well during his many adventures but wasn't enough to save his life. On a crisp autumn day, Frody and his companions were beset by manticores on a lonely stretch of road, and Frody was killed by a manticore's tail spike.

Frody's body was returned to Toadhop and laid to rest in the earth next to his mother, Veena, and his sister, Marigold. Golden Axe was buried with him. Shortly after Frody was interred, a tiefling named [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md), who lived many miles away, learned of the famous bard's untimely death.

Sythian had inherited his parents' estate and debts, but a mysterious poison killed off the family's olive orchard, leaving him with nothing but the mansion and its furnishings. Those furnishings included a multitude of musical instruments Sythian's parents had bought in the hopes of making him a musical prodigy. While he excelled at none of the instruments, he realized he could pay off his family's debts by turning his home into a conservatory for young musicians from wealthy families. One of his current students, Wylie van Timmel, shows great promise. Sythian hatched a plan to snatch Golden Axe from Frody's grave and give it to Wylie as a present, hoping to earn the favor and long-term financial support of her wealthy family.

Sythian hired a pair of halflings named Mackerel Mudbottom and Trout Bonanza to dig up Frody's remains and pry the Canaith mandolin from his hands. They did just that, leaving behind an open grave. After the halflings fled with the mandolin, Frody awakened, crawled from his coffin, shambled to his mother's old cabin, and knocked on the door. The young family living there fled in terror at the sight of him and took shelter in a neighbor's barn. The good folks of Toadhop have been on edge ever since.

The characters arrive in Toadhop and quickly discover that someone has disturbed the grave of a famous bard named Froderic Dartwild and that Frody's corpse is "none too happy about it." Locals ask the characters to speak with Frody, who is holed up in a cabin on the outskirts of the hamlet. From Frody's zombified corpse, the characters learn that the stolen mandolin is called Golden Axe. They also learn the identities of the grave robbers who stole the mandolin, as Frody's restless spirit heard the halflings refer to each other by name before they inadvertently animated his corpse. Frody refuses to return to his grave until the mandolin is returned to him.

If the characters agree to retrieve the mandolin, they find Mackerel and Trout at their riverside abode, five miles from Toadhop. The two halflings reveal that their employer, [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md), has Golden Axe in his possession and plans to give it to one of his students. Stealing Golden Axe from Skalderang Conservatory forms the crux of this adventure. Ideally, at least one character in the party should be a bard.

The hamlet of Toadhop can be situated in any countryside. Skalderang Conservatory stands in the middle of a dead olive orchard on the outskirts of a city that's about two days' travel from Toadhop on horseback.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open their music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Greetings, operatives. A Canaith mandolin has been stolen from the grave of a famous bard, whose spirit remains restless from the injustice. The Golden Vault wants the instrument returned to its proper owner. This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to travel to the village of Toadhop. Details will reveal themselves to you shortly after your arrival. Good luck, operatives."
^28c

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

## Toadhop

The rustic hamlet of Toadhop boasts a population of thirty—all hardworking folk. Two local establishments cater to visitors: a ramshackle inn called Misty's Bunks and a quaint tavern called My Left Boot. Toadhop's honorary mayor, a brown sow named Jenna Bean, pays visits to the tavern to greet strangers. To dispel any doubts concerning Jenna Bean's role in Toadhop, the hamlet's cheery tavernkeeper, Huberta Hadley, uses white paint to write the word "Mayor" on the friendly sow's flanks.

### Frody Dartwild

Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to begin the adventure:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Froderic Dartwild, a famous bard born and raised in Toadhop, is all anyone in the hamlet can talk about. You've already met Toadhop's honorary mayor: a friendly sow named Jenna Bean. You've also seen the frightened, troubled looks on the faces of the simple, hard-working folk who inhabit this rustic thorp.
> 
> You see, Frody died almost a month ago. Everyone in town attended his funeral. Now, he's crawled from his grave and returned to the cabin where he was born and where he spent his childhood. The family that owns the cabin now is out of sorts, to say the least. The family that lives there—a father, a mother, and their three daughters—is staying with neighbors until this grave matter is resolved.
> 
> The good folk of Toadhop would like it very much if you, being adventurers, could pay a visit to the old Dartwild cabin and find out why Toadhop's most famous bard has returned from the dead. The sooner he stops stinking up the place, the sooner he can be laid to rest—again.
^28f

If the characters wish to help Frody and the people of Toadhop, they can get directions to the old Dartwild cabin and check it out. Four unkempt youths led by a rabblerouser named Ebbin Fulchre spot the characters as they make their way to the Dartwild cabin and follow them, curious to see what happens next.

### The Old Dartwild Cabin

As the characters approach the cabin, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The front door of the cabin is wide open, and a rotten stench emanates from it. A noise behind you signals the arrival of four clumsy local youths, who keep their distance from the cabin once they catch a whiff of something unnatural.
> 
> "Dang if they ain't goin' inside!" exclaims one youth.
> 
> "Shut up, or Frody might hear you!" hisses another.
^291

Ebbin Fulchre and his three companions are unarmed [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) who refuse to enter the cabin, even on a dare. Morbid curiosity brought them here, but they're nothing more than harmless spectators.

When the characters enter the cabin, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cabin is full of buzzing flies. Seated in a dark corner behind a rickety kitchen table is what's attracting the flies: a putrid human corpse with yellow eyes. In a raspy voice, the creature says, "Well met. My name is Froderic Dartwild. My friends call me Frody."
^292

[Frody Dartwild](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/frody-dartwild-kftgv.md) is neutral good, speaks Common, and has an Intelligence score of 10; he otherwise uses the [zombie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) stat block.

#### Bard's Quest

Frody didn't intend to frighten away the cabin's proper owners, but his appearance can't be helped, and he has nowhere else to go. Toadhop's inhabitants are too frightened to speak to him, so Frody has been waiting for braver souls to arrive so he can explain his plight to them. Given the chance, he imparts the following information:

- **Grave Theft.** Two halflings dug up his grave in the dead of night and stole his Canaith mandolin (an [instrument of the bards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.md)). Frody wants it back. ("It was a gift," he says.) The mandolin has a name: Golden Axe.  
- **Halfling Robbers.** The grave robbers' names were Mackerel and Trout. Frody's waking spirit could hear the halflings talking to each other as they broke into his coffin. However, Frody could do nothing to stop the theft of his mandolin, and the halflings were long gone by the time he figured out how to animate his own corpse.  
- **Halflings' Whereabouts.** The two halflings had local accents. Someone in Toadhop might know where to find them.  

Frody agrees to return peacefully to his grave if the characters find and retrieve his stolen mandolin. If the characters slay Frody instead, he reappears 24 hours later as a neutral good [ghost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) and haunts Toadhop until his spirit finds rest—which happens only when Golden Axe is returned to Frody's grave.

## Mackerel and Trout

Characters who share what they learned with the living residents of Toadhop discover that Mackerel Mudbottom and Trout Bonanza are well known in these parts. The two halflings live about five miles away, in a hut on stilts next to a river. The halflings catch crayfish and frogs and sell them in Toadhop occasionally.

If the characters pay Mackerel and Trout a visit, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A lopsided wooden hut squats on four wooden stilts next to the sandy shore of a shallow river.
> 
> You see two halflings in overalls, both enjoying the day. One is next to the hut, feeding a carrot to a mule, while the other stands in the middle of the river, futzing with a broken crayfish trap.
^295

Mackerel and Trout are unarmed [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md). The characters can approach the halflings openly or attempt to sneak up on them. The [mule](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mule.md), which the halflings have named Lucky Me, doesn't startle easily.

The mule doesn't belong to the halflings; they found it tied to a tree by a road and took it, probably while its owner was answering the call of nature. The halflings feed the mule wild carrots and turnips that grow in a tiny garden under their hut.

### Questioning the Halflings

Mackerel and Trout used to pick olives in the Skalderang orchard until all its trees died suddenly. They suspect the orchard was poisoned (by whom, they don't know). Now they catch and sell crayfish and frogs, supplementing their meager income by performing occasional chores for [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md).

Mackerel and Trout were paid to steal the Canaith mandolin. Characters who search the halflings' cramped hut find a small purse containing 20 gp. The halflings have yet to decide what to buy with their ill-gotten gold. They reckon they might get a nice dragonchess set, although neither of them knows how to play the game.

The halflings have no idea their foray into grave robbing has awakened an undead creature; the thought of Froderic Dartwild exacting revenge from beyond the grave is enough to make them confess everything. In fact, any serious questioning or threat of harm earns the pair's cooperation. The halflings readily share the following information:

- **Sythian.** [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) has Golden Axe.  
- **Sythian's Debts.** Sythian is plagued by debt collectors. To help pay off debts, Sythian turned his mansion into a conservatory where young musicians from wealthy families can hone their craft. Sythian is a musician himself, though neither Mackerel nor Trout has heard Sythian perform or is familiar with his work.  
- **Van Timmels.** Sythian plans to give Golden Axe to Wylie van Timmel, one of his pupils. The van Timmels are filthy rich, and Sythian believes their financial support is worth more than the mandolin itself.  

### Halfling Sandcastle

Mackerel and Trout don't have a map of Skalderang Conservatory, but they know it well enough to make a miniature version from sand. Building the sandcastle takes them about 20 minutes.

When the halflings' sandcastle is complete, show players the accompanying Skalderang Conservatory sandcastle illustration (map 7.1), which depicts the location from two points of view. The characters can use the sandcastle to help plan their heist.

![Map 7.1: Players' Map](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/053-07-003-player-map.webp#center)

## Planning the Heist

The rest of the adventure revolves around the theft of Golden Axe from Skalderang Conservatory. Whether the characters return the mandolin to its proper owner, keep it for themselves, or do something else with it is for them to decide.

In addition to providing a sandcastle model of Skalderang Conservatory, Mackerel and Trout furnish the characters with the following information, which is framed as boxed text that you can read or paraphrase to the players.

### About the Conservatory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The conservatory has four floors, counting the roof. The outer doors—that's a double door in front and a back door leading to the kitchen—they're good, sturdy oak and barred shut at night. And all the windows are latched shut from the inside. We maybe checked.
> 
> "From the skylights on the roof, you can see the third-floor room that holds Sythian's fancy instruments. Sythian's quarters are somewhere on the third floor, too. He let most of the staff go, excepting the cook and housekeeper. They sleep next to the kitchen on the ground floor. The students live on the second floor—they each get a room, but they take their vittles in the dining hall on the first floor.
> 
> "There are staircases between all the floors in the towers, and an elevator powered by magic that runs between the dining hall and the second and third floors."
^29a

### About Sythian Skalderang

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Sythian is a tiefling with blue skin and black horns. He's not the most likable person. He rains on everyone's parade. His folks must've never taught him how to be nice, so when he tries, he mucks it up. He's always unhappy and never has anything nice to say. I got no idea what a rich guy like that's got to be unhappy about.
> 
> "Sythian wears a master key around his neck that unlocks doors inside the conservatory. Vordell, the housekeeper, has another master key.
> 
> "One more thing. Sythian is terrified of frogs and toads—has been ever since he was swallowed by a giant toad as a young boy. He'd kill us for telling you that."
^29c

Mackerel and Trout know that frogs commonly huddle near the river. A character who spends at least 15 minutes walking along the shoreline can make a DC 13 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, locating `1d4` [frogs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/frog.md) on a success. Catching a frog requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

### About Joster Mareet

[Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) has an [incubus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) acquaintance who goes by the name [Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md). This servant of the demon lord Graz'zt usually takes the form of a tall, beautiful, male tiefling. The incubus has telepathy out to a range of 60 feet, enabling the fiend to have telepathic conversations with Sythian even when they're not in the same room.

Joster came knocking shortly after Sythian inherited the Skalderang estate. Unknown to Sythian, Joster was responsible for poisoning the Skalderang olive orchard. Joster was following instructions from Graz'zt, with the goal of making Sythian stop growing olives. Joster wants Sythian to use connections gained through the students' elite families to earn their patronage. With that newfound wealth and influence, Sythian could ruin lives and lead a decadent cult worthy of Graz'zt.

Sythian knows Joster is an incubus but is under the false impression that Joster cares for his well-being.

Mackerel and Trout know the following information about Joster:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "One of Sythian's friends is staying at the castle—a tall, handsome tiefling chap named [Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md). He has red skin, yellow horns, and a smoky voice. Joster doesn't do much except hang around the estate, although sometimes he paints portraits of the students.
> 
> "Joster showed up shortly after the Skalderang orchard died and encouraged Sythian to open his home to gifted musicians. We caught Joster chatting with a little green-skinned demon, which turned invisible the instant it saw us. Joster pretended like the demon wasn't there, but we saw it, all right."
^29e

### About the Students

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Sythian has four students currently. They all reside at the conservatory, but their families have grand estates in the nearby city.
> 
> "Wylie plays strings and has a beautiful singing voice. She is attending her father's birthday party and won't be back for a couple of days. That leaves Embry, a talented composer and horn player; Mazia, who plays the flute; and Mytchyl, who plays the drums and the harpsichord.
> 
> "All the students are good-natured and kind."
^2a0

#### A Typical Day

If the characters request information about how the conservatory's occupants spend a typical day, Mackerel and Trout share the information in the Conservatory Schedule table.

**Conservatory Schedule**

| Start Time | Activity |
|------------|----------|
| 8 a.m. | Breakfast is served in the dining hall (area C1) on level 1. |
| 9 a.m. | Sythian supervises rehearsals in the music hall (area C11) on level 3 while the servants work and Joster lazes about. |
| Noon | Lunch is served in the dining hall (area C1). |
| 1 p.m. | A courier drops off Sythian's mail, which he reads in his study (area C14) on level 3, with Joster present, while the students relax in the gallery (area C4) on level 1. |
| 5 p.m. | Dinner is served in the dining hall (area C1). |
| 6 p.m. | The students practice their music unsupervised, either in their quarters (area C7) on level 2 or in the music hall (area C11). Sythian writes letters in his study (area C14) or prays in the shrine (area C5) on level 1, usually with Joster present. |
| 9 p.m. | Sythian, Joster, and the students gather in the dining hall (area C1) to tell stories, share city gossip, snack, and discuss music theory. |
| Midnight | Sythian, Joster, and the students retire to their quarters (Joster and the students in area C7 on level 2, Sythian in area C15 on level 3) while the servants tidy up. |
^conservatory-schedule

## Skalderang Conservatory

When the characters are close enough to see the conservatory, describe the location as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You recognize Skalderang Conservatory at once: a brooding keep surrounded by rows of dead olive trees. A long, straight, cobblestone driveway in need of repair passes through the orchard on its way to the conservatory, forming a loop before the entrance. Where the driveway meets the main road, someone has posted a plain wooden sign that reads as follows:
> 
> "Skalderang Conservatory—School for the Musically Gifted. No Tours! No Solicitors! No Amateurs!"
^2a3

The earth throughout the orchard is saturated with demon ichor, which killed the olive trees. A character who takes a minute to examine the earth and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check can determine that the ground is saturated with a putrid, oily substance not found in nature. A character who gets a 20 or higher on the check identifies the substance as demon ichor.

If the characters tell Sythian that his orchard was poisoned with demon ichor, he concludes [Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md) is responsible but keeps his suspicions to himself. The revelation makes Sythian bitter toward the incubus and poisons their long-term relationship.

### General Features

Skalderang Conservatory has stone walls and a stone-tiled ground floor. The upper floors have polished mahogany floors and wainscoting. Other prevalent features are summarized in the sections that follow.

#### Chimneys

The conservatory's chimneys haven't been cleaned in a long time. A Small character can try to squeeze up or down one, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. A failed check indicates that the character makes no progress. To enter or exit a chimney from the top, one must first use an action to try to remove the chimney's stone cap, doing so with a successful DC 18 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A character in gaseous form can navigate a chimney without having to make these checks or remove the chimney cap.

#### Doors

The conservatory's doors are made of thick, sturdy oak with iron fixtures. Locked doors are noted in their area's heading and require a master key to open. Sythian has one master key; Vordell, the housekeeper, has another. A character can take an action to try to pick a lock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check.

#### Elevator

A 5-foot-wide cage elevator fitted with stained-glass windows connects the dining hall on level 1 (area C1) to the mezzanine on level 2 (area C6) and the hallway on level 3 (area C13). The elevator is powered by magic. A creature in the elevator need only say "level 1," "level 2," or "level 3" in Common, and the elevator will ascend or descend to that floor, clattering noisily and taking about 6 seconds to move from one floor to the next. The elevator doesn't respond to commands while it is moving.

#### Exterior Lighting

The conservatory's exterior walls are lit up at night by golden [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells spaced evenly around the building's foundation. These spells are suppressed during daylight hours.

#### Interior Lighting

Natural light illuminates most of the conservatory's interior spaces. Students and servants who lack [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) use candles, lamps, or lit fireplaces to see at night.

#### Windows

The conservatory's windows are 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide, their lead frames fitted with dozens of small, diamond-shaped panes of frosted glass. Each window has small hinges on one side of it, allowing it to be swung open like a door. All windows are latched shut from the inside except on hot days. As an action, a character can try to force open a latched window, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, or use thieves' tools to unlatch a window from the outside, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

### Inhabitants

[Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) is described at the end of the adventure. His muse, the [incubus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) [Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md), clings to him like a shadow and uses telepathy to communicate secretly with him. The conservatory's other regular inhabitants are described below.

#### Demons

[Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md) petitioned and received aid from Graz'zt in the form of one [chasme](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) and six [quasits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md):

- **Chasme.** This Large demon crawls around the outside of the conservatory and is usually encountered on the rooftop (area C18). It attacks enemies it detects in the air, on the ground, or on the third-floor balcony (area C12).  
- **Quasits.** These Tiny demons haunt the conservatory, where they remain [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) or take the forms of bats and giant centipedes.  

Sythian and Joster are the only ones at the conservatory who are aware of the demons' presence, as the demons take care to hide themselves from students, servants, and most visitors. When a demon dies, it dissolves into a puddle of putrid ichor.

### Students

Sythian has opened his home to four students:

**Embry Hale** (chaotic good) is a loud, 17-year-old human who plays a mean horn. He also composes his own songs and lyrics, recording them on scraps of parchment. He plans to become an adventuring bard but hasn't the courage to tell his parents, who would never tolerate such a pedestrian, dangerous life for their son.

**Mazia Foulard** (lawful good) is a 20-year-old tiefling who has taught the other students a sign language she and her deaf grandmother created together. Mazia can play several instruments, but her favorite is the flute. She doesn't think Sythian is a particularly good teacher but has great love and respect for her fellow students.

**Mytchyl Dwyer** (neutral good) is a 13-year-old human who was born without legs. He gets around in a gold-trimmed wheelchair. When it comes to music, his lack of discipline prompted his parents to send him to the Skalderang Conservatory. He was unhappy at first, but he warmed to the company of the other students and secretly idolizes Embry.

**Wylie van Timmel** (lawful good) is a 16-year-old human who comes from a loving home and enjoys a life of privilege. Great things are expected of her, and she intends to make a name for herself. She is absent when the characters arrive and won't return for a couple days.

Should their statistics become necessary, the students are unarmed and unarmored [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) with an extra skill: [Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance) [Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance) (+7). The students are friendly but scream loudly and try to hide if confronted by unidentified intruders. They refuse to cooperate with anyone opposed to Sythian until his true colors are revealed to them.

Embry, Mazia, and Mytchyl saw the halflings Mackerel and Trout deliver a mandolin to Sythian, and they know what Sythian plans to do with it. They assume he procured the instrument legally and are unaware that it was stolen from a grave. Should they learn about the grave robbery, the three students instruct the housekeeper to pack up their belongings, and they leave the conservatory at once.

Sythian can't afford to lose his students, so if the characters threaten to tell the students about his grave robbing or the fact that he consorts with demons, he surrenders the instrument to ensure the characters' silence.

### Servants

Sythian employs two full-time servants, both [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md):

**Merle** (lawful good) is an 83-year-old dwarf cook. He has a neatly trimmed beard and a cheerful disposition. He doesn't socialize with the students much except to crack jokes. Merle has been a fixture in Skalderang Conservatory since before Sythian was born and doesn't have an unkind word to say about anybody except for [Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md), whom he suspects is up to no good.

**Vordell** (lawful neutral) is a dour, 50-year-old human housekeeper with a full head of salt-and-pepper hair pulled into a ponytail. He carries a master key that opens all locked doors in the conservatory. If he could find employment elsewhere, Vordell would abandon Sythian in a heartbeat. Vordell doesn't like that Sythian partakes in demon worship but keeps his misgivings to himself. Joster's [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) quasits torment Vordell by soiling or breaking things, which Vordell must then tidy up. Vordell doesn't know who or what to blame for these unexplained messes.

The servants are indifferent toward guests and hostile toward burglars. Duty and loyalty prevent them from cooperating with intruders willingly.

### The Direct Approach

Although he doesn't like unexpected guests, Sythian has enough grace to briefly entertain visitors who arrive at the conservatory without an appointment. Characters who knock on the front door or otherwise announce their presence are greeted by Vordell or one of the students and led by that individual into area C1, where the characters are expected to wait until Sythian and Joster arrive to question them. Should this encounter occur at night, Sythian is doubly annoyed by the disturbance, and Charisma checks made to influence him have disadvantage.

#### "Are You Accepting New Students?"

A character who is a bard (or pretends to be one) can petition Sythian to become a student at Skalderang Conservatory. The character must first prove they can afford Sythian's tutelage (by displaying treasure worth 250 gp or more), after which the character must impress Sythian by playing a musical instrument and succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma ([Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check. On a failed check, Sythian delivers a scathing critique of the character's musical ability before sending the characters away empty-handed. Sythian changes his mind if the characters pay him a bribe of 500 gp or more. On a successful check or upon receiving such a bribe, Sythian allows the would-be student (and only that character) to stay overnight and orders Vordell to prepare a room for them (area C7d).

> [!note] Where's the Mandolin?
> 
> Golden Axe is in Sythian's quarters (area C15). If you're running this adventure for one or more players who have played through the adventure before, you might move the mandolin to a different location in the conservatory.
^wheres-the-mandolin

#### "Surrender the Mandolin or Else!"

If the characters use their audience with Sythian to demand that Golden Axe be handed over to them, Sythian lets out a haughty laugh and orders the characters to leave at once. If the characters refuse, Sythian and Joster flee to area C15, where Sythian equips himself with [Golden Axe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.md) and tries to escape out the window using the mandolin's [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md) spell while Joster makes his own escape.

#### "We're Debt Collectors."

Sythian owes money to various loan sharks and banks. Characters who claim to represent one of these individuals or institutions must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to convince Sythian that they are who they say they are. If one or more characters fail this check, Sythian becomes suspicious (see "Sythian's Suspicion" below).

If the characters trick Sythian into believing they are debt collectors and demand a payment of no more than 200 gp, Sythian fetches the sum from his study (area C14) while Joster keeps a watchful eye on the characters. After making the payment, Sythian sends the characters on their way. If the characters demand more than 200 gp or anything other than coins, Sythian becomes suspicious (see below).

##### Sythian's Suspicion

If Sythian becomes suspicious of characters posing as debt collectors, he entertains them long enough for Joster to "fetch the payment." The incubus rounds up the demons in areas C4, C11, and C18 before returning to dispose of the visitors. When combat erupts, Sythian retreats to his bedroom (area C15) and grabs [Golden Axe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.md). If the characters catch up to him, he tries to escape out the window using the mandolin's [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md) spell.

### Conservatory Locations

The following locations are keyed to Skalderang Conservatory as shown on map 7.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 7.2: DM's Map](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/054-map-7-02-dms-map.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/055-map-7-02-dms-map-player.webp#gallery)

#### C1: Dining Hall

At night, the double door to the south is barred shut from the inside.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large dining table stands in the middle of this hall, surrounded by tall-backed wooden chairs. Suspended above the table are two chandeliers fitted with wax candles. Encircling the hall at a height of fifteen feet is a wooden mezzanine that can be reached by a cage elevator in one corner. West of the dining room is a cozy niche with a fireplace, three padded chairs, and a sideboard. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a framed portrait of two stern, well-dressed, middle-aged tieflings: a short, pudgy fellow and a tall, thin woman. The surrounding walls bear numerous smaller paintings, mostly of young people.
^2b7

During the day, characters are most likely to encounter Vordell, the housekeeper ([commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), here, setting the table or returning clean dishes and cutlery to the sideboard. Depending on the time of day, the characters might find [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) (see the end of the adventure), Joster the [incubus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) in tiefling form, and students here as well (see the Conservatory Schedule table).

##### Chandeliers

Simple rope-and-pulley mechanisms allow the chandeliers to be raised or lowered from the mezzanine (area C6).

##### Paintings

The painting above the mantelpiece depicts [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md)'s parents, Vexxis and Alyrria. The smaller portraits in the room were painted by Joster and depict Sythian's students, past and present.

#### C2: Kitchen and Pantry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large pot hangs in the fireplace of this cluttered kitchen, and stout worktables sized for a dwarf are covered with handy implements. A closet pantry stands in the corner next to a door that leads outside.
^2bb

Merle, the dwarf cook ([commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), works here from 6 a.m. to midnight. When confronted with danger, he grabs a rolling pin (treat it as a [club](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/club.md)) and defends himself.

The door that leads outside is used mainly for food deliveries and is barred shut from the inside at night.

#### C3: Servants' Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room contains three two-level bunk beds, one of which is currently in use. A washbasin stands in a nearby corner.
^2bd

Merle, the cook, claims the lower bunk as his. Vordell, the housekeeper, sleeps in the bunk above him.

##### Treasure

Each servant has a footlocker that contains personal effects and earnings. Characters who empty the two footlockers find a total of 8 gp, 55 sp, and 62 cp. Merle's footlocker also contains an ivory smoking pipe (25 gp), an electrum-framed hand mirror (25 gp), and a small pair of silvered shears (10 gp) he uses to trim his beard.

#### C4: Gallery

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several padded armchairs are arranged in this narrow chamber, the walls of which are festooned with hunting trophies and crossbows. Bare hooks and pale rectangles mark places on the walls where paintings once hung. Standing in the southwest corner near a single door is a stuffed wolf, its glassy gaze fixed on a stone staircase going up.
^2c0

Between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Sythian's students relax here. Three [quasits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) lurk by the stuffed wolf and use their Invisibility action to remain unseen. They attack characters who try to break into area C5.

The missing paintings were sold at auctions to pay off some of Sythian's debts. The remaining decor includes three [light crossbows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/light-crossbow.md) and three [heavy crossbows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/heavy-crossbow.md) (all of which are functional but missing ammunition) mounted on the walls, as well as a stag's head mounted above a fireplace.

![Joster Mareet conspires wi...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/056-07-004-quasit-conspiracy.webp#center "Joster Mareet conspires with three quasits, including one in centipede form and one in bat form")

#### C5: Shrine (Locked)

Students and guests are not allowed in this room, which is why Sythian locks the door.

Sythian's father, Vexxis, worshiped gods of the hunt and the harvest. When he died, this room fell into disuse until [Joster Mareet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/joster-mareet-kftgv.md) showed up and convinced Sythian to empty it and repurpose the shrine for the worship of Graz'zt. Vordell, the housekeeper, is the only person besides Sythian and Joster who's allowed to enter this area.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Dark curtains cover the windows of this room, which looks like it might have been a chapel, though most of the decor is gone, leaving empty niches and pedestals. A demonic stone hand rises from the floor and clutches a three-foot-tall, three-foot-wide brazier. The hand has five fingers instead of four.
^2c2

The stone hand merges seamlessly with the stone floor. Spilling a few drops of Humanoid blood into the brazier causes the brazier's coals to produce a hissing purple flame and oily, purplish smoke that reeks of offal. When Sythian summons the flame and speaks to it, the flame responds to him in Graz'zt's whispered voice, but only when the demon lord is in the mood to talk.

A character who examines the brazier and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check realizes that it's used by worshipers of Graz'zt to commune with the demon lord, who requires a blood sacrifice. As an action, a character can spill some of their own blood into the bowl and utter a prayer to Graz'zt; doing so has a 10 percent chance of annoying the demon lord, who causes four [shadow demons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/shadow-demon.md) to appear in the room and attack. These demons return to the Abyss after 10 minutes and disappear instantly when slain. (Graz'zt speaks only to those he considers worthy of his attention; the characters don't qualify in this regard.)

#### C6: Mezzanine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This wooden mezzanine encircles the dining hall at a height of fifteen feet, and the ceiling is fifteen feet higher still. Two chandeliers hang from ropes, the ends of which are wrapped around hooks bolted to the railing—one to the north, the other to the south.
^2c4

The mezzanine creaks loudly when stepped on. Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to cross the mezzanine quietly have disadvantage.

#### C7: Students' Quarters

Students sometimes practice music in their rooms from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. All students can be found in their rooms from midnight until shortly before 8 a.m. (see the Conservatory Schedule table).

Each of these rooms contains a single bed, a dresser, a washbasin, a chamber pot, and an iron stove with clawed feet with a stovepipe that funnels smoke into the nearby chimney. A mirror is mounted on the inside of the door. Other features of each room are summarized below:

- **C7a.** Wylie's Room. Resting on the dresser is a wooden case containing a beautifully crafted lyre (250 gp) that belongs to Wylie van Timmel.  
- **C7b.** Joster's Room. Joster has claimed this vacant room for himself and uses it primarily as a studio to paint portraits of new students. (These paintings end up on the walls in area C1.) A wooden easel stands near the window, and a collection of paints and brushes rests on the windowsill. Leaning against the base of the easel are three blank canvases stretched over wooden frames.  
- **C7c.** Mytchyl's Room. When present, Mytchyl Dwyer lies on his bed with his wheelchair close by. Mounted on the wall above the headboard are three songbirds carved from driftwood.  
- **C7d.** Spare Room. No one uses this room currently.  
- **C7e.** Mazia's Room. Mazia Foulard keeps a diary and a small leather case tucked under her pillow. The case contains an exquisitely crafted silver flute (250 gp) that was given to Mazia by her grandmother.  
- **C7f.** Embry's Room. Odors waft into this room from the kitchen. Embry Hale has a framed painting on one wall that depicts the silhouette of a satyr playing a trumpet (25 gp). Tucked under Embry's mattress is a wooden smoking pipe and packet of pipe tobacco.  

#### C8: Bathroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Dry towels are stacked on a shelf above a row of empty hooks by the door. Protruding from the far wall is a funnel-shaped shower head, below which is an iron knob.
^2c7

The servants shower here every night after finishing their chores, while students shower here before breakfast each morning.

Turning the iron knob causes hot water to spring from the shower head. The water, which is produced magically, disappears through drains in the floor.

#### C9: Sythian's Bathroom (Locked)

Sythian showers here every morning before breakfast. This room is otherwise identical to area C8.

#### C10: Laundry Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The window of this room is opened a crack to let in fresh air. Damp towels and clothing hang on wooden racks, and a washtub with a scrubbing board rests under a spigot that protrudes from one wall, near a shelf lined with bars of soap.
^2ca

Turning the spigot on the wall causes hot water, which is produced magically, to flow from a faucet and into the washtub, which has a drain plug in the bottom of it.

#### C11: Music Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This spacious room contains several large instruments, including a harp, a harpsichord, a piano, a cello, and three kettle drums. More portable instruments—such as fiddles, ukuleles, accordions, bagpipes, lutes, lyres, oboes, brass horns, bongos, and violins—rest on padded chairs spaced evenly around the perimeter. Eight rectangular, stained-glass skylights give the chamber a cathedral-like aspect. The room's three double doors have built-in, hand-carved panels depicting scenes of dancing and merrymaking.
^2cc

[Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) (see the end of the adventure) is here with his students from 9 a.m. to noon. The students often return to this room between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. to play music without supervision.

Three [quasits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) lurk under chairs, using their Invisibility action to hide. They attack any intruder who picks up or plays one of the instruments.

##### Instruments

Sythian could pay off most of his debts by selling his impressive collection of musical instruments, but he refuses to do so.

#### C12: Outdoor Balcony

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stone battlement encloses this balcony, which overlooks the main entrance.
^2cf

The [chasme](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) on the rooftop (area C18) creeps down the exterior wall to attack characters on this balcony. It's a 30-foot drop from the balcony to the ground.

#### C13: Hallway

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Standing in an alcove at the north end of this hallway is an empty suit of armor, its vacant helm staring past the cage elevator toward the double door at the opposite end of the hall.
^2d1

The elevator climbs no higher than this hallway.

##### Trapped Secret Door

A secret door disguised to look like a section of wood-paneled wall is hidden behind the suit of armor. A character can detect the secret door by searching the wall and succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. A successful check also reveals a faint glyph on the secret door—the telltale sign of a [glyph of warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) spell. Only Sythian can open the door without triggering the glyph. When the glyph triggers, each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the suit of armor suffers the effect of a [shatter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shatter.md) spell (save DC 14). The spell also causes the suit of armor to fall to pieces and alerts Sythian and Joster in area C15 if they are there. Once the spell goes off, the secret door is no longer trapped.

The secret door is unlocked and leads to area C14.

#### C14: Sythian's Study

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An unlocked rolltop desk is pushed against the west wall of this study. The desk's chair has a large S carved into its backrest. Near the desk, a wooden staircase spirals up.
^2d4

Between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., [Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) (see the end of the adventure) is here, reading and writing letters, as well as reviewing applications from the families of young hopefuls who seek to benefit from his tutelage. While Sythian is here, Joster the [incubus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) reverts to his true form and looms over Sythian's shoulder.

##### Treasure

The desk is stuffed with quills, [ink jars](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ink-1-ounce-bottle.md), [candles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/candle.md), [wax seals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sealing-wax.md), and [sheets of parchment](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/parchment-one-sheet.md). A thorough search of the desk takes 1 minute and yields a small wooden coffer containing 270 gp, 165 sp, and 89 cp.

#### C15: Sythian's Quarters (Locked)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room contains a canopied bed and other furnishings, including a corner fireplace flanked by stone-carved hunting mastiffs. A large trunk rests at the foot of the bed.
^2d7

![Canaith Mandolin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/057-07-005-canaith-mandolin.webp#center)

[Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) (see the end of the adventure) is here from midnight until 8 a.m.

##### Trapped Trunk

A character who examines the trunk and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check detects a faint glyph on its lid—the telltale sign of a [glyph of warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) spell. The first time a creature other than Sythian opens the trunk, the spell goes off, targeting the creature that opened the trunk with a [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md) spell (save DC 14). On a successful saving throw, the creature resists the spell. On a failed saving throw, the creature is compelled to leave the room empty-handed and not return for 8 hours (the duration of the spell). Once the glyph is triggered, the trunk is safe to open.

##### Treasure

The trunk contains, among personal items and clothing of little value, the [instrument of the bards (Canaith mandolin)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.md) stolen from Froderic Dartwild's grave.

#### C16: Attic

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Gray sheets cover old furniture in this dusty attic.
^2db

Characters who spend at least 1 minute searching the attic find two life-sized wooden mannequins—one wearing a green wedding dress, the other a white funeral dress. Both dresses belonged to Sythian's mother. They also find a wooden chest that is padlocked; the key is lost, but a character can take an action to try to pick the lock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check.

##### Treasure

Inside the padlocked chest, wrapped in leather, is a flat wooden case whose lid is engraved with a pair of stags locking horns. The case contains six [+2 crossbow bolts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-ammunition.md). Sythian is unaware of these items and won't miss them if someone takes them.

#### C17: Library (Locked)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Empty bookshelves stand between the windows of this musty tower attic.
^2de

Sythian sold his family's collection of books to pay off debts. A locked door leads to the rooftop (area C18).

#### C18: Rooftop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A three-foot-high stone battlement encloses this rooftop. Mounted on one corner of the battlement is a flagpole flying a black pennant emblazoned with a golden olive tree. A chimney pipe juts from the opposite corner, and an oak door leads to each tower.
> 
> A five-foot-wide walkway wraps around a convex structure composed of eight large stained-glass windows in lead frames. Each skylight is a work of art, its panes shaped and colored to resemble a rising or setting sun.
^2e0

It's a 45-foot drop from the rooftop to the ground.

Unless it has been fought and killed elsewhere, a [chasme](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) guards this area. At your discretion, the demon might be perched above a doorway, waiting to ambush intruders emerging from one of the towers.

##### Flagpole

The flagpole in the southwest corner is made of metal and is sturdy enough to bear the weight of characters who wish to lower themselves down a wall or through a skylight.

##### Skylights

There are eight skylights, each one a Large object with AC 13, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Rather than shattering an entire skylight, a character can take an action to break or pry out one of a skylight's panes, creating a hole big enough to slip through. It's a 15-foot drop from the skylights to the floor of area C11.

### Leaving Post-Heist

If the characters leave the conservatory with Golden Axe and the [chasme](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) in area C18 is still alive, the demon swoops down and attacks the characters before they get too far. The demon's goal is to return the mandolin to the conservatory. The mandolin is, after all, Sythian's ticket to earning the patronage of Wylie van Timmel's family.

You can make this final encounter deadlier by adding either a second [chasme](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) or a [barlgura](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md).

## Conclusion

Once Golden Axe is safely in their possession, the characters must decide whether to keep it for themselves (in which case the adventure ends here) or return it to its rightful owner (see "Buried Again" below).

### Buried Again

If Golden Axe is returned to [Frody Dartwild](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/frody-dartwild-kftgv.md), read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Froderic Dartwild plucks the strings of the mandolin and plays a happy tune. Meanwhile, the news of your return spreads through Toadhop like wildfire. Everyone comes out to greet you, including Honorary Mayor Jenna Bean, who snorts contentedly. Frody apologizes to everyone for the trouble he has caused and says he looks forward to returning to his grave. His words bring tears as well as cheers.
^2e6

A local carpenter named Lewth Fulchre (the father of local rabblerouser Ebbin Fulchre) offers to repair Frody's coffin, which shouldn't take more than a few hours. While Frody waits, he performs his favorite music to an enrapt crowd outside My Left Boot. If there's a bard or another musically inclined individual among the player characters, Frody suggests they perform together as a duet. If the character agrees, award them inspiration.

Everyone in Toadhop attends Frody's second funeral, which you can summarize as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After Frody is returned to the earth, Toadhop's residents stand around his grave wearing straw hats—a local custom, you reckon—to sing a somber hymn. A little girl lays a tiny flower on the dead bard's grave before returning to the arms of her weeping parents. As the crowd disperses, locals pat you on the back and shoulder and congratulate you on a quest well done.
^2e7

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, a representative of the organization offers the characters a rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment for returning the Canaith mandolin to Frody. The reward is delivered to the characters a day or two after Frody's reburial.

## Sythian Skalderang

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/058-07-006-sithian-skalderang.webp#center)

[Sythian Skalderang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sythian-skalderang-kftgv.md) has been blessed by the demon lord [Graz'zt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grazzt-mpmm.md). Graz'zt's gift to Sythian manifests in several ways, including Sythian's ability to conjure demonic whispers that can fray enemy minds.

When he was a young boy, Sythian went on a hunting trip with his father. A [giant toad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-toad.md) attacked them and swallowed Sythian. Although Sythian escaped after his father slew the monster, the attack left Sythian with an acute fear of frogs and toads.

Sythian's parents hoped his interest in music would lead Sythian to become an extraordinary musician; he became a mediocre one instead, despite the help of several renowned tutors. Years later, Sythian resents their efforts, as the money his parents lavished on his education left him with many unpaid debts. Now that his parents are dead, he is determined to hold on to his estate and will do whatever it takes to keep what he has left.

Sythian has attuned to Golden Axe so that he can learn and exercise the [Canaith mandolin's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-canaith-mandolin.md) properties. Although he hopes Golden Axe will earn him the good graces and financial support of the van Timmels, Sythian would sooner lose the instrument than see any harm befall his students, as his reputation and financial success hinge on their well-being. He gladly gives up the instrument to save himself.

Sythian is an impatient and demanding teacher who holds his students to a rigorous schedule. His bone conductor's wand doubles as a spellcasting focus.

# Party at Paliset Hall
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault, p. 177* 

*An Adventure for 10th-Level Characters*

Every year during the winter solstice, [Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md) holds a grand gala in Paliset Hall, her palatial retreat in the Feywild. The characters are hired to infiltrate the gala and steal Zorhanna's [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), a magical diamond with peculiar properties. As the evening unfolds, they learn that nothing is quite what it seems.

## Adventure Background

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/090-12-002-ch12-key.webp#center)

Lady [Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md) is an elf and a retired adventurer. On one of her many adventures, she stole a diamond [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) (a magic item described at the end of the adventure) from a trio of night hags known as the Crestfall Coven. Zorhanna later mounted the diamond into a glittering platinum necklace, which she often wears during special occasions. Trapped within the iridescent facets of the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) is an unstable extradimensional rift that gives the diamond its remarkable powers.

Every year during the winter solstice, Zorhanna and her husband, a werebear tinkerer named Eliphas, withdraw to their Feywild home of Paliset Hall to throw a lavish gala. Many guests from the Material Plane and the Feywild attend this pleasant gathering. This year, Zorhanna plans to show off her [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace once again, unaware that forces are conspiring to steal it from her.

### Far Realm Invader

Some time ago, a malevolent entity from the Far Realm found a way into the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) through the extradimensional rift contained inside it. Since then, this bodiless entity has been trapped in the stone—but it won't be for much longer. The entity's presence is weakening the stone, and when the diamond finally cracks, the effects could be catastrophic.

A few days ago, unaware of the danger, Zorhanna donned the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace to see how it looked with a new gown she planned to wear at the gala. Zorhanna's close contact with the necklace allowed the Far Realm entity to trap her inside the diamond. The entity then replaced Zorhanna with a simulacrum using one of the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md)'s magical properties. [Zorhanna's simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhannas-simulacrum-kftgv.md) now wanders Paliset Hall, preparing for the arrival of the gala's guests, while the real Zorhanna remains trapped inside the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md).

### Stealing the Shard Solitaire

The characters become embroiled in this story after Eliphas, suspicious of the simulacrum's behavior, sends a friendly satyr named Fifel to get help. Fifel gives the characters invitations to the gala and reads a letter from Eliphas, urging them to steal the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace from Zorhanna and take it far from Paliset Hall.

An added complication occurs toward the end of the adventure, as the hags of the Crestfall Coven crash the gala and attempt to reclaim that which was stolen from them. The hags know nothing about the Far Realm entity or [Zorhanna's simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhannas-simulacrum-kftgv.md), but they have their own clever plan to steal the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md)—a plan the characters can turn to their advantage, if all else fails.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open the music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Greetings, operatives. A magical diamond called a shard solitaire is known to contain an unstable extradimensional rift. Its owner, [Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md), is a retired adventurer. Her husband, Eliphas, used to work for the Golden Vault. He suspects that an evil force has somehow entered the stone and is using it to control Zorhanna. He has asked the Golden Vault to steal the stone from Paliset Hall, where he and Zorhanna host their annual gala celebrating the winter solstice.
> 
> "This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to obtain the shard solitaire without harming Zorhanna, Eliphas, or their guests. You will be approached shortly by a messenger named Fifel, who has your invitations to the gala and directions to Paliset Hall, which is in the Feywild. Good luck, operatives."
^455

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

## Meeting Fifel

The adventure begins in earnest when the characters meet Fifel, a [satyr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) who works for [Eliphas Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md). Where Fifel appears is up to you. You can use the following boxed text to describe what he looks like:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Fifel is a lanky satyr with dark curly hair pulled into a small bun and golden eyes alight with excitement. He wears a maroon tunic, over which are slung various belts and bulging leather pouches. Rolled tubes of parchment jut from his haversack, and his pockets jingle and clank as he walks. "Salutations!" he says with a clumsy salute.
^457

Fifel carries a [Heward's handy haversack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hewards-handy-haversack.md), in which he stores various documents. The satyr is a bit scatterbrained, but Eliphas trusts him to run errands and deliver important messages.

From his haversack, Fifel produces a handful of invitations and hands one to each character. Each invitation is contained in a pale-blue envelope that is cool to the touch and smells like a crisp winter morning. The invitations read as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Zorhanna and [Eliphas Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md) request the pleasure of your company at Paliset Hall to celebrate the arrival of the winter solstice. Come to Loch Wynnis no earlier than three days before the winter solstice, then take the crossing there to the Feywild at sundown. The many splendors of Paliset Hall await you on the other side! Formal attire is expected but not required.
^458

A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an invisible watermark on the back of each invitation, which is used to verify its authenticity.

Once the invitations are distributed, Fifel uncorks a scroll tube with his teeth, then flips the tube upside-down and shakes it vigorously until a rolled-up sheet of parchment falls out. He picks up the parchment, unrolls it, and reads what's written on it in Common:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I, [Eliphas Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md), have sent my esteemed messenger, Fifel Amberhoof, to lead you to the shores of Loch Wynnis, so that you may cross into the Feywild with great haste. The winter solstice is nearly upon us, and I fear evil forces are as well.
> 
> "My wife, the archmage Zorhanna, has not been herself of late. I believe something or someone is controlling her through a magic diamond, which she acquired many years ago on one of her adventures. Zorhanna had it fitted into a necklace, which she wears on special occasions. A few days ago, she removed the necklace from our vault and wore it during a dress fitting. Since then, she has been uncharacteristically cruel to the household staff. When I confronted her, she dismissed me out of hand, clutched the necklace, and uttered something in a dreadful language I've never heard her speak before. All her warmth is gone. When I look into her eyes, I see a cold and spiteful woman staring back at me.
> 
> "I want you to steal the necklace, which Zorhanna now refuses to remove. I can't safely do it myself. Fifel will give you invitations to our winter solstice gala at Paliset Hall. There will be other guests to distract Zorhanna while you figure out a way to remove the necklace.
> 
> "Once we're rid of the necklace, Fifel will deliver your reward."
^459

Fifel can tell the characters that Eliphas is offering the following items as payment for their help:

- [Rust-colored bag of tricks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-tricks-rust.md)  
- [Figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-serpentine-owl.md)  
- [Gauntlets of ogre power](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gauntlets-of-ogre-power.md) or [quiver of Ehlonna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quiver-of-ehlonna.md) (characters' choice)  

These magic items are on display in Paliset Hall's art gallery (area P6).

If the characters accept the terms and agree to steal the necklace, Fifel leads them to Loch Wynnis, a lakeside hamlet with a fey crossing that serves as a gateway between the Material Plane and the Feywild (see the "Loch Wynnis" section for details). Fifel explains that the fey crossing works only seven days of the year: three days before the winter solstice, the day of the winter solstice, and three days after the winter solstice.

## Planning the Heist

As they travel to Loch Wynnis in the company of Fifel, the characters can ask the satyr for information about the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), the Adulares, the winter solstice gala, and Paliset Hall.

### Shard Solitaire Lore

Fifel knows the following information about the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md):

- **Origin Story.** Fifel thinks the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) formed when someone dropped a [Heward's handy haversack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hewards-handy-haversack.md) full of jewels into a [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md), creating an explosive portal to the Astral Plane. One of the jewels absorbed some of the portal's volatile energy to become the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md). (See "Secrets of the Shard Solitaire" at the end of the adventure for what really happened.)  
- **Previous Owners.** When she was an adventurer many years ago, Zorhanna stole the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) from a trio of night hags known as the Crestfall Coven. She never encountered the hags again, to the best of Fifel's knowledge.  
- **Safeguard.** Zorhanna paid a master jeweler to craft a platinum necklace and attach the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) to it. If it is removed from Zorhanna's neck, the necklace automatically teleports to a secret vault in Paliset Hall. The vault is located somewhere in Zorhanna's bedchamber on the second floor. (Fifel is wrong about the vault's location.) The necklace doesn't teleport if it's removed from the vault, so stealing it requires that it be taken from that location.  

### The Adulares

Fifel knows the following information about Zorhanna and [Eliphas Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md):

- **Zorhanna's Past.** Zorhanna had a long and successful adventuring career before she settled down and married Eliphas. During one of Zorhanna's adventures, she befriended an archfey who, years later, built Paliset Hall and bequeathed it to Zorhanna. Rumor has it the archfey was the Prince of Frost.  
- **Eliphas's Past.** Eliphas is a gentleman and a tinkerer. (Fifel doesn't reveal that Eliphas is a werebear.) For years, he offered his services to the Golden Vault, an organization dedicated to preserving historical relics and keeping powerful items out of evil hands. Eliphas designed the magical music boxes that the Golden Vault uses to communicate with its field operatives.  

### Winter Solstice Gala

Fifel knows the following information about the winter solstice gala hosted by Zorhanna and Eliphas:

- **Guests.** The Adulares have invited guests from the Feywild and the Material Plane. Feywild guests don't need to use the fey crossing in Loch Wynnis; instead, coaches pulled by unicorns will deliver them to the palace.  
- **Weapons and Armor.** Guests may bring weapons and wear armor as fashion accessories.  

### Map of Paliset Hall

If the characters ask him questions about the layout of Paliset Hall, Fifel sketches a rough map of the manor and gives it to them (see map 12.1).

![Map 12.1: Players' Map](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/091-12-003-player-map.webp#center)

## Loch Wynnis

Loch Wynnis is the name of both a deep lake and the hamlet next to it. The adventure assumes the characters arrive at Loch Wynnis shortly before sundown on the day of the winter solstice—just in time to attend the gala at Paliset Hall.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Nestled in the highlands is a quaint hamlet, its cottages and shops idyllically situated between a thick, snow-dusted evergreen forest and a dark lake with icy shores. A wharf stands where the village meets the water.
^460

For most of the year, the hamlet of Loch Wynnis has shuttered storefronts, too many empty tavern tables, and fewer than two dozen permanent residents. As midwinter approaches, the town's population balloons with seasonal merchants and visitors eager to glimpse Loch Wynnis's magical marvel: the opening of the fey crossing in the lake. The crossing opens briefly at sundown the day of the winter solstice, the three days before, and the three days after it.

### People of Loch Wynnis

Residents of Loch Wynnis know of the winter solstice festivities that occur at Paliset Hall in the Feywild, even though few of these residents are invited to participate. Most are content to stay on the Material Plane side of the fey crossing, selling goods and services to passing tourists. The Adulares and their servants are known to the villagers, all of whom Fifel knows by name. Fifel encourages the characters to briefly tour the hamlet before heading to the lake by sundown.

### Other Gala Attendees

As the characters pass through the village, they may encounter other gala invitees waiting anxiously for the fey crossing to appear at sundown. You can use the Gala Guests table to generate random NPCs for the characters to meet. These NPCs don't wear armor or carry weapons, but every gala attendee has an invitation like the ones Fifel gave to the adventurers.

**Gala Guests**

`dice: [](13-party-at-paliset-hall.md#^gala-guests)`

| dice: d8 | Guest |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Kaden Lannis is a lonely human [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) in his twenties. He hopes to find true love in the Feywild. |
| 2 | Verano Honeywell is a halfling [spy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) employed by a big-city broadsheet to attend the gala and write a story about the goings-on in Paliset Hall. |
| 3 | Lycoris, a [dryad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad.md), was Paliset Hall's head of staff until she retired six years ago. She comes to the gala every year to see her old friends, and she knows Paliset Hall's features and staff supremely well. |
| 4 | Berengar is a [werebear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/werebear.md) and [Eliphas Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md)'s longtime friend. Eliphas is the only other person at the gala who knows Berengar is a werebear. Berengar likewise knows that Eliphas is a werebear. |
| 5 | Nix, a gnome [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), was Zorhanna's apprentice for several years. Nix has agreed to look after Paliset Hall once the gala ends and the Adulares return to the Material Plane. Nix plans to stay until the next winter solstice. |
| 6 | Eggsy, a gnome [bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md), plans to pick some pockets at the gala. He attends under a false name ("Dworp Q. Guzzler, Esq., Gnome Adventurer") and has altered his appearance using a disguise kit. His disguise includes a curly wig, a more pronounced chin, copper-wired spectacles, and a fake beard. His invitation is a well-crafted forgery, including a fake invisible watermark on the back. Exposing it as a forgery requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. |
| 7 | Yalara is an elf [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) and singer whose music troupe was invited to perform at the gala. The other two members of her troupe were unable to make it to Loch Wynnis in time. |
| 8 | Mettle, an unarmed tiefling [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) with horn-rimmed spectacles, pretends to be a noble named Adira and secretly works for the hags of the Crestfall Coven (see "The Crestfall Coven" later in the adventure). Upon arriving in the Feywild, Mettle slips a copper ring onto the third finger of her left hand. Affixed to the ring is a hag eye, a varnished eyeball that enables the hags to see what's happening at the gala (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the "Monster Manual" for details about this item). |
^gala-guests

### Locations in Loch Wynnis

The following locations are points of interest for characters who explore the hamlet of Loch Wynnis.

#### Auberge Aurore

*Tavern and Inn*

Wintertime visitors who don't have friends or family in the village stay in the Auberge Aurore while awaiting the solstice. When the characters arrive, the three-towered inn has two rooms available, each containing two beds. A bed costs 2 gp per night; a hot supper costs 1 sp.

The Auberge Aurore is owned and operated by Rei Paceran (neutral, elf [veteran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)), who is also the village's sheriff. Stern and unflappable, Rei has no patience for any misconduct under her watch. Rei is wary of the Feywild and has no interest in going there.

#### Khorr's Kloths

*Tailor and Dress Shop*

This small but vibrant fashion boutique is run by Khorr, a chaotic good [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md). Born from Khorr's frustration at being unable to find clothes that fit his frame, Khorr's shop has since gained a reputation as a source of untraditional and striking outfits for Humanoids of all shapes and statures.

If the characters need outfits for the gala, Khorr is happy to oblige. An exquisite ensemble from Khorr costs 20 gp. Individuals can also come to the bugbear for tailoring services, which cost 5 gp.

#### Loch Wynnis Docks

*Wharf*

A few rowboats are tethered to these wooden docks. Visitors and residents who like to fish are free to use them. A thin layer of ice has formed around the boats, but the ice breaks apart easily.

Most of the docks are 10 feet long, but one particularly old and creaky dock is 50 feet long. This dock extends into the lake and allows easy access to Loch Wynnis's fey crossing (see "Sundown Crossing" below).

### Fifel Takes His Leave

Eliphas gave Fifel strict orders not to return to Paliset Hall (for the satyr's safety) until the matter concerning the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace is resolved. When the characters are ready to head to the lake, Fifel says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "My friends, here is where I take my leave. By my good lord's orders, I shall remain at the Auberge Aurore and await your return."
^468

Fifel gives the characters a quick salute before skipping toward the tavern.

## Sundown Crossing

Gala guests assemble at the docks shortly before sundown. As the sun sets, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> When the last sliver of sun dips below the horizon, a silver glow emanates from deep within the water, and distant music and laughter drift through the air.
> 
> Two wolves as big as horses materialize out of thin air at the end of the dock. They have snow-white fur and eyes as cold and blue as glacial ice. As they walk slowly down the dock, one of them says in Common, "Honored guests, the lady and lord of Paliset Hall eagerly await your presence. Once your invitation has been validated, please walk to the end of the dock and jump in the water."
> 
> The other wolf reassures any first-time guests, "While Loch Wynnis's gateway is open, you will find the water neither cold nor wet."
^46a

The two [winter wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/winter-wolf.md) inspect every guest's invitation but are fooled by well-crafted forgeries. Each wolf can cast [see invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) on itself once per day, enabling it to see the invisible watermarks on the guests' invitations as well as to detect [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) party-crashers.

The wolves attack anyone caught trying to enter the Feywild without a validated invitation. When the last guest has crossed, the wolves return to Paliset Hall. If one or both wolves are killed, their failure to return is noticed by four more winter wolves on the Feywild side of the crossing (see area P1). These wolves recheck all invitations and attack anyone whose invitation fails a second inspection.

### Using the Fey Crossing

Anyone who steps off the end of the dock and into the lake while the fey crossing is open appears in the courtyard of Paliset Hall (area P1), on their feet and completely dry. The fey crossing closes 10 minutes after sundown, although it can be reopened from the other side as described in area P1.

## Paliset Hall

Paliset Hall is the winter palace of Zorhanna and [Eliphas Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md). It is situated in a peaceful meadow between snow-covered mountains and a mist-shrouded forest of evergreen trees. Winter's cool touch greets new arrivals, but there's no harsh wind.

Attempts by the Far Realm entity to escape from the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) have caused extraplanar energy to leak into Paliset Hall. This wayward energy has settled in the basement and is causing architectural anomalies to manifest briefly throughout the manor (see "General Features" below).

### General Features

Paliset Hall has the following features throughout:

- **Architectural Anomalies.** Unstable energy leaking from the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) is affecting Paliset Hall, causing areas to warp in appearance momentarily. Whenever one or more characters enter a new area of the manor, roll a `d6`. If you roll an odd number, the characters notice iridescent cracks crawling up the walls, followed by a sudden shift in the architecture: a square window becomes circular, a wood panel turns to stone, and the like. Immediately after, the cracks vanish, and the architecture returns to normal.  
- **Ceilings and Walls.** The ceilings and walls of the manor are 20 feet high and carved from alabaster stone that's cold to the touch.  
- **Decorations.** Wintery decorations festoon many areas of the palace. Crystal snowflakes hang in the windows, illusory icicles dangle from the ceiling, frost fractals spreads across walls, and magically preserved ice sculptures perch atop similarly preserved ice pedestals. Some of the ice sculptures are, in fact, ice mephits assigned to guard an area (as noted in the area's description).  
- **Doors.** Unless otherwise stated, the doors of the manor are open and unlocked.  
- **Lighting.** The rooms of the manor are brightly lit with [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells spaced evenly along the walls.  
- **Music.** Illusion magic creates jaunty music in the ballroom that can be heard throughout most of the palace—everywhere except the basement.  

### Zorhanna Adulare

The real Zorhanna is trapped inside the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), where she is under attack by the Far Realm entity trapped in there with her. Using the power of the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), the Far Realm entity has created a simulacrum of Zorhanna.

#### Zorhanna's Simulacrum

[Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md)'s simulacrum appears identical to Zorhanna: a tall elf with purple skin and long, pale hair. The simulacrum wears a silvery gown embroidered with crystalline ferns and carnelian holly berries. It proudly shows off the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) it's wearing to guests. Any character who observes the simulacrum for 1 minute can discern its cold indifference with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

Abilities such as [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#truesight) and magic that detects illusions reveal the true nature of the simulacrum: an elf made entirely of magical snow.

The [simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhannas-simulacrum-kftgv.md) uses the [archmage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) stat block, with these changes:

- The simulacrum is a neutral evil Construct.  
- It speaks Common, Draconic, Elvish, Gnomish, or Sylvan while pretending to be Zorhanna, or Deep Speech when it is angry or frustrated.  
- It can't regain expended spell slots or use the properties of the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace. (The [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) is currently attuned to the Far Realm entity trapped inside.)  
- If the simulacrum drops to 0 hit points, it turns to snow and melts away, and the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace teleports to the safe in Zorhanna's vault tower (area P12).  

#### Simulacrum's Location

To determine the location of [Zorhanna's simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhannas-simulacrum-kftgv.md) when the characters first arrive at Paliset Hall, or anytime the characters lose track of it and need to find it, roll a `d4` and consult the Simulacrum's Location table, or choose an option you like.

**Simulacrum's Location**

`dice: [](13-party-at-paliset-hall.md#^simulacrums-location)`

| dice: d4 | Location |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Dancing in the ballroom (area P4) |
| 2 | Relaxing in the parlor (area P5) |
| 3 | Mingling in the banquet hall (area P7) |
| 4 | Observing from the balcony (area P9) |
^simulacrums-location

### Stealing the Necklace

As an action, a character can try to steal the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace with a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, or a character can use a [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md) spell or similar magic to try to make the simulacrum relinquish the necklace. (Even though the simulacrum is a Construct, it can be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed).) The simulacrum becomes hostile toward anyone who tries to take the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md). The simulacrum doesn't care about collateral damage to Paliset Hall, its staff, or its guests.

The instant the necklace becomes separated from the simulacrum, the necklace teleports to the hidden vault in area P12. Eliphas knows where this vault is located, but only Zorhanna and her simulacrum know the proper way to open it.

### Paliset Hall Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 12.2.

#### P1: Fountain and Patio

The following description assumes the characters arrive here from Loch Wynnis via the fey crossing:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You stand in a fountain of illusory water on a cobblestone patio. Colorful globes of light bob in the air, dancing in time with the stars that blink on the twilit horizon. The patio leads to a grand, two-story palace, its walls as white as fresh-fallen snow. The dark roof shimmers with the colors of an aurora. Crystal snowflakes decorate the windows, and music wafts through the palace's open doorway.
> 
> Four winter wolves stand between you and Paliset Hall. After welcoming guests to the gala, the wolves insist on checking invitations once more before allowing anyone into the palace.
^474

![A gnome adventurer acquire...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/094-12-004-gnome-adventurer.webp#center "A gnome adventurer acquires the shard solitaire necklace and a key belonging to Paliset Hall's head of staff")

The four [winter wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/winter-wolf.md) are soon joined by the two [winter wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/winter-wolf.md) from Loch Wynnis. Each wolf can cast [see invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) on itself once per day, enabling it to see the invisible watermarks on the guests' invitations as well as detect [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) party-crashers. The wolves are forbidden from entering Paliset Hall without a command from Zorhanna or Eliphas. If someone tries to slip past the wolves, they alert the ice mephits in area P2, which attack the offender.

##### Fey Crossing

The fountain contains the fey crossing connected to Loch Wynnis. In addition to the few times when the fey crossing opens on its own, anyone can open the fey crossing from this side by reciting the rhyme, "Neither gleaming sword nor magic tome can soothe the soul like hearth and home." This rhyme is known to Zorhanna, Eliphas, the winter wolves, and Paliset Hall's staff. The fey crossing remains open for 10 minutes after the rhyme is recited.

Anyone who steps into the fountain while the fey crossing is open immediately appears, completely dry, on Loch Wynnis's longest dock at the end farthest from the shore.

##### Feywild Guests

The gala attracts not only folk from the Material Plane but guests from the Feywild as well. These guests (all of whom are dressed in fantastic, winter-themed outfits) arrive in coaches drawn by [unicorns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) and driven by [satyrs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md). Characters who linger on the patio might see one or more of these coaches arrive and deposit their guests.

#### P2: Foyer

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The front doors of the palace are made of stained glass with silvery fractal patterns. Garlands of frost wind around two spiral alabaster staircases in the grand foyer, and flakes of magical snow fall from the icicle-covered ceiling, disappearing as they touch the floor. Guests mill about, idly chatting.
^478

##### Guests

At any given time during the gala, `1d6` [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) loiter in the foyer. You can add a named guest to the foyer by rolling once on the Gala Guests table.

##### Ice Mephits

Six [ice mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/ice-mephit.md) are disguised as ice decorations along the perimeter of the room. The mephits attack anyone who starts a fight in this area. Only Zorhanna, her simulacrum, and Eliphas can command the mephits to stop attacking and return to their posts.

##### Staircases

Spiral staircases in the northern corners of the room lead to the upper floor and balcony (area P9).

#### P3: Coat Check

Guests can entrust their coats to the manor's head of staff, a gray-haired, upbeat [satyr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) named Oren. He carefully hangs the coats on hooks that line the west and east walls of this area between the foyer and the ballroom.

Oren is diplomatic and ingratiating without being obsequious. When confronted with turmoil, he does his best to maintain a calm facade.

##### Finding Zorhanna and Eliphas

Oren doesn't know where Zorhanna is, but characters who ask about Eliphas are told the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Lord Adulare wasn't feeling well and has withdrawn to the upstairs guest room for a trice. But pine not! I expect he'll rejoin us before long."
^47e

Oren senses trouble between Lord and Lady Adulare, but he won't pry into their affairs, and he gently discourages other staff from doing the same. He carries a key for the storage closets in the cellar (area P18) but doesn't recall anything important being stored in them.

#### P4: Ballroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A jaunty waltz draws you into this palatial ballroom. Above the dancing crowd spins a glittering chandelier that appears crafted from equal parts silver and frost. Icicles hang from the vaulted ceiling, sparkling in the light like jewels.
^480

A 20-foot-high balcony (area P9) overlooks the ballroom floor.

##### Guests

At any given time during the gala, `2d6 × 2` [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) dance here. You can add a named guest to the ballroom by rolling once on the Gala Guests table.

##### Ice Mephits

Six [ice mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/ice-mephit.md) are disguised as ice decorations along the perimeter of the room. The mephits attack anyone who starts a fight in this area. Only Zorhanna, her simulacrum, and Eliphas can command the mephits to stop attacking and return to their posts.

#### P5: Parlor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Gray chaise longues and sapphire-colored couches are arranged about this parlor, which is occupied by a handful of guests. A tall pine tree bedecked in tinsel and gilded baubles stands majestically in one corner.
^484

##### Guests

At any given time during the gala, `1d8` [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) lounge in this room. You can add a named guest to the parlor by rolling once on the Gala Guests table.

![Left to Right: Rust-Colore...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/095-12-005-magic-items.webp#center "Left to Right: Rust-Colored Bag of Tricks, Serpentine Owl, Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Quiver of Ehlonna")

#### P6: Art Gallery

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Vibrant paintings and tapestries depicting the seasons hang in this grand room. Along the walls are displays of statuettes, crystal vases, and other art objects.
^487

##### Secret Door

A secret door in the northeast corner of the room has a painting mounted to it. The painting depicts two tiefling children playing in the snow, and the painting's frame is made of gray wood carved with snowflakes. Pressing the snowflake in the bottom middle of the frame causes the secret door to swing outward on hidden hinges, revealing a staircase to the storage cellar (area P18). A character who examines the painting or searches the wall for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the sheen of frequent touches on the snowflake button.

##### Treasure

Four items on display are magical:

- [Rust-colored bag of tricks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-tricks-rust.md)  
- [Figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-serpentine-owl.md)  
- [Gauntlets of ogre power](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gauntlets-of-ogre-power.md)  
- [Quiver of Ehlonna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quiver-of-ehlonna.md)  

Some nonmagical treasures are displayed here as well, including three silk tapestries (250 gp each), eight paintings by famous artists (750 gp each), an onyx mountain goat statuette with garnets for eyes (250 gp), and a beautiful blue opal statuette depicting an archfey known as the Prince of Frost (5,000 gp).

#### P7: Banquet Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two long, mahogany tables are piled high with sugared plums, decadent gingerbreads, and glazed meats. Two sprites flutter near them, encouraging guests to sample the food.
^48b

The two [sprites](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite.md) are named Sysie and Val. Any character who converses with them and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notices they are both uneasy. They sense something is amiss with Zorhanna, but neither sprite dares speak out for fear of inviting the Adulares' wrath or a stern lecture from Oren, the satyr head of staff. A character can convince either sprite to share their concerns by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, but this check is made with disadvantage if Zorhanna is within the sprite's line of sight.

##### Guests

At any given time during the gala, `1d6 + 2` [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) enjoy food and refreshments here. You can add a named guest by rolling once on the Gala Guests table.

#### P8: Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The scent of herbs and the clatter of pots fill this busy kitchen. Amid the satyr and pixie cooks stands a much taller figure with pale, knotted, bark-like skin. Her glassy black eyes survey the kitchen's staff with piercing sternness.
^48e

Two [satyrs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) and three [pixies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) busy themselves with cooking tasks. The dour [dryad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) head chef, Anisetta, lords over the kitchen and barks out orders. Anisetta also carries a key for the storage closets in the cellar (area P18) but doesn't recall anything important being stored in them.

If Anisetta catches anyone who isn't staff in the kitchen, she sharply asks them to leave in Elvish. If that doesn't work, she tromps out of the kitchen to find Oren, the head of staff (see area P3), and demands he deal with the situation, which he tries to do diplomatically.

##### Staircase

A staircase leads to the storage cellar (area P18). This stairway is reserved for servants, but a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces Anisetta to let them access it.

#### P9: Balcony

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This balcony, which overlooks the ballroom, is enclosed by an alabaster balustrade that has gold-leaf reindeer for balusters.
^491

It's a 20-foot drop from the balcony to the ballroom floor.

Guests. At any given time during the gala, `1d6` [nobles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) mingle here. You can add a named guest to the ballroom by rolling once on the Gala Guests table.

#### P10: Main Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Paintings in gilded frames hang on the walls of this spacious, lavishly decorated bedchamber.
^493

##### Magic Painting

One of the paintings depicts a reindeer-shaped creature made of dark woven branches and emerald-green leaves. If a creature moves within 5 feet of the painting, the image animates, and the wooden reindeer-like creature cheerfully introduces itself as Oak, personal assistant to Zorhanna and Eliphas.

Oak explains that his job is to keep track of Lord and Lady Adulare's schedule and remind them of any mundane tasks they might have forgotten. Oak doesn't normally share information with strangers, but Zorhanna and Eliphas have ignored the painting of late, and Oak is dying to talk to someone. Any character who asks Oak a question about Zorhanna, Eliphas, or the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace can make a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the check is successful, Oak provides an answer other than, "Well, I can't really talk about that." Its answers are as follows:

- **Eliphas.** "Eliphas has been staying in the guest room on the opposite side of Paliset Hall. If you see him, please remind him he has an appointment with that emissary from Prismeer in two days."  
- **Zorhanna.** "Zorhanna doesn't sleep, but she used to check in with me after finishing her trance. Lately, she won't even say hello. I don't know what I said to offend her."  
- **Shard Solitaire Necklace.** "That old thing? Zorhanna took it from the pool a few weeks ago for a dress fitting and hasn't taken it off since. Oh, dear, did I say pool? You know what? Forget I said anything."  

The magic painting is a Small object with AC 11, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison or psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points or removing it from the room renders it nonmagical. If a character threatens to destroy Oak, the painting reveals that Zorhanna's vault is "hidden in the tower pool beyond the bathroom," then nods toward area P11.

#### P11: Main Bathroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A porcelain bathtub sits against one wall of this room, which also contains two tables stacked with clean towels, scented bars of soap, and bottles. At the back of the room, blocking a short staircase that climbs to a turret, is a ten-foot-tall marble statue of a reindeer.
^496

The statue is a [stone golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) that guards the way to area P12. Zorhanna, her simulacrum, or someone disguised as Zorhanna can command the golem to move aside. Otherwise, the golem attacks if it takes damage or if someone tries to sneak past it into area P12. In combat, the golem uses Slow on its first turn. On subsequent turns, it makes Slam attacks with its hooves and antlers. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the golem turns to dust, then re-forms and returns to its post `1d4` hours later. After it is destroyed three times, it doesn't re-form.

##### Treasure

Characters who search the room find a [potion of healing (superior)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md) and four bottles of scented bath oil (25 gp each) atop the table farthest from the bathtub.

#### P12: Vault Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A rectangular pool is situated in the middle of this octagonal turret, which has tiled walls and a tiled floor. The turret's vaulted ceiling bears a painted mural of a fantastically beautiful fey creature who looks like winter incarnate. The pool's water is perfectly clear, revealing a tile mosaic at the bottom of it. In the center of the pool's mosaic are three concentric, gilded rings. The pool has no visible drain.
^499

The painted mural on the ceiling depicts the Prince of Frost, an archfey of Zorhanna's acquaintance.

##### Pool

The pool is 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, 5 feet deep, and filled with frigid water. When a creature other than Zorhanna enters the water for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (`4d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

No more than once per day, while Zorhanna is immersed in the pool, she can use it to contact the Prince of Frost and ask him up to three questions. He can choose not to answer a question or provide a truthful answer, but he can't lie. He can then ask Zorhanna three questions, each of which must be answered truthfully or not at all.

##### Rune Tile

The Elvish rune for "winter" is inscribed on the wall opposite the stairs. A character who examines that wall and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots the rune, which can also be found with a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. Pressing the rune's tile opens hidden pipes at the bottom of the pool and drains it completely in 1 minute. The pool remains empty for 10 minutes, after which it automatically refills with frigid water.

##### Vault

The three concentric, gilded rings at the bottom of the pool are the locking mechanisms for a hidden safe. Each ring is flat and set in a shallow groove, such that it can be rotated. Once the water in the pool is drained, tiny Elvish runes representing the letters A through Z magically appear on the surface of each ring, with the letters spaced around the ring at equal intervals. Opening the safe requires that the three rings be turned in their grooves until their runes line up to form the word "OAK." Only Zorhanna and her simulacrum know the correct combination of letters (although "OAK" is a direct reference to the magic painting in area P10).

The safe has no mechanisms that a thief can exploit using thieves' tools, but a [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic can be used to open it.

When the rings are properly aligned or the safe is opened by other means, the circular area inside the innermost ring disappears, allowing access to a hidden compartment measuring 1 foot on each side. If the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace was taken from [Zorhanna's simulacrum](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhannas-simulacrum-kftgv.md), it rests in the compartment (the stone is still attuned to the Far Realm entity trapped inside it). Otherwise, the compartment is empty.

Seconds before the pool refills with water, the safe reseals itself and the runes vanish from the golden rings.

#### P13: Vanity

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Elegant dresses and blouses hang on racks along the walls of this narrow chamber. A white wooden dresser against the far wall has a circular mirror mounted above it.
^49e

The garments stored here are exquisite. The dresser's drawers contain enough materials (wigs, cosmetics, and whatnot) to assemble one [disguise kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/disguise-kit.md).

#### P14: Guest Bedroom

The door to this room is closed and unlocked.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This bedroom is spacious and nicely appointed. A man wearing a rich-blue coat sits on the edge of a narrow bed. His trimmed white beard darkens at its roots, and kindly wrinkles frame his brow and eyes.
> 
> "Looking to escape the crowds?" he asks with a thin smile. "I get that. You're welcome to hide in here with me for as long as you like."
^4a0

[Eliphas](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/eliphas-adulare-kftgv.md) is a neutral good, human [werebear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/werebear.md) who can adopt the form of a polar bear. He has an Intelligence score of 18 and the following additional action option:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Spellcasting (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** Eliphas casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (save DC 15):
> 
> At will: [light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/light.md), [minor illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md), [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md)
> 
> 2/day each: [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [fog cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md)
> 
> 1/day each: [phantasmal force](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-force.md), [shatter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shatter.md)
^4a1

If the characters reveal who they are and why they've come, a great weight seems to lift from Eliphas's shoulders as he thanks them for heeding his summons. "I knew Fifel wouldn't let me down!" he adds.

Eliphas knows the following pieces of information:

- **Zorhanna's Simulacrum.** "I'm now convinced that my wife has been replaced by a simulacrum—a lookalike invested with her knowledge and spellcasting ability. I dimly recall Zorhanna mentioning that the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) has the power to create such a thing."  
- **Secret Vault.** "Zorhanna usually keeps her [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace in a vault hidden beneath a pool of frigid water in Paliset Hall's bathroom turret, which is guarded by a stone golem. Only Zorhanna can safely bypass the golem, and only Zorhanna knows the three-letter combination to the vault." (Eliphas can lead characters safely to area P11 if they ask to see the bathroom turret, and he will help them defeat the golem that guards it.)  
- **Weird Anomalies.** "Something strange is happening. I've seen walls, windows, and doors transform before my eyes, then suddenly everything is normal again. This only started a few hours ago, and it scares me. I just don't know what to do!"  

If the characters tell Eliphas they've also seen weird anomalies, Eliphas begins to wonder if Zorhanna is causing the anomalies because she is trapped somewhere in Paliset Hall and trying to reach out to them. If a character suggests the anomalies are caused by the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) or something else trapped inside it, Eliphas urges the characters to search Paliset Hall until they discover the truth.

#### P15: Guest Bathroom

A porcelain tub rests against one wall of this bathroom. The mirror hanging above the vanity is cracked. If asked, Eliphas sheepishly explains that he cracked the mirror in a shaving accident.

#### P16: Private Study

An [arcane lock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell has been cast on the door to this room. Zorhanna, her simulacrum, and Eliphas treat the door as though it were unlocked.

As an action, a character can try to open the magically locked door using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 22 Dexterity check, or try to force it open, doing so with a successful DC 22 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also opens the door.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this room are lined with tall shelves stuffed with leather-bound tomes. An elegant wooden desk is situated under a stained-glass window. Atop the desk is a thick book with a furry white cover and a crystal ball in a gilded stand.
^4a5

The books on the shelves span many topics mostly related to nature, the planes, and the Feywild in particular.

##### Treasure

Any character who spends 1 hour examining the books on the shelves can, at the end of that hour, make a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If the check is successful, the character finds a rare book worth 250 gp to a collector. Only four such books can be found here.

The fur-covered book on the desk is Zorhanna's [spellbook](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spellbook.md), which contains the following spells: [arcane lock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md), [banishment](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/banishment.md), [cone of cold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold.md), [counterspell](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/counterspell.md), [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect thoughts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [fire shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fire-shield.md), [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md), [globe of invulnerability](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/globe-of-invulnerability.md), [ice storm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ice-storm.md), [identify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md), [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md), [legend lore](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/legend-lore.md), [lightning bolt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lightning-bolt.md), [mage armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-armor.md), [magic missile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-missile.md), [mind blank](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mind-blank.md), [mirror image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mirror-image.md), [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md), [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md), [polymorph](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph.md), [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md), [scrying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md), [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md), [stoneskin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stoneskin.md), [teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md), [time stop](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/time-stop.md), [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md), and [wall of force](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-force.md).

The crystal ball on the desk is nonmagical but worth 1,000 gp. It can be used as a focus for the [scrying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) spell.

Inside one of the desk drawers is a set of [tinker's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinkers-tools.md) and a partially dismantled (and nonfunctional) music box similar in design to the ones used by the Golden Vault. Inside another desk drawer is a set of [calligrapher's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/calligraphers-supplies.md), three blank invitations to the winter solstice gala, some envelopes, a wax seal, and a silk [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing 50 pp.

#### P17: Powder and Fitting Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room contains a wooden vanity with a circular mirror mounted to the wall above it. Other furnishings include a table, a padded chair, and a dresser.
^4a8

The dresser contains folded garments, straight pins, scissors, wigs, and a cloth tape measure. The table bears an impressive selection of cosmetics.

#### P18: Cellar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Wooden casks and crates line the walls of this cellar, which has an ascending staircase at each end. A pair of wooden doors flank a narrow passageway in the middle of one wall. Eerie, scintillating light streams around the edges of one of the doors.
^4aa

The crates contain foodstuffs, and the casks contain wine. The staircases lead to areas P6 and P8, respectively.

##### Storage Closets

Both storage closets are locked. Oren (see area P3) and Anisetta (see area P8) carry keys to these closets. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to open a locked door, doing so with a successful DC 11 Dexterity check, or try to force open the door, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A [knock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also opens the door.

The easternmost closet is the one emitting light. When a character opens this closet for the first time, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Floating in space is a pulsing rift of iridescent energy, like a jagged scar in the fabric of reality. The light dims for a second, revealing faint shadows shifting deep within the rift, before it flares once more.
^4ac

##### Rift

The rift is a one-way portal to the extraplanar space inside the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md). A creature that enters the rift's space immediately disappears, then reappears in area P20 in a random unoccupied space atop the rock marked A or B on map 12.2. The rift can't be dispelled, but it disappears when the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) ceases to be magical (see "The Solitaire Cracks" later in the adventure).

![Adventurers are trapped in...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/096-12-009-trapped-in-space.webp#center "Adventurers are trapped in the shard solitaire's extradimensional space with Zorhanna Adulare.")

#### P19: Servants' Quarters

This hallway has numerous doors leading to simple bedrooms for servants. All the bedroom doors can be locked from the inside, but all are currently unlocked. No servants are here during the gala.

#### P20: Inside the Solitaire Rift

Each character who enters the rift in area P18 is deposited in the [shard solitaire's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) extradimensional space, appearing atop the rock marked A or B on map 12.2. Divide the party as evenly as possible among these two locations. To set the scene, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You appear on a smooth, flat-topped rock floating in the middle of a magically charged maelstrom filled with thunderous roars. Other rocks float nearby. Standing on the largest one is Zorhanna in her regalia. You also sense a terrible presence—something formless and indescribable—lurking all around you.
> 
> Zorhanna points at you and laughs. "The shapeless evil finally appears! Whatever you are, you can't fool me! Prepare to face the wrath of [Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md)!"
^4b0

[Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md) stands in the middle of the largest floating rock (marked C on map 12.2). She is a chaotic good, elf [archmage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) who speaks Auran, Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. She has expended all her 6th-level and higher spell slots trying to escape from the [shard solitaire's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) extradimensional space, to no avail.

Zorhanna's sense of reality has been warped by prolonged contact with the shapeless Far Realm entity that haunts the extradimensional space. She is convinced that the characters were conjured by this entity to harm her, so she attacks them. She casts [cone of cold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold.md) or [lightning bolt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lightning-bolt.md) every round on her turn for as long as she is able to do so. If one or more characters close to melee distance, she casts [shocking grasp](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shocking-grasp.md) and [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md) on her next turn, using the latter spell to teleport to another rock.

As an action, a character can make a DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check while trying to convince Zorhanna that the party is not her enemy. If the check is successful, Zorhanna does nothing on her next turn except mutter to herself as she ponders what the character said. If the check fails, Zorhanna continues her attack. Once three such checks succeed, Zorhanna concludes that the characters are not her enemies and calls for an end to hostilities. She then screams into the void, "You almost had me! Nice try, whatever you are!"

The characters can also convince Zorhanna to stop attacking them by returning her spellbook to her. The spellbook (found in area P16) excites her because it contains the [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell—her ticket to freedom (see "Escaping the Rift" below).

Once Zorhanna is no longer hostile toward the characters, they can question her and learn the following information:

- **About the Shard Solitaire.** "Years ago, I stole the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) from three hags who were trying to harness its extradimensional energy, which, as you can see, is highly unstable. I thought I could keep the diamond safe, but I couldn't resist showing it off from time to time. I let my vanity get the better of me."  
- **The Entity.** "Something alien and evil wormed its way into the [shard solitaire's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) extradimensional rift and became trapped here, just as we are. This entity has a mind, but no body or soul. I believe it comes from a dimension called the Far Realm. It is pure evil and can't be allowed to escape."  

##### Extradimensional Rift

The rocks that float in the extradimensional rift are flat on top and suspended in the air at roughly the same elevation. A creature can leap from one rock to its closest neighbor without having to make an ability check.

Any creature that falls off a rock plunges into the rift. At the start of that creature's next turn, energy from the rift strikes the creature for 22 (`4d10`) force damage, then teleports the creature, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, to a random unoccupied space atop one of the larger rocks. Roll a `d6` to determine which rock: 1–2, rock A; 3–4, rock B; or 5–6, rock C.

##### Far Realm Entity

The Far Realm entity can't be seen, heard, targeted, attacked, or harmed. Its presence can merely be felt. At the end of each hour spent in the extradimensional space with this entity, a creature must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) psychic damage.

If the characters crave more combat or if you think they've had too easy a time so far, the entity manifests three [invisible stalkers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) that are hostile toward the characters. When a stalker drops to 0 hit points, it lets out a terrible howl as it disperses. Creating these stalkers takes energy the entity needs to free itself from the extradimensional rift, so it won't create more than three of them.

##### Escaping the Rift

A creature can't simply teleport from the [shard solitaire's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) extradimensional space. A [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell or similar magic is required.

If Zorhanna obtains her spellbook, she can use it to prepare the [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell, but only after finishing a 4-hour trance (the equivalent of a long rest for her). If the characters escape with Zorhanna before the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) cracks, she admits that the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) is too dangerous to keep in Paliset Hall and does everything in her power to make sure the characters leave with it. She also suggests the characters place it inside a [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) or some other item that contains extradimensional storage space, in case the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) explodes.

If Zorhanna and the characters have no means of escaping the extradimensional space on their own, they are released when the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) cracks (see "The Solitaire Cracks" below). Until then, they must try to resist the psychic damage caused by the Far Realm entity.

## The Crestfall Coven

The hags of the Crestfall Coven have waited many years to steal back the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md). Until now, ill omens and vague auguries have stayed their hand, but the moment has finally come.

With the help of a tiefling [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) named Mettle (see the Gala Guests table earlier in the adventure), the hags have been able to spy on the gala. Disguised as three elf nobles from the Feywild, the three [night hags](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) (whose names are Myrrel Malum, Esadora Crane, and Netheria Nightblossom) arrive at Paliset Hall in one of the Adulares's unicorn-drawn coaches. After exiting the coach, the hags present stolen invitations to the winter wolves standing guard outside, then waltz into Paliset Hall, cackling with delight at how well their plan is unfolding.

### Hunt for the Shard Solitaire

If all three members of the Crestfall Coven are within 30 feet of each other, they gain the benefit of the Shared Spellcasting trait described in the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the "Monster Manual". One of the three hags uses this trait to cast [locate object](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-object.md) to find the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md). If they find the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) in another creature's possession, the hags attack whoever has it. If the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) necklace teleported to Zorhanna's vault, the hags use Change Shape to assume Zorhanna's appearance and slip past the vault's stone golem guardian. One of the hags then casts [contact other plane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contact-other-plane.md) (which has a 1-minute casting time) to learn the three-letter combination needed to open the vault.

If the characters are trapped inside the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) or otherwise unable to thwart the Crestfall Coven, the hags snatch the necklace from the vault and use their [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spells to transport to Loch Wynnis, where they wait for Mettle.

### Confronting the Hags

Characters in Paliset Hall might encounter the Crestfall Coven as the hags search for the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) necklace. The hags are willing to cut a deal with the characters, provided the coven gets to keep the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md). Clever characters might help the hags break into Zorhanna's vault, then betray the hags and claim the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) for themselves. Similarly, any character who took Mettle's [hag eye](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hag-eye.md) can trade it for the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), since the hags don't want to suffer the consequences of their [hag eye](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hag-eye.md) being destroyed.

If a night hag is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, it uses [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) to flee. If two members of the coven are forced to flee in this manner, the third flees as well.

## The Solitaire Cracks

At some point before the end of the adventure, the Far Realm entity finally breaks free of the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), causing it to crack like a walnut. Here are some suggestions for when this event might occur:

- `1d8` hours after the characters return to the Material Plane with the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) in their possession  
- If the characters are trapped in area P20 with the Far Realm entity and have no means of escape  
- After the night hags obtain the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) but before they can use their [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spells to escape with it  

The cracking of the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) is audible to anyone holding or wearing it. In that instant, the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) becomes a flawed, nonmagical diamond worth 500 gp, and all the creatures and extradimensional energy contained within it are released at once. If Zorhanna is alive, she materializes in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone, as do any characters who were trapped in the stone with her. The Far Realm entity is nowhere to be seen, and its presence can no longer be felt.

The extradimensional energy released from the stone has the same effect as a [staff of power's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff-of-power.md) Retributive Strike property, centered on the stone itself. The explosion occurs a split second before creatures trapped inside the stone are released, sparing them from the effect.

If the characters placed the uncracked stone in the extradimensional space of a magic item such as a [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) or Fifel's [haversack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hewards-handy-haversack.md), the explosion is confined to that item's extradimensional space, doing no harm to the container; a split second later, creatures released from the stone appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of that container, rather than inside its extradimensional space near the stone itself.

## Conclusion

After the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) cracks, assuming they survive, the characters can take stock of their triumphs or failures.

### Midwinter Miracles

If Zorhanna and Eliphas are reunited and the characters did their utmost to protect Paliset Hall and its guests, Eliphas sees that the characters receive their promised reward. If they already helped themselves to the magic items on display in the art gallery (area P6), Eliphas considers their reward paid in full.

If one or more characters died but Zorhanna survived, she makes arrangements with the Summer Queen, a powerful archfey, to have the characters brought back to life at no charge to the party, provided the characters didn't commit any despicable acts she's aware of. If Zorhanna perished but Eliphas survived, he calls in a few favors to raise characters from the dead.

### Back in Loch Wynnis

When the characters return to Loch Wynnis, Fifel greets them and asks about their visit to the Feywild. If they need to borrow his [Heward's handy haversack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hewards-handy-haversack.md) to safely contain and transport the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), he empties it and hands it to them.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, the organization rewards them only if Eliphas and Zorhanna both survived, no innocent lives were lost in Paliset Hall, and the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) didn't end up in the clutches of the Crestfall Coven. A Golden Vault operative offers the characters a rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as a reward, which is delivered the next day.

### It Came from the Far Realm

What happens to the Far Realm entity is for you to decide. As a thing of pure thought, it might corrupt creatures in its vicinity, transforming them into horrible Aberrations or zealous Far Realm cultists. Conversely, it might find solace in the body of some creature powerful enough to serve as its new host.

## Secrets of the Shard Solitaire

Long ago, someone dropped a [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) full of jewels into a [portable hole](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/portable-hole.md), creating an explosive portal to the Astral Plane. A 5,000 gp diamond contained within the bag absorbed some of the portal's volatile energy and became the [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) featured in this adventure.

The same Far Realm entity that wormed its way into the [shard solitaire's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md) extradimensional rift has also attuned to the stone. The entity can't do anything with the stone other than what it has already done to [Zorhanna Adulare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zorhanna-adulare-kftgv.md) (as described in this adventure). When the entity escapes the rift, the stone cracks and becomes nonmagical.

Although the characters never get the chance to wield the power of Zorhanna's [shard solitaire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-diamond-kftgv.md), other [such items](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shard-solitaire-kftgv.md) are scattered throughout the multiverse, waiting to be found.

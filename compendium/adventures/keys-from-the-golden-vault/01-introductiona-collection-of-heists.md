# Introduction–A Collection of Heists
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault, p. 5* 

*Keys from the Golden Vault* presents thirteen Dungeons & Dragons adventures that feature heists. In each adventure, the characters receive a mission, plan the job, execute their plan, and try to escape the scene. You can run each heist as a standalone adventure or as part of a larger campaign (see "A Campaign of Heists" later in this introduction). Each adventure can be adapted to take place in any campaign setting you wish.

## Using the Adventures

The Heist Adventures table summarizes the adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level and adheres to the following narrative structure:

- **Mission Briefing.** The characters are recruited to undertake a specific job. In most cases, this involves procuring an object.  
- **Plan the Heist.** The characters investigate the heist location, learn about the obstacles they need to overcome, and strategize about completing the job. Each adventure includes a way for the characters to create or obtain a map of the target location.  
- **Execute the Heist.** The characters enact their plans. Unforeseen complications often arise during this stage.  
- **Conclude the Heist.** The characters' success determines their reward and how the story might progress beyond the main adventure.  

These short adventures work best with players who enjoy the heist genre. In addition to thrills, drama, strategizing, and twists, each adventure includes opportunities for exploration, roleplaying, and combat.

## Running the Adventures

To run these adventures, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks ("Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual").

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
^003

When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." If the stat block appears elsewhere, the text tells you so; otherwise, you can find the stat block in the "Monster Manual".

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the "Player's Handbook". Magic items are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description elsewhere.

### Creating a Heist Crew

This book's adventures require the characters to practice teamwork. Encourage your players to think of their characters as longtime associates or perhaps relatives so they feel tight-knit from the start.

Similarly, ask your players to consider creating characters suited to undertaking heists. Combat prowess is less important when sneaking through a guarded complex, for example, whereas stealth, skill with locks, social skills, clever problem-solving, and versatile character abilities will shine.

Well-outfitted characters are also more likely to succeed at these adventures. Equipment such as thieves' tools, rope, and a grappling hook might mean the difference between taking a shortcut to the objective and getting caught.

Characters can accomplish these adventures' missions in multiple ways. As the Dungeon Master, reward creative thinking!

### A Campaign of Heists

You can combine the adventures in this book to form a campaign. Each adventure would be an episode in the campaign, with you filling in the details of the characters' stories between jobs.

If you go this route, encourage the players to create a crack team and a base of operations, a supporting cast of allies, and other hallmarks of a heist crew. Have your group decide on these details before play begins so the adventures progress seamlessly.

To ensure the characters are always prepared for their next heist, make sure their level matches the heist's level, as shown in the Heist Adventures table. For example, the characters should be 2nd level before undertaking "The Stygian Gambit."

**Heist Adventures**

## The Golden Vault

A heist crew might have a patron organization that hires the characters to undertake these adventures. If you wish to use such an organization, consider the Golden Vault.

Rumored to be associated with metallic dragons, the Golden Vault is a secretive organization that has its base on one of the good-aligned Outer Planes. Its membership and activities are almost impossible for outsiders to track, but those in the know are aware that the organization rights moral wrongs, supports virtuous underdogs, and handles delicate situations local authorities won't touch. The Golden Vault's motto reflects its primary motivation: "Do good, no matter the cost." Missions from the Golden Vault are often illegal, but they always support a just, moral cause.

The Golden Vault's undercover operatives monitor adventuring groups from major cities on the Material Plane. An operative might be a priest, a scholar, a charity worker, a government liaison, a philanthropist, or any other upstanding local.

Once an adventuring group proves itself effective and virtuous, an operative approaches the characters to offer Golden Vault membership. Should the group accept, its members join the ranks of the Golden Vault, and the person who invited them becomes their handler for future missions. For an example of a handler, see the "Meera Raheer" section.

If the characters get stuck, the Golden Vault can provide unexpected help. For instance, if the characters lack vital information needed for a heist, their handler might share a recent discovery. If the characters need special equipment, their handler might be able to obtain it for them, provided the equipment is readily available and not too expensive.

If you decide to use the Golden Vault as the characters' patron organization, work with the players to determine what heroic or impressive deeds their characters performed in their backstories to gain the attention of the Golden Vault. Then improvise a roleplaying scene in which the characters meet their Golden Vault handler.

### Keys from the Golden Vault

If the characters become Golden Vault operatives, they receive an ornate, key-operated music box from their handler. Each adventure in this book includes a "Using the Golden Vault" section, in which the Golden Vault dispatches a golden key to the group, usually via a hired courier. When the golden key is inserted into the characters' music box and turned, the box pops open and plays a message that assigns them a heist, provides basic details, and sets them on the right path. After the message plays, the box closes and the key vanishes.

### Heroes in the Shadows

Secrecy is paramount for the Golden Vault. To protect the organization, the characters' handler never provides more information than is absolutely necessary. Similarly, Golden Vault operatives are aware of only a handful of their fellow members. This compartmentalization ensures no one individual knows enough to jeopardize the organization at large.

Should operatives be caught breaking the law while serving the Golden Vault, the organization does its best to protect them. It may pull strings to ensure members aren't incarcerated—or worse—depending on the organization's resources in the area.

### Meera Raheer

![Meera Raheer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/001-00-002-meera-raheer.webp#center)

[Meera Raheer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/meera-raheer-kftgv.md) (lawful good, human [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) is a Golden Vault handler you can assign to oversee your players' heist crew.

When Meera was young, her kindhearted and upstanding mothers served as city clerks. But when they began investigating financial irregularities, the unscrupulous mayor framed them for embezzlement to cover his own corruption. The only evidence of the Raheers' innocence was a packet of letters between the mayor and his conspirators. The letters were locked in the mayor's office.

Luckily for the Raheers, a crew of Golden Vault operatives infiltrated city hall, retrieved the letters, and revealed the mayor's crimes. The Raheers kept fighting against government corruption, and Meera has followed in her parents' footsteps, continuing their anti-corruption work by becoming a city's clerk and a member of the Golden Vault.

Meera lives and breathes city protocols, procedures, and statutes. She also understands that sometimes doing the right thing means operating outside the law.

## Heist Complications

Unforeseen complications are an iconic aspect of heist narratives. Whether they take the form of a rival crew appearing out of nowhere or a treasure that turns out to be fake, complications ratchet up the tension and require the characters to think on their feet.

If you want to challenge your players, consider adding one of the complications below to any of this book's adventures.

### The Moving MacGuffin

Many of this book's heists involve procuring a MacGuffin. Part of preparing for these heists is determining where the MacGuffin in question is located.

If the characters are having too easy of a time finding the MacGuffin, consider shifting its location to another place that makes sense. Or consider revealing that the MacGuffin is a fake, and the real prize is still nearby. The characters should still be able to determine where it's really located.

For example, in "The Murkmire Malevolence," perhaps the MacGuffin is no longer in the Gemstone Wing and is being stored in the museum's attic overnight. The characters could learn this detail by reading notes they discover in the curator's office or by questioning one of the museum guards.

If you use the moving MacGuffin complication, be careful of moving the MacGuffin more than once. Having trouble locating the object of the heist could unduly frustrate your players.

### Rival Crew

A rival crew vying for the same goal can increase the pressure on the characters. Regardless of your players' goal, once another crew appears, the adventure becomes a race to accomplish the objective first.

You can add a rival crew to an adventure at any time. When you do, make it clear to the characters that they have competition. The characters might see evidence of their rivals, such as an alarm that has already been disabled or an [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) guard. At some point, the characters might even catch their rivals trying to steal the adventure's MacGuffin from right under their noses!

The rival crew could include some or all of the following members:

**Arlo Kettletoe** (neutral halfling) is abrupt and direct with their compatriots. Arlo loves puns and wordplay.

**Enna "The Silence" Galakiir** (neutral elf) is an intimidating, stealthy woman who rarely speaks; when she does, her voice is a quiet hiss.

**Gregir Fendelsohn** (lawful neutral human) is loyal and passionate. He insists on the crew getting paid no matter what.

**Sabrina "Kill More" Kilgore** (chaotic neutral human) is a brash, violent woman who loves thrills and sweets.

**Torgja Stonecrusher** (chaotic neutral dwarf) has a jovial, happy-go-lucky nature that belies her ruthlessness.

**Tosh Starling** (neutral orc) is loquacious but always focused on his objective. He takes pride in his meticulously groomed appearance.

If a fight breaks out between the characters and a rival crew, use stat blocks for the rivals that are appropriate for the adventure's level, as indicated in the Rival Crew Statistics table. The stat blocks can be found in the "Monster Manual".

**Rival Crew Statistics**

| Rival | Levels 1–4 Stat Blocks | Levels 5–8 Stat Blocks | Levels 9–11 Stat Blocks |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Arlo | [Bandit captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) | [Knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) | [Mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) |

| Gregir | [Bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) | [Thug](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) | [Veteran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) |

![Careful planning is key to...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/002-00-003-careful-planning.webp#center "Careful planning is key to pulling off a dangerous heist")

#### Rival Crew in Play

Decide whether the rival crew is ahead of or behind the characters in pursuit of the objective. If either would make sense for your game, roll a `d20`. On an even result, the rivals are closer to achieving the objective than the characters. On an odd result, the rivals are nipping at the characters' heels.

![Golden Vault Seal](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/003-00-004-golden-vault-seal.webp#center)

Pay attention to how the characters respond to their rivals' presence. If the characters take pains to thwart trailing rivals or catch leading rivals, the characters should achieve their objective without further complication. If the characters ignore the rival crew, the rivals should achieve the objective first. Then it's up to the characters to chase their rivals and try to salvage the mission.

Always give the characters the opportunity to confront rivals who have achieved the objective first. This might lead to a negotiation scene or a fight.

#### Rival Crew Motivations

A rival crew might pursue the characters' objective for a variety of reasons. Greed might motivate rivals to steal a valuable objective, or they might have deep emotional involvement in the story.

A rival crew might be working at the behest of a patron. Perhaps an evil guild leader has hired the rivals to steal the MacGuffin. If the characters aren't working for the Golden Vault, perhaps the rivals are—and they might try to recruit the characters to their cause.

The Rival Crew Motivations table provides hooks for how a rival crew might become involved in each of this book's adventures.

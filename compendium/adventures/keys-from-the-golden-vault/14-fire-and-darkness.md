# Fire and Darkness
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault, p. 195* 

*An Adventure for 11th-Level Characters*

For centuries, a powerful efreeti named Vrakir sent his armies against numerous foes and burned countless cities to ash. Now, the tyrant has found an artifact of unimaginable evil: the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md).

In this heist, the heroes must infiltrate Brimstone Hold, the prison-fortress where Vrakir has locked away the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md), and escape with the efreeti's prize. The characters' contact is an arcanaloth named Nebukath, the hold's duplicitous administrator, who secretly covets the book and plans to betray the heroes as soon as the group recovers it.

## Adventure Background

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/099-13-002-ch13-key.webp#center)

Vrakir obtained the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md) by accident. The efreeti knew the red dragon Drendarylix laired only a few days' ride from Brimstone Hold, one of Vrakir's fortresses. Many adventurers over the years tried to slay the foul creature, which had attacked and looted nearby villages for decades. One day, word reached Vrakir that Drendarylix had been slain but that the dragon's vanquishers had also perished in the battle. Thinking the lair would be easy to plunder, Vrakir set off with a contingent of warriors to claim its riches.

When he arrived, however, Vrakir learned the truth: the adventurers who had supposedly slain Drendarylix were cultists who had arrived to worship the wicked beast. Worse, the cult was conducting a ritual to turn Drendarylix into a dracolich.

Displeased with the idea of a dracolich on his doorstep, Vrakir slew the cultists before they could finish the ritual, destroying Drendarylix in the process. Only once the dust settled did the efreeti learn what had given the cultists their power: the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md). Without hesitation, Vrakir claimed the artifact, taking it to Brimstone Hold to plot how best to use it to fuel his evil.

## Hooks and Rewards

If you're not using the Golden Vault as the characters' patron (see the "Using the Golden Vault" section), you can use one of the following hooks to get the characters involved in the adventure.

### Close to Home

Vrakir has set his mind to conquering the characters' homeland. The region's brave defenders have rebuffed his army's initial assaults, but they stand little chance of holding out once Vrakir unleashes the fell power of the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md).

Syr Isbeth, the human leader of the defense effort, received a missive from the arcanaloth Nebukath professing the arcanaloth's sympathies for her cause and providing information about the book's location. Syr Isbeth doesn't know whether Nebukath can be trusted, but stealing the book would stymie Vrakir's war effort—it's too good an opportunity to pass up. She asks the characters to undertake this perilous mission, promising them the title to a regional stronghold, along with its retinue of five [knights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and one hundred [guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), if they bring her the book or proof of its destruction.

### A Short Leash

The Fated (a faction based in Sigil) has interests throughout the multiverse, and many of them have been disrupted by Vrakir's conquests. The Fated has decided it is time to curtail Vrakir's power, so it contacted the opportunistic arcanaloth Nebukath for information about how to deprive the efreeti of his greatest weapon.

Farn Bindelbrot, a gnome operative for the Fated, identified the characters as having the skills needed for such a difficult task. Should the characters deliver the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md) to Farn, he will reward them with an [amulet of the planes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/amulet-of-the-planes.md). Farn promises the Fated will then safely secure the book.

### Redemption

A halfling warlock named Remi Duskweather renounced her pact and dedicated herself to serving a holy order (potentially one connected with a cleric or paladin in the party). As her final test of faith, Remi has been tasked with using her connection to her former patron—the arcanaloth Nebukath—to help the holy order obtain and destroy the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md).

Remi has gotten the necessary information from Nebukath, but stealing the book is beyond her ability, so she recruits the characters to carry out this task for the order. Remi offers no reward, but if the characters bring the book or proof of its destruction to the order, each character receives a "blessing" of their choice, either from the gods they worship or from a god worshiped by Remi's holy order: a [blessing of health](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/blessing-of-health.md), a [blessing of protection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/blessing-of-protection.md), or a [blessing of understanding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/blessing-of-understanding.md), all of which are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit, along with a hand-drawn map of Brimstone Fortress (see map 13.1).

When the characters use the golden key to open their music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Greetings, operatives. The Golden Vault has learned that an efreeti named Vrakir has the Book of Vile Darkness. We need you to steal this evil artifact so we can destroy it. This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to infiltrate the fortress of Brimstone Hold, where the book is kept.
> 
> "We obtained a map of the fortress from an informant of ours, an arcanaloth named Nebukath, who works in Brimstone Hold. Nebukath is willing to provide further assistance, but we suspect the arcanaloth has reasons of their own to acquire the book, so be on your guard!
> 
> "Nebukath is unsure how long Vrakir plans to keep the book in the fortress, meaning time is of the essence. Good luck, operatives."
^4c9

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

## Planning the Heist

Once the characters are ready to begin planning the heist, show the players map 13.1. The map arrives via whoever asks the characters to undertake this mission. Written on the backside of the map is the following note in Common:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This is as detailed a map as I could find. The book's location is marked with an X. Please hurry, as Vrakir could move it at any time. I fear the chaos and destruction he will unleash once he has fully embraced the book's power.—N.
^4cb

The following sections contain information that can help guide the characters as they form their plan. You can provide this information straightforwardly to the players, present it through conversations with the party's patron, or allow characters to use their skills and abilities to research and gather information.

![Map 13.1: Players' Map](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/100-13-003-player-map.webp#center)

### Brimstone Hold's Inhabitants

Here's a summary of Brimstone Hold's inhabitants:

- **Efreet.** Vrakir spends most of his time on the Elemental Plane of Fire, visiting Brimstone Hold only occasionally. In his absence, the hold is under the command of an efreeti named [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md).  
- **Nebukath the Arcanaloth.** The characters' map was provided by an arcanaloth named Nebukath, who serves as Brimstone Hold's administrator and is working to undermine Vrakir. If the characters seek out Nebukath in the hold, the arcanaloth may help them.  
- **Various Defenders.** The hold is defended by [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) devils (whose [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#truesight) allows them to see through most forms of magical concealment), duergar, and [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md), as well as a [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) named Kalimrax and a [beholder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) known as the Eye of the Efreet.  

### Approaching Brimstone Hold

Possible ways to approach the fortress include the following:

- **Across Volcanic Terrain.** The hold is built inside a rock wall at the foot of a volcano. Lava pours down the volcano's slopes on either side of the hold and forms a molten river that flows around the hold.  
- **Main Entrance.** A stone bridge spans the lava river and leads to the hold's main entrance. The bridge is mostly used by Vrakir's troops, who often return with prisoners in tow, and sometimes visitors who have business with [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) approach this way.  
- **The Harbor.** A mile further down the lava river, a chaotic neutral cambion named Klax runs a trading depot that ships supplies to Brimstone Hold. Klax's fire-resistant boats dock at the hold's lava harbor once every ten days. The crews lay over in guest quarters at the hold before departing the following day. (If the characters embark on their mission while Klax's traders are at the hold, the cambion can be found in area B6.)  

### Additional Considerations

Here are some other things for characters to consider as they plan their heist:

- **Fire Protection.** Many creatures and hazards in the hold deal fire damage.  
- **Timing Arrival.** The characters can time their arrival to coincide with the arrival of a prisoner escort or supply shipment. Timing their arrival to Vrakir's presence or absence is harder, since the efreeti travels to the fortress via the [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell. Doing so might first require characters to spy on the hold's activities.  
- **Avoiding Confrontation.** Vrakir is a powerful adversary. The characters are best off avoiding a confrontation with him, at least until the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md) is out of his grasp.  

## Brimstone Hold

Brimstone Hold is one of Vrakir's remote military outposts on the Material Plane. The adventure assumes the hold is built alongside an active volcano in the middle of a vast lava plain, but you can place the hold in any suitably fiery region in your game's setting.

Brimstone Hold is bordered on three sides by a river of lava. The hold is enclosed on its eastern edge by a rocky volcanic slope, and the hold's interior areas have been carved into the volcano. The main entrance into the interior has been carved to resemble a giant efreeti face, whose open mouth spews lava into the harbor below.

### General Features

The following features are common throughout Brimstone Hold.

#### Ceilings

Interior areas have 15-foot-high ceilings, except in areas B22 and B25–B29, where the ceilings are 30 feet high.

#### Doors

All exterior doors are made of solid iron and are barred on the inside. As an action, a character can try to break down a barred door, doing so with a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

Interior doors are made of iron and are unlocked unless the text states otherwise.

##### Secret Doors

Each secret door in the fortress is opened by stepping on a tiny pressure plate hidden in the floor nearby. As an action, a character can search the wall for secret doors and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. If the check is successful, the character finds the secret door and the pressure plate used to open it.

#### Extreme Heat

Creatures that spend 1 hour or more anywhere in the hold, or sail on the river of lava, are subject to the effects of "extreme heat" as described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

#### Illumination

Lava bathes the outer areas of the hold in dim light even on starless nights, while most of the hold's interior areas are dimly lit by braziers of glowing coals. Exceptions are noted in the text.

#### Lava

The lava around the hold and in the harbor is 10 feet deep, while the stream of lava pouring from area B22 is 2 feet deep. Any creature that enters lava for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (`10d10`) fire damage.

#### Outer Walls

The hold's 20-foot-thick curtain walls are faced with blocks of carved basalt and filled with a rubble core. The walls on the hold's lower level (bordering areas B4 and B5) stand 40 feet high, while those on the hold's upper level (bordering area B6) stand 20 feet high. Crenellations rise another 3 to 8 feet. Scaling a wall without magic or climbing gear requires a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### Towers

Tower walls are 15 feet thick, made of carved basalt, and studded with arrow slits. The towers on the hold's lower level (areas B2a, B2b, and B3) stand 60 feet high, while those on the hold's upper level (areas B8 and B9) are 80 feet high. Towers have interior floors every 20 feet, with stone stairs along the inside walls leading between floors. Tower doors shown on the map allow access from ground level. All towers also have doors that open onto the walkways of adjoining curtain walls, as well as trapdoors that open onto the towers' roofs.

### Denizens

The erinyes, duergar, and salamanders that defend the hold are united by their loyalty to Vrakir, but each group otherwise disdains the others. The defenders are slow to assist or seek assistance from members outside their own group.

Any fights or suspicious activities in the hold are reported to the [efreeti](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md), who places the defenders on high alert. Even if Vrakir is at the hold, the defenders bring their reports to [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) first, allowing him to deal with any trouble himself rather than risk Vrakir's ire. While on high alert, the hold's inhabitants can't be surprised, and [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) responds personally to any further reports of trouble, arriving after 1 minute with two [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) from area B20. After 24 hours with no incidents, the hold goes off high alert.

### Visitors

Klax's traders and Vrakir himself are visitors rather than full-time occupants. You can determine whether Vrakir and the traders are present by rolling a `d10` and a `d20`. A result of 1 or 2 on the `d10` indicates that Vrakir is present. A result of 1 or 2 on the `d20` indicates that Klax and her crew are present.

Alternatively, you can decide that Vrakir is either present or absent depending on how challenging you want the heist to be. The efreeti keeps his own schedule, and not even his most trusted servants know when or where he will appear next.

### Brimstone Hold Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 13.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 13.2: DM's Map](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/101-map-13-02-dms-map.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/102-map-13-02-dms-map-player.webp#gallery)

#### B1: Bridge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A broad stone bridge spans the fiery river, its arches luridly lit from below. Three-foot-high barriers line the causeway's edges, funneling travelers toward the gatehouse of Vrakir's imposing fortress.
^4dd

The bridge crosses the lava river at its narrowest point, spanning 300 feet and rising 30 feet above the river's surface. Constructed of heavy basalt blocks, the bridge's piers are plated with iron.

#### B2: Gatehouse

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two mighty towers of black stone flank the fortress's iron gate, while a third tower looms behind it. Fiery orange banners hang from the towers' parapets, rippling in the plumes of heat that rise off the river of lava.
^4df

The banners are 20 feet long and emblazoned with Vrakir's symbol—a crown encircling the branches of a tree wreathed in flame—as well his motto, atka ignari (Ignan for "all shall burn").

Two [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) are stationed on the rooftops of the towers closest to the bridge. If the characters approach the gatehouse and give a sound reason for being here, the erinyes open the way (see "Doors" and "Portcullises" below), escort the characters to area B10, and announce their presence to the salamanders in area B22 before returning to their posts.

When the hold is on high alert, a third [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) from area B15 takes up position in the gatehouse's rear tower.

##### Doors

The entrances from areas B1 and B4 are each protected by an iron double door that stands 20 feet high. The doors are held shut with interlocking iron bars that can be levered up or down as an action from the first floors of the adjoining towers.

Lifting the bars from within the central yard of area B2 requires a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, while bursting the gates from area B1 or B4 requires a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Any Medium or smaller creature attempting to force open one of these doors has disadvantage on its ability check to do so.

##### Portcullises

The gatehouse's portcullises are so large that they each require two winches to operate, one on the second floor of each adjoining tower, and the two winches must be operated simultaneously. For each winch, it takes 3 actions to raise a portcullis or 1 action to lower it.

As an action, a creature can try to lift a portcullis above its head, doing so with a successful a DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Any Medium or smaller creature attempting to do so has disadvantage on this check.

#### B3: Prison Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A forbidding tower overlooks the yard below, its toothed parapets etched black against the sky's ruddy glow.
^4e3

The [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) stationed here carries a [rope of entanglement](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rope-of-entanglement.md), which it uses to ensnare any prisoner who tries to escape.

##### Gruk-Gruk

Tossed carelessly on the floor of the tower's lowest story is Gruk-Gruk, a rag doll the size of a halfling. It has a goblin's skull for a head. The doll belongs to Yug, the ogre in area B14. The erinyes stole the doll as an act of cruelty.

![Gruk-Gruk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/103-13-004-gruk-gruk.webp#center)

#### B4: Prison Yard

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Huge blocks of rough basalt lie scattered about the center of this spacious yard, where ten armored duergar oversee a large number of haggard prisoners. The prisoners are using chisels and mallets to turn the basalt blocks into smaller worked-stone blocks, which are then stacked in piles around the yard's perimeter. The yard's eastern wall is a natural stone cliff, with two entrances carved into the cliff face and secured with heavy iron portcullises.
^4e6

Eighty prisoners ([commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) labor here under the watchful eyes of ten [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md).

The duergar pay little mind to anyone they believe to be on legitimate business in the hold. However, they don't allow anyone to communicate with the prisoners unless ordered to by one of the efreet. The duergar issue a stern warning the first time anyone makes unapproved contact with a prisoner, and they turn hostile after a second instance, attempting to subdue and capture the offender.

Most of the prisoners are too fearful to speak with visitors, but one prisoner named Venture (chaotic good, tiefling [gladiator](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) tries to get the characters' attention, seeing the party's arrival as a golden opportunity to escape. If the characters smuggle her some weapons, rope, and a grappling hook, Venture agrees to start a prison riot (see "Prison Riot" below).

##### Portcullises

The passages into the hold's interior are blocked by portcullises. The winch to operate the northern portcullis is accessible from the yard. The winch to operate the southern portcullis is inside the passage leading to area B11. It takes 3 actions to raise a portcullis or 1 action to lower it using the winch. As an action, a creature can try to lift a portcullis above its head, doing so with a successful a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

##### Prison Riot

If either Venture or the characters start a prison riot, all the duergar from areas B11 and B18 rush to area B4 to quell it. The erinyes in areas B2, B3, and B8 watch in amusement but don't intervene. If the characters aren't present, it takes the duergar 10 minutes to subdue the rioting prisoners.

If the characters return to the prison yard after obtaining the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md), the prisoners start another riot and overcome their captors.

#### B5: Inner Yard

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This empty yard is hemmed in by a rocky cliff on its eastern edge. A flight of stairs has been carved into the cliff face leading to the top, while a doorway at the base of the steps is set into the stone.
^4ea

Behind the door at the base of the stairs is a long tunnel that leads to areas B11 and B15–B19.

#### B6: Upper Yard

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The large, horseshoe-shaped upper yard wraps around the harbor in its center. Sturdy wooden cranes to the west overlook the quay below, while the eastern side houses small outbuildings. Towering over the eastern edge of the yard is the volcano's ash-covered slope, featuring a giant efreeti face carved from the stone and spewing lava from its mouth.
^4ec

The upper yard is patrolled by a [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) named Kalimrax. The dragon guards the fortress against aerial assault, but attacks from the air are few and far between. Kalimrax spends most of her time prowling about the harbor, idly threatening to devour any dockhands working there.

Kalimrax finds her task incredibly dull and looks to the hold's occasional visitors to provide some interest. The dragon interrogates newcomers, hoping to hear something other than the same tales of conquest Vrakir's armies always tell. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check can command Kalimrax's rapt attention for up to 1 hour. The dragon threatens to eat any character who fails to hold her interest.

Kalimrax attacks any character she sees trying to enter the hold by stealth or by force, but she doesn't pursue characters into the hold's interior. If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, Kalimrax retreats to her lair in area B10.

##### Cranes

Three large, wooden cranes extend over the harbor. They are used to lift cargo unloaded from the boats in area B7 to the upper yard for transport to areas B19 and B21. The cranes' platforms also provide the only means for dockhands and traders to move between area B6 and area B7, 40 feet below. A creature can use an action to raise or lower the crane's platform 5 feet. Each crane can support up to 5,000 pounds.

##### Outbuildings

The yard's four outbuildings have 2-foot-thick walls of basalt blocks and 10-foot-high ceilings roofed with slate. The smaller buildings (area B6a) are littered with ropes and loading hooks and contain stairwells that lead to the hold's main storage rooms (areas B19 and B21). The larger buildings (area B6b) each contain a dozen cots and serve as quarters for the hold's visitors, most frequently Klax and her traders.

If the characters arrive at the hold while the traders are present, one of the larger buildings is inhabited by Klax (chaotic neutral [cambion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md)) and eight traders ([commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). The traders are indifferent to the characters, although Klax is protective of her business arrangement with [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) and turns in the party to the hold's defenders if the characters seem likely to threaten that arrangement.

#### B7: Harbor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the stronghold's center is a harbor of lava connected by an inlet to the main river. A quay along the harbor's western edge is lined with iron mooring posts, while wooden cranes tower overhead. At the eastern edge, a stream of lava cascades into the harbor from the cliff above.
^4f0

The harbor is primarily used by Klax's traders to make their regular supply runs. The traders unload their cargo onto the platforms suspended by the cranes, allowing for transport to the yard above.

##### Boats

If the characters arrive while the traders are at the hold, two boats are moored at the quay. The boats are 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, with wooden decks and iron-plated hulls fashioned to resemble dragon turtles. The boats are magically immune to fire damage and remain cool to the touch, even when floating in lava. Each boat has six flipper-shaped iron paddles protruding from its hull, which are controlled by levers on the boat's deck.

#### B8: Cliff Towers

These two towers stand at opposite ends of the fortress's high rock platform. Each one can be described as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This imposing tower is buttressed by the stone cliffs of the stronghold's upper level. Its battlements have a commanding view of the hold's upper and lower yards.
^4f3

One [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) is on guard in each of these towers, occasionally leaving the tower to walk the battlements of the adjoining curtain walls. Each erinyes is hostile to anyone attempting to climb the outer walls but is otherwise indifferent to the goings-on in the yards below.

#### B9: Harbor Towers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two mighty towers flank the entrance to the fortress's harbor. A great steel chain stretches between the towers, barring access from the lava river beyond.
^4f5

Two [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) guard access to the harbor, one in each tower. These guards are hostile to anyone attempting to enter or leave the hold via the river without [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md)'s approval. The erinyes admit Klax and her traders after a cursory inspection of their cargo, although the erinyes become suspicious if the traders aren't following their usual schedule.

Each tower contains a large winch for raising and lowering the chain that controls access to the harbor. The chain is effective only if both sides are raised, and it takes 3 actions to fully raise or lower one end of the chain.

#### B10: Efreeti Face

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Carved into the slope of the volcano is the enormous visage of a scowling efreeti. A stream of lava issues from the efreeti's open mouth, falling to the yard below, where it pools before spilling into the harbor.
^4f7

The efreeti's mouth is the main entrance to the hold's interior and is primarily used by Vrakir and [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md), who can easily navigate its 20-foot elevation above the yard. A steel chain ladder coiled in a corner of the efreeti's mouth can be lowered to allow access for non-flying creatures.

Above the carved efreeti face, a fissure in the volcano's slope leads into a small cave not visible from the stronghold below. Kalimrax lairs here, returning for a few hours every evening to rest and check on her hoard, which consists of the plunder Vrakir allows her to take as payment for her service.

##### Treasure

Kalimrax's lair contains 14,213 sp, 7,029 gp, 923 pp, eighteen gemstones (500 gp each), a fan made of couatl feathers (1,250 gp), a [figurine of wondrous power (bronze griffon)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-bronze-griffon.md), and a [mace of terror](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mace-of-terror.md).

#### B11: Guard Room

This small chamber is lit by a glowing brazier and furnished only with a pair of iron stools sitting next to a stone block that serves as a crude table.

Two [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) are always on guard here. They react with suspicion toward the characters, as visitors don't usually come through this area, and become hostile if the characters attempt to force their way to or from area B4.

##### Secret Door

A pressure plate in the corner of the floor behind the brazier opens a secret door leading to area B12.

#### B12: Secret Passage

This hidden corridor has a secret door at each end of it.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this darkened corridor is coated with a fine layer of black dust, and the air is stale and hot.
^4fc

The duergar created this passage to access the cells in case the prisoners ever managed to take control of the prison yard. The passage has never seen use, and Brimstone Hold's other defenders don't know it exists. The secret doors at each end are readily visible from inside the hallway and don't require an ability check to find.

#### B13: Prison Cells

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door to this chamber bolts from the outside. Inside, bundles of rags have been gathered into squalid sleeping pallets.
^4fe

At night, twenty prisoners ([commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) sleep in these cells. During the day, the cells are empty.

#### B14: Large Prison Cell

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door to this chamber bolts from the outside. Inside, a pile of sackcloth and bones lies in one corner of the otherwise bare room, and the air is thick with the stench of filth. Sobbing on the filthy mound is an ogre wearing a loincloth.
^500

A chaotic neutral [ogre](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) named Yug occupies this cell. For the past three days, Yug has been confined here for breaking a duergar's arm in anger over the theft of Gruk-Gruk, a crude rag doll.

Yug is initially wary of the characters but becomes talkative if they seem sympathetic to his plight. If the characters find and return Gruk-Gruk to Yug, the ogre happily aids them in any way he can.

#### B15: Erinyes Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this chamber is covered in smoldering cinders, heating the room like an oven. Several chain hammocks are slung from the walls.
^502

Three [erinyes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) lounge in their hammocks here, resting between shifts patrolling the walls. The erinyes are immediately suspicious of the characters, as visitors don't usually come here. Unless the characters provide a compelling reason for their intrusion and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the erinyes try to capture the characters for questioning.

#### B16: Common Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is furnished with two long trestle tables and several benches. Tin plates and cups are set on one of the tables next to several barrels with iron spigots jutting from their sides.
^504

The duergar take their meals here. All but one of the barrels contain water. The last barrel holds dregs of sour beer.

#### B17: Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large iron stove occupies one side of this room, while a workbench stands against the opposite wall. Sacks of flour and baskets of tubers are piled in the corners. Two gray-skinned dwarves use iron spoons to sip from a stewpot, then begin arguing.
^506

Two [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) are busily preparing the hold's next meal: tuber stew. They are arguing about how spicy the stew ought to be. If the duergar notice the party, they assume the characters are members of Klax's crew and start instructing them where to put the new supplies. Only if the characters ignore the cooks' instructions do the duergar become suspicious, attacking while shouting to the duergar in area B18 if the characters can't justify their presence.

##### Treasure

The duergar keep a vial of [midnight tears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/midnight-tears.md) poison (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") among the pots of seasoning on the table.

#### B18: Duergar Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber is lined with stone bunks that protrude from the walls. Two iron chests stand in the back corners of the room.
^509

Six [duergar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) are sleeping here on the stone slabs that serve as their beds. They wear their armor and keep their weapons within arm's reach. The sound of normal movement doesn't wake them, but they are roused by the sounds of battle or other loud noises in areas B15–B19.

The duergar are alarmed if they wake to find the characters here and shout to the duergar in area B17. They demand the characters explain themselves and attack if the characters attempt to escape without giving an account of their presence.

##### Treasure

The iron chests are unlocked. Each chest contains ten spare sets of plain, dwarf-sized clothing. One chest also holds a small black [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing two eight-sided obsidian dice (50 gp) and a dagger with a malachite blade (250 gp). The other chest also contains a [potion of resistance (fire)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-fire-resistance.md) in a vial made from a hollowed-out dragon's fang.

#### B19: Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Boxes, barrels, crates, and sacks are piled high in this chamber.
^50c

This is the fortress's primary storage area. Most of Klax's deliveries are carried here by the dockhands via the staircase from the outbuilding above (area B6a). The supplies primarily consist of food, water, timber, rope, and raw iron.

#### B20: Salamander Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this room is coated in solidified lava that resembles the undulations of waves on the sea. Lounging between the lava formations are two serpentine creatures with heat ripples and smoke rising from their bodies.
^50e

Two [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) rest in these barracks, their bodies coiled to nestle into the depressions in the solidified lava. If the characters aren't escorted by other members of the hold, the salamanders assume the characters are a threat and attack immediately.

#### B21: Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Boxes and crates are neatly stacked along one wall of this chamber, while iron braziers and spare furniture line the opposite wall.
^510

This storage area contains supplies for the efreet's chambers. The items are delivered by Klax's crew via the staircase from the outbuilding above (area B6a).

##### Treasure

Among the supplies are twelve 20-pound crates of fine silk (1,000 gp each) and a small chest containing six blocks of rich incense (250 gp each).

#### B22: Antechamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A fountain of lava wells up from the floor of this antechamber, pooling in the room's center before running along a broad channel cut in the stone tile. A walkway along the pool's edge grants access to a grand set of brass doors behind the fountain, as well as to smaller iron doors along the side walls.
> 
> Coiled before the brass doors are two serpentine creatures clutching spears. Floating ten feet above them is a spherical creature with a large central eye and ten eyestalks.
^513

Two [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) stand guard here along with a [beholder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) known as the Eye of the Efreet. These creatures are hostile unless the characters arrive with an escort, in which case the characters are directed to area B23 to make an appointment to see [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md). Once the characters proceed to area B25, the salamanders accompany them and remain there for the duration of their visit.

#### B23: Administrative Office

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this office are decorated with paintings depicting an array of otherworldly landscapes. At its center stands a heavy desk engraved with grotesque, fiendish figures, and seated at the desk is a slender, bipedal creature wearing a red robe, a sparkly ring, and a fez. The creature has the head and tawny fur of a fox.
^515

Nebukath the [arcanaloth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/arcanaloth.md) sees to the hold's administrative tasks. Nebukath is initially indifferent toward the characters and presumes they have come seeking an audience with [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md). The arcanaloth languidly informs the characters that the efreeti is too busy to meet with them.

If the characters reveal their true purpose, Nebukath perks up and excitedly offers to aid them. The arcanaloth knows the routines of all the hold's inhabitants and can provide the characters with an alibi or escort if they need one. However, the terms of its magically binding employment contract prevent Nebukath from taking direct action against Vrakir, his forces, or his property (for example, by attacking the hold's defenders).

If Nebukath discovers the party's purpose, the arcanaloth follows them closely, waiting for the characters to steal the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md). Once the book is in the party's possession, the terms of Nebukath's contract no longer prevent the arcanaloth from seizing the artifact, and Nebukath attempts to steal the book from the characters.

##### Treasure

The office's three paintings are worth 100 gp each, or five times that to a collector of planar antiquities. Nebukath wears a [ring of telekinesis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-telekinesis.md) and a platinum brooch set with tourmaline (1,000 gp).

#### B24: Nebukath's Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In this room, a bookshelf and armchair stand alongside a simple bed fitted with silken sheets.
^518

When Nebukath isn't working in area B23, the arcanaloth rests here. A small brass bell attached to a rope in area B26 alerts Nebukath anytime they're needed by the efreet.

##### Secret Door

A creature can open the secret door leading to area B26 by pulling on a false book on the lowest rack of the bookshelf, which causes the adjoining section of wall to swing open (the door can be opened normally from the other side).

##### Treasure

Among the arcanaloth's library is a volume entitled The Blood War, which describes the unending conflict between devils of the Nine Hells and the demons of the Abyss. The tome is worth 500 gp to a collector. Scribbled in the margin of one page is the sequence for a teleportation circle that leads to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells.

#### B25: Audience Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Pillars of writhing flame wrought in stone hold up the vaulted ceiling of this great hall. In the center, a magnificent, gilded throne gleams like the sun itself, reflecting the light of the roaring braziers at its foot.
^51c

![Jarazoun the Efreeti](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/104-13-005-jarazoun-the-efreeti.webp#center)

If he hasn't been encountered and defeated elsewhere, the [efreeti](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) sits on the throne, acting as master of Brimstone Hold in Vrakir's absence. [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) has little patience for the business of running a stronghold and leaves most of the decision-making to Nebukath. The stronghold's denizens see [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) for the petty tyrant he is, but they obey him out of fear of his patron, Vrakir.

If the characters come before [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) posing as visitors with legitimate business at the hold, the efreeti treats them with indifference. He enjoys lording his power over petitioners and denies any requests the characters make dismissively, relenting only if plied with substantial wealth or flattery—a very rare magic item, 10,000 gp worth of treasure, or a successful DC 25 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check suffices.

If the characters insult [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) or reveal their true purpose, the efreeti becomes hostile and shouts for the salamanders in area B22 to apprehend the characters and imprison them in area B13. If the party resists, [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) fights desperately, fearing Vrakir's wrath if the characters were to escape.

##### Secret Door

A secret door hidden in the north wall leads to area B26.

##### Treasure

[Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) wears a gold chain of office studded with fire opals (5,000 gp) and eight gold rings set with precious stones (250 gp each). He also carries the key to area B28.

#### B26: Lounge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this chamber are draped with silk, and its floor is festooned with cushions. A fountain in the room's center burbles with ruby-red liquid, while an ornately wrought brazier stands in the corner.
^520

[Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) entertains favored guests here. The ruby liquid is firewine imported from the City of Brass. Any creature that drinks the wine gains 15 temporary hit points. The creature must finish a long rest before it can gain this benefit again.

##### Secret Doors

A secret door in the west wall leads to area B24, and a secret door in one corner of the south wall leads to area B25.

##### Treasure

The brazier is a [brazier of commanding fire elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/brazier-of-commanding-fire-elementals.md). Its command word, ilkath keri (Ignan for "blaze brightly"), is inscribed along the brazier's inside rim.

#### B27: Vestibule

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Woven carpets line this corridor, which has doors leading in all four directions. Two large statues of efreet warriors stand sentinel here, one at either end of the corridor.
^524

The doors to areas B28 and B29 are both locked. [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) carries the key to area B28, while Vrakir carries the key to area B29. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to pick either lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

##### Statues

The statues are two [stone golems](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) that are normally quiescent and don't react to the characters' presence. However, the golems are magically attuned to the door to area B29 and become hostile if a creature attempts to open the door by any means other than using Vrakir's key. A character who succeeds on their ability check to pick the lock by 10 or more avoids triggering the golems. Entering area B29 by using magic (such as the [passwall](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md) spell) to bypass the door entirely doesn't trigger the golems.

#### B28: Jarazoun's Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large bed with brass posts and silk curtains dominates this chamber. In the corner, a lyre engraved with elaborate figures leans on the wall next to a cushioned stool.
^527

[Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) is usually here when he isn't conducting business in area B25 or entertaining visitors in area B26.

##### Treasure

The lyre is an [instrument of the bards (Cli lyre)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/instrument-of-the-bards-cli-lyre.md) decorated with carvings of phoenixes. [Jarazoun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarazoun-kftgv.md) fancies himself a musician but is unable to attune to the instrument.

#### B29: Vrakir's Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The luxurious appointments of this palatial bedchamber are at odds with its back wall. There, scorch marks and cracked masonry radiate from a grotesque face carved into the stone, its forehead set with a blood-red gem. Sitting on a desk off to one side is a black tome, its cover emblazoned with fell iconography.
^52a

The tome resembles the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md) but is actually a trained [mimic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md). Any character who examines the tome and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes it as a fraud. The mimic attacks any creature that touches or attacks it.

The room's back wall appears solid but is the anchor for a magical doorway to area B30: the demiplane where Vrakir keeps the real [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md). Anyone examining the wall using [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) can see the outline of the door. The scorch marks and cracked masonry are due to the book's corrupting influence, which seeps out every time the doorway is opened.

The key to opening the door is the gemstone set in the wall carving. The gem is trapped with a 6th-level [glyph of warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) spell. The glyph casts [disintegrate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disintegrate.md) on any creature that touches the gem without speaking Vrakir's motto: atka ignari. While touching the gem, a creature can take an action to open the door to area B30 as if the creature had cast the [demiplane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/demiplane.md) spell; this causes the face in the wall to stretch its mouth wide as a shimmering gray portal appears within. Removing the gem from the wall causes the doorway to disappear, trapping anything in area B30 in the demiplane until the gem is replaced or someone else accesses the room with a [demiplane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/demiplane.md) spell.

##### Treasure

If removed from the wall, the gem continues to radiate magic but doesn't otherwise function. It is worth 5,000 gp.

#### B30: Vrakir's Demiplane

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> On the floor of this otherwise empty room rests an open book, its ancient pages rustling ominously despite the lack of breeze. The flagstones around it are charred and cracked, and the room's walls are veined with narrow fissures that disappear into darkness.
^52d

![The Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/keys-from-the-golden-vault/img/105-13-006-book-of-vile-darkness.webp#center)

If the characters had a relatively easy time getting here, add two [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [nycaloths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nycaloth.md) as guards. The nycaloths are mercenaries hired by Vrakir to protect the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md), and their [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) spells end when they attack.

##### Treasure

The [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness.md) is so blasphemous that its mere presence erodes the demiplane Vrakir made to contain it. Review the [artifact's description](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness.md) in the "Dungeon Master's Guide", then replace its Random Properties with the following preset ones:

- **Circle of Death.** While attuned to the book, you can cast [circle of death](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/circle-of-death.md) (save DC 20) from it as an action. After you cast the spell, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1–5, you can't use this property again until the next dawn.  
- **Condition Immunities.** While attuned to the book, you can't be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).  
- **Evil Presence.** The book houses an evil spirit that is hostile toward you. When you become attuned to the book, the spirit tries to leave the book and enter your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding spirit is banished using magic such as the [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) spell. The banished spirit returns to the book.  

## Conclusion

After the characters escape Brimstone Hold, they might find themselves pursued by Nebukath, Vrakir, or both. The former is focused solely on obtaining the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md), while the latter seeks vengeance against the characters regardless of what happens to the artifact. Meanwhile, the book has its own designs, and it might subvert the aims of the party's patron or find its way back into the party's possession if it senses a character is ripe for corruption.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, they must deliver the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md) to their contact. Once they do, the organization rewards the characters with a very rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment. The item is delivered to the characters the next day.

### Further Adventures

Recovering the [Book of Vile Darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book-of-vile-darkness-variant-kftgv.md) could be the first in a series of adventures revolving around the party's efforts to contain or destroy the artifact—efforts that might involve courting the aid of powerful celestials, unearthing ancient spells of binding, or undergoing trials of purification.

Meanwhile, even without the book, Vrakir and his armies remain a threat. The characters might have to fend off a reprisal by the efreeti's forces before traveling to the Elemental Plane of Fire to deal with Vrakir himself.

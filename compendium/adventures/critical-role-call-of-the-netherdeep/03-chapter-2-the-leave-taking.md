# Chapter 2: The Leave-Taking
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep, p. 37* 

In this chapter, the characters learn more about the events that occurred in the Emerald Grotto and the mythic significance of the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md). Following this discovery, the characters depart Jigow and travel across Xhorhas toward Bazzoxan, a bleak military outpost guarding a fortress of evil.

Most of this chapter deals with the characters' journey across the wastes and the challenges and friendly strangers they encounter along the way. Whether the rivals accompany the characters or strike out on their own depends on the relationship between the two parties and the rivals' curiosity about the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md).

![Five adventurers journey a...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/critical-role-call-of-the-netherdeep/img/018-02-001-intro-splash.webp#center "Five adventurers journey across the wastes of Xhorhas, watched by the moons Catha and Ruidus")

## Running This Chapter

The journey can begin in one of three ways, depending on how chapter 1 ended:

- **Heroic Quest..** In the Emerald Grotto, the characters obtained the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md) and experienced the vision from the Apotheon. In this scenario, they are approached by Elder Ushru, who senses that the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md) is a powerful magic item and suggests the characters undertake a journey to learn more about it.  
- **Ours by Right..** If the rivals experienced the vision and claimed the jewel, they take the role of the heroes of the story, with the characters as allies or as interlopers who want the jewel for themselves. If the characters meet with Elder Ushru, they learn that the rivals have embarked on a quest of monumental significance—perhaps compelling the characters to pursue them and claim the destiny that they believe is rightfully theirs.  
- **Warring Destinies..** If the characters got the jewel but grievously insulted the rivals (or even killed one or more of them), the rivals try to steal the jewel in the middle of the night and begin the journey to Bazzoxan themselves.  

In any event, it takes the characters several days to reach their destination. Use the Xhorhas Encounters table later in the chapter to spice up the journey.

The trek is interrupted by a chance for the characters to rest at a caravan stop along the Emerald Loop—where the rivals might also be camping for the night. This midway encounter gives the characters a chance to make friends with the rivals or steal the jewel from them.

## After the Festival

The events of this chapter begin at dawn on the day after the Festival of Merit. If the characters claimed the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md) from the Emerald Grotto, start with "Heroic Quest." If the rivals claimed the jewel instead, start with "Ours by Right." If the characters acquired the jewel but made enemies of the rivals, start with "Warring Destinies."

### Heroic Quest

Read the following to start this episode:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Daybreak comes with a knock on the door of your room. The voice of Elder Ushru comes through the door. "Travelers? I wish to tell you something of grave import. Will you have a morning meal with me?" He pauses, and then sheepishly adds, "I do have the right room, don't I?"
^0b6

Ushru invites the characters for breakfast at the Unbroken Tusk inn. At first he is jovial and conversational with the characters, but then his tone becomes deadly serious:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "A vision came to me last night. A golden amulet rose to the surface of a pool of blood, and countless hands lunged upward out of the blood to grasp it. In turn, all the hands fell back into the pool until only one remained. The one whose hand claimed the amulet was a handsome man with curly hair and a somber expression. He turned to me and said, 'They must find me. The ones from the grotto.' Tell me, did anything happen to you in that place that would help me understand this vision?"
^0b7

If the characters offer information, Ushru doesn't recognize the name Alyxian—no living creature remembers the name of the Apotheon. Nevertheless, if the characters tell Ushru the truth about what happened to them in the Emerald Grotto, he gravely encourages them to travel eastward to Bazzoxan, describing it as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Bazzoxan is a grim town under the control of the Aurora Watch, not a pleasant place to visit. But if what you tell me is true, what you have found is a Vestige of Divergence, an enchanted relic from the time of the Calamity known as the *Jewel of Three Prayers*. People do not stumble upon Vestiges without a reason. And there is no place in Xhorhas where the memory of the Calamity lingers more strongly than in Bazzoxan."
^0b8

Elder Ushru urges the characters to be truthful because they might have embarked on a course of action that will change their lives. If they refuse to be forthcoming with information, he sighs, shrugs, and bids them good day. He says they're welcome to stay in Jigow as long as they want, if that's what they prefer to do.

#### Friendly Rivalry

If the characters show little interest in learning more about the jewel, perhaps their rivals don't share that attitude. If the rivals were present at the prayer site in the Emerald Grotto, they didn't experience the vision of the Apotheon; instead, they heard only a muffled voice, as if the speaker were underwater. Nevertheless, what they heard was enough to make them curious.

If the characters are on friendly terms with the rivals, the rivals meet up with them soon after the characters' breakfast with Elder Ushru.

[Ayo Jabe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ayo-jabe-tier-1-crcotn.md) doesn't mince words; she wants to know what they found in the grotto. If she gets the sense that the characters have stumbled onto something big, her eyes grow wide. She decides that she and her group want a piece of the action and proposes that they travel with the characters, saying that there's safety in numbers. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check realizes that she isn't hiding anything and wants nothing more than to be a part of a grand adventure.

The other rivals have their own opinions:

- [Dermot](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/dermot-wurder-tier-1-crcotn.md) is genuinely concerned for the characters' well-being. He mentions that he heard what sounded like a voice in the grotto and wants to know if the characters heard it too.  
- [Galsariad](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/galsariad-ardyth-tier-1-crcotn.md) is curious about what the characters learned in their vision and is eager for the characters to share any magical secrets they might have discovered.  
- [Irvan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/irvan-wastewalker-tier-1-crcotn.md) has no interest in what happened in the grotto, but he is interested in learning what the jewel can do.  
- [Maggie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/maggie-keeneyes-tier-1-crcotn.md) agrees with anyone who expresses concern for the characters but doesn't say much on her own. She has her suspicions that more happened than what they have related during the event in the grotto, but she won't push them if they don't want to reveal the full truth.  

### Ours by Right

If the rivals acquired the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md) and experienced the vision of Alyxian, they are the ones approached by Elder Ushru in the morning, and they are the ones who are encouraged to travel to Bazzoxan. In this case, read the following to the players:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You're eating breakfast at the Unbroken Tusk while locals chat around you. Through the cacophony, one voice catches your attention.
> 
> "Rumor has it they're going to Rosohna to sell it. Elder Ushru met with them and everything, kept whispering while pointing at a huge, shiny amulet on the table. He was talking about 'destiny' and other heroic-like words. I think they were the group who won the grand finale yesterday. The amulet looked plenty magical, but even if it isn't, it'd be worth a fortune. Yeah, they're traveling down the Emerald Loop by now."
^0bb

Gossip about the rivals' meeting with Elder Ushru has spread quickly throughout Jigow. Everyone is talking about the expensive-looking, possibly magical amulet they found in the Emerald Grotto, and the characters are bound to catch word of it. People are saying that the jewel would probably sell for over 1,000 gold pieces—maybe twice that if it's magical, and twice that again if the sellers were to make the long, oversea journey to a trade hub like the desert metropolis of Ank'Harel.

Nothing is forcing the characters to chase down the rivals, but the thought of losing out on such a prize is enough to motivate most adventurers. If they aren't interested in chasing down the rivals, see the "Refusing the Call" sidebar for advice on how to continue this adventure.

> [!note] Refusing the Call
> 
> If the characters don't want to follow the plot or travel to Bazzoxan, you will need to create side encounters in Xhorhas that will guide them in that direction. The characters can find jobs in Jigow as caravan guards, mercenaries, or bounty hunters; you can use the Xhorhas Encounters table later in this chapter to determine how they are challenged.
^refusing-the-call

### Warring Destinies

If the characters won the Festival of Merit but made enemies of the rival party, either by insulting them or by injuring or killing one or more of them, the rivals try to get revenge by stealing the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md) from the characters while they sleep.

The rivals' plan is to gather outside the inn where the characters are staying. One rival then sneaks into the characters' room at the inn and searches for the jewel. If the thief doesn't return after an hour, the rivals travel to the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop (described later in this chapter) and wait up to seven days for their missing companion.

#### Who's the Thief?

The likely thief is Irvan, who sees the jewel not as a mystical item but rather a treasure. It could also be the shadowy Galsariad if the magical nature of the jewel is made explicit. If Ayo was pushed to the brink by the murder of one of her comrades, she could be the thief.

The thief wears a thick black cloak with a hood and mask. A character who sees the thief can use an action to try to recognize them through their disguise, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

The attempted theft has three possible outcomes:

- **Caught Sleeping..** If none of the characters has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher, the thief escapes with the jewel. The rival party heads to Rosohna. Along the way, they receive a vision from Alyxian that directs them to Bazzoxan.  
- **Slow to Act..** A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 to 18 notices the thief after they've found the jewel and as they're leaving out the window. The thief notices the character on the way out and runs toward their rendezvous point (area J10). See "Pursuing the Thief" below if the characters give chase.  
- **Quick to Act..** A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 19 or higher notices the thief while they're searching the room, but before they've found the jewel. This character can sneak up on the thief by making a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check, catching the thief by surprise. Otherwise, the thief notices that they've been spotted and leaps out the nearest window. The thief then runs to rejoin their friends at the edge of town. See "Pursuing the Thief" below if the characters give chase.  

#### Pursuing the Thief

A character who notices the thief can try to capture them. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to catch up to the thief followed by a successful [grapple](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) check (see the "Player's Handbook"). If either check fails, the thief escapes.

If the character doesn't pursue the thief immediately and instead spends time rousing their allies, grabbing a weapon, or donning armor, the thief escapes.

#### Questioning the Thief

If the characters catch the thief, the rival refuses to give away their plan as long as their attitude toward the party remains hostile (see the rules for "social interaction" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). But if a character succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the rival shares the plan willingly. The rival also shares the plan under duress if a character threatens them with harm and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check. You can grant advantage or impose disadvantage on either check if you think the thief would be especially responsive or resistant to persuasion or intimidation.

A rival captured by the party tries to escape at the earliest opportunity, perhaps when most or all of the characters are asleep or distracted. If the rival is bound with rope, the rival can escape their bonds with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. If manacles are used instead, the DC is 20. If the check fails, the rival can try again after 1 hour.

## Road to Bazzoxan

To reach Bazzoxan, the characters must follow the Emerald Loop south before turning east onto the Hallowed Path. These dirt roads are shown on the accompanying map of Xhorhas. Although the roads are well patrolled by the Kryn Dynasty, the wastes are still dangerous: wandering scavengers, fearsome megafauna, and plenty of other threats await foolish travelers who venture too far from the road.

> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/critical-role-call-of-the-netherdeep/img/020-map-2-1-the-emerald-gulch-player.webp#gallery)

### Travel Pace

The first leg of this journey takes the characters through the wastes of Xhorhas, a stark landscape roamed by mastodons and packs of moorbounders. In the second leg, the characters enter the valley known as the Barbed Fields, where spines of stone ranging from 10 to 30 feet tall linger as eerie reminders of the Calamity. Between the two halves of the journey is a caravan stop where the characters can rest, buy items, and interact with friendly nonplayer characters.

How long the journey takes and the number of random encounters that occur depend on whether the characters are moving at a normal, fast, or slow pace (see the rules for "travel pace" in the "Player's Handbook"):

- **Normal Pace..** The journey takes 12 days, and the characters have six random encounters: four encounters prior to reaching the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop (where they arrive at the end of the eighth day) followed by two more encounters.  
- **Fast Pace..** The journey takes 9 days, and the characters have four random encounters: three encounters prior to reaching the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop (where they arrive at the end of the sixth day) followed by one more encounter.  
- **Slow Pace..** The journey takes 15 days, and the characters have eight random encounters: five encounters prior to reaching the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop (where they arrive at the end of the tenth day) followed by three more encounters.  

### Random Encounters

The Xhorhas Encounters table presents events that can take place during the trek to Bazzoxan. Unless specified, you decide what time of day each encounter occurs. Encounters marked with an asterisk (*) are unique and can occur only once, while the others can happen multiple times. If you roll an encounter that can't be repeated, roll again for a new result, or choose one you like.

In addition to random encounters, two encounters occur at specific points, as described later in the chapter:

- **Rivals' Reunion..** This encounter occurs if the rivals left Jigow ahead of the characters and the characters travel at a fast pace to catch up with them on the way to Bazzoxan.  
- **Emerald Loop Caravan Stop..** This encounter occurs at the point where the Emerald Loop meets the Hallowed Path—unless the characters choose not to rest at the caravan stop.

#### A Lucky Break

Just off the road ahead, the characters spot the corpse of a [gloomstalker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gloomstalker-egw.md) (see appendix A). Even in death, its corpse is covered in roiling, wispy shadows. The grass around the creature has been trampled flat.

A character who examines the gloomstalker corpse, which is riddled with broken arrow shafts, can make a DC 16 Wisdom ([Medicine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a success, they determine that the creature also has a serious burn along its underside, suggesting it was likely killed by archers and some sort of magic that dealt fire or radiant damage.

##### Irvan's Ring

If the rivals are traveling ahead of the characters, they were involved in this battle. (Otherwise, the gloomstalker was killed by an Aurora Watch patrol.) A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check finds a line of footprints leading through the trampled battlefield and ending at a withered oak tree. Beneath the tree, in plain view, is a silver ring with a small sapphire. This ring belongs to Irvan Wastewalker, who lost it crawling away from the battle after he was wounded by the gloomstalker. The ring is worth 250 gp, and Irvan becomes friendly toward any character who returns it to him.

#### Aurora Watch Patrol

The Aurora Watch of the Kryn Dynasty patrols the roads in Xhorhas, protecting travelers from both the monstrous denizens of the wastes and unscrupulous individuals who might lurk along the road. Each time this encounter occurs, the characters meet a different patrol. Choose one of the following options:

- **Patrol at Rest..** The characters come across six lawful neutral Aurora Watch [veterans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) (a mix of lawful good drow, humans, and orcs) who are resting at a campsite just off the road. Clearly in good spirits, they invite the characters to join them. Traveling with this patrol is a lawful good, drow [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) who also serves as a cook. If the characters take a long rest with the patrol, the food they were given the night before grants them `1d10` "temporary hit points" when they awaken the next day.  
- **Patrol in Battle..** The characters see six lawful neutral Aurora Watch [veterans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) (a mix of lawful good drow, humans, and orcs) fighting a [hezrou](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/hezrou.md). If the characters help the Aurora Watch slay the demon, the soldiers thank them, give them a total of 50 gp as a reward, and promise to commend them to Taskhand [Verin Thelyss](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) when the patrol returns to Bazzoxan. If the characters do nothing to help, the soldiers slay the demon, but only after one soldier is killed and two others are reduced to 0 hit points (one stable, the other dying).  
- **Lost Patrol..** On the road in front of the characters are the bodies of six Aurora Watch soldiers near the corpse of a hezrou that is slowly dissolving into black ichor. Two [shadow demons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/shadow-demon.md) and two [quasits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) lurk beneath the soldiers' corpses, waiting for more prey to arrive. They fight to the death.  

#### Crashed Wagon

The characters spot an overturned wagon in a ditch on one side of the road. The ox that pulled the wagon is nowhere to be found (it tore free of its harness and wandered away). Lying beneath the wagon are the bodies of three merchants—two drow and an orc—who died in the crash. Around the orc's broken neck is a small key that unlocks an iron strongbox in the wagon (see "Treasure" below).

Characters who investigate the interior of the wagon disturb three [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [will-o'-wisps](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md), which illuminate and attack. If any of the wisps are killed, the others decide the characters are too much of a threat and flee on their next turn. If all three wisps are defeated, the spirits of the slain travelers grant one character of your choice a *charm of heroism* (see the rules for "supernatural gifts" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

##### Treasure

After the will-o'-wisps are dealt with, a character who searches the wagon can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a success, they find a locked iron box containing 50 gp and a [potion of giant strength (hill)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md). A character who lacks the proper key can use an action and [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

![Rival adventurers camp nea...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/critical-role-call-of-the-netherdeep/img/021-02-002-rival-adventurers.webp#center "Rival adventurers camp near the bones of a mastodon in the wastes of Xhorhas")

#### Demonic Carrion

The characters encounter the corpse of an udaak—one of the enormous, ape-like demons that have prowled the wastes of Xhorhas since the Calamity. The demonic corpse, which is punctured with countless spears and axes, is slowly melting into a pool of black ichor. Surrounding the body are the corpses of two dozen humans wearing hide armor, as well as the bodies of the warriors' horses. What looks like a carrion bird circles the battlefield at a height of 300 feet.

The carrion bird is a [vrock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) that has been feeding on the mortal flesh strewn about the battlefield. It swoops down to attack characters who disturb any of the corpses. In addition, three [quasits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) hide in the udaak's fur and attack non-demons that come within 10 feet of the udaak's melting corpse.

A character who investigates the tracks around this battlefield can make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. On a success, the character sees the tracks of a horse that apparently escaped the carnage. The tracks lead in the direction of the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop.

##### Treasure

A character who investigates the carnage for at least 10 minutes can make a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a success, they find a [+1 dagger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) embedded in the hide of the udaak. The dagger is inscribed with the name of its owner, Kierchaly Wastewalker. The characters might later learn that this warrior is among the dead, but his daughter and son survived, and they are now at the caravan stop.

#### Feast for the Eyes

The characters see a [gloomstalker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gloomstalker-egw.md) (see appendix A) antagonizing `1d3` [mammoths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md) that are moving slowly across the wastes, minding their own business. The creatures are `3d6 × 100` feet away from the characters when the encounter begins.

The gloomstalker shrieks as it descends upon a mammoth with claws bared, but its attacks have little effect. Frustrated, it ascends into the sky and spots the party. The gloomstalker lets out another shriek as it flies toward the characters, eager to feast on their flesh. The characters have at least a round or two before the gloomstalker gets close enough to harm them. Hungry and hostile, the gloomstalker fights to the death. Assume that the creature has recharged Shriek by the time it reaches the characters.

Each time the gloomstalker uses Shriek during the battle against the characters, `1d6` [skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) of dead human soldiers burst up out of the ground within 30 feet of the characters and attack them, acting on their own initiative count. Skeletons that aren't reduced to 0 hit points collapse into inanimate piles of bones after 10 minutes or when the gloomstalker is slain.

#### Ill Omen

While the party is camping at night, one of the characters sees Exandria's smaller moon flare with bright red light. The moon, which has appeared as a slim crescent throughout the night, suddenly becomes full. When this happens, each character becomes cursed for the next 24 hours. While cursed in this way, a character has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The effect can be ended on a character by any magic that removes a curse.

The characters have another encounter immediately after they begin traveling the next day. Roll again on the Xhorhas Encounters table, or choose an encounter you like.

#### Moorbounder Mayhem

The characters hear a wild yell. In the distance, they see a lawful neutral, tiefling [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) named Justice on the back of a [moorbounder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/moorbounder-egw.md) (see appendix A) and hanging on for dear life as the creature snarls and bucks about. Two [bristled moorbounders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/bristled-moorbounder-egw.md) (see appendix A) are circling the imperiled tiefling. Justice can hang on for another minute at most, and the moment he touches the ground, the bristled moorbounders intend to tear him limb from limb.

Justice is a trained moorbounder rider, and the beast he is clinging to is Rice Pudding, his beloved steed. Rice Pudding was terrified by the other moorbounders that ambushed them along the road. If the characters scare off the attacking moorbounders, Justice and Rice Pudding will be saved. A character can use an action to try to scare off a moorbounder, doing so with a successful DC 21 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check.

Justice is a scout for a caravan that is heading toward the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop. He elects not to accompany the characters, but he does promise to give them a reward once they reach the caravan stop. (If the characters have this encounter after they pass the caravan stop, Justice's group is traveling west, in the opposite direction from the characters' route, and Justice instead rewards them with 5 gp per character.)

#### Roadside Raiders

On a rare sunny day in the wastes, characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher see a cloud of dust being kicked up about half a mile down the road—and it continues to head toward them. A few minutes later, the characters are surrounded by human bandits mounted on bedraggled horses. These bandits call themselves the Road Raiders. Their leader, a grizzled man named Postraeck, is a neutral evil [bandit captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) who rides an imposing black [warhorse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md). Postraeck is better known as Six-Knives because of the six daggers he carries on his person at all times, each of which has a name (Boneshaver, Gleam, Grudge, Jabby, Pierce, and Tickles). His fellow riders are ten [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) (lawful evil humans) mounted on [riding horses](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md).

Six-Knives claims that he's a Kryn tax collector and that he needs each of the characters to cough up 25 gp for the "road 'n' infer-structure tax." No such tax exists, and the characters don't need to make any kind of check to glean that these hoodlums are not tax collectors. If the characters pay, Six-Knives tips his hat with a chuckle, and the Road Raiders gallop away.

If the characters refuse to pay, Six-Knives clicks his tongue and rears his horse. "Let's loosen their purse-strings, y'all!" he roars, ordering the bandits to attack. All of them, including Six-Knives, are cowards, and any bandit reduced to fewer than half their hit points tries to flee in their next turn.

Future occurrences of this encounter are with Six-Knives at the head of the group—or, if he's dead, one of his protégés, now a [bandit captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)—hoping to plunder more coin from the characters' pockets or exacting revenge for their earlier losses.

## Reunion with the Rivals

![The spires of the Barbed F...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/critical-role-call-of-the-netherdeep/img/022-02-003-spires-barbed-fields.webp#center "The spires of the Barbed Fields reach as high as thirty feet into the sky")

This encounter takes place only if the characters are trailing behind the rivals and traveling at a fast pace to catch up with them. The time of day when this encounter occurs is up to you. In the morning or around midday, the rivals are traveling. In the evening, the rivals are making camp. In the middle of the night, [Galsariad Ardyth (tier 1)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/galsariad-ardyth-tier-1-crcotn.md) is on watch; see appendix A for his stat block.

This is an open-ended encounter that unfolds in a certain way depending on the characters' objective:

- **Jewel Theft..** If the characters intend to take the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-crcotn.md) from the rivals, this will likely be a combat encounter or an attempted infiltration.  
- **No Quarrel..** If the characters aren't looking to quarrel, this encounter is a roleplaying opportunity during which the characters can interact with the rivals.  

### Friendly or Indifferent Rivals

If the rivals are friendly or indifferent toward the characters, they welcome the characters' arrival. If the party catches up to the rivals in the daytime, the rivals agree to travel together for a while. If this encounter occurs at night, the rivals invite the characters into their camp.

To make roleplaying the rivals easier, have one or two of them take center stage during this encounter. Let them ask the questions, do most of the talking, and try to get what they want from the characters. The other rivals might be cooking food or engaged in some other minor activity in the background.

If you think a rival has a chance to achieve one of their goals (see the Rivals' Goals table in the introduction), this is an opportunity for them to try to achieve that goal. For example, Maggie, who wants to spar with a tactical genius, might invite a character to take a seat at her Dragonchess board and have a game. While they play, she makes conversation about battle tactics—how she prefers to gang up on foes and overwhelm them, rather than engaging in a fair fight, since, in her words, "People who fight fair don't win fights." Determine the winner of the game by having each participant make an Intelligence check at the end of the conversation, with victory going to whoever rolls the highest.

### Hostile Rivals

If the rivals are hostile, Ayo Jabe urges the characters to keep away. She doesn't want to fight but makes it clear that her group is prepared to defend themselves.

The characters can't sneak up on the rivals on the open road. If the rivals are camping, any character who tries to sneak into the camp must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid being detected by Galsariad. If Galsariad detects the intruders but is friendly or indifferent toward one or more of them, he is willing to quietly talk things out. If not, combat breaks out as he shouts to rouse his allies.

If the characters insist on fighting or are caught trying to steal from the rivals, the rivals attack.

## Emerald Loop Caravan Stop

At the intersection of the Emerald Loop and the Hallowed Path stands a forest known as the Wandering Oak's Grove. A clearing inside the forest is used by travelers as a rest stop. Read or paraphrase the following as the characters arrive:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large stand of trees rises out of the barren wasteland. The leaves of dozens of towering oaks rustle in the breeze, and the scent of a bonfire wafts from a trail of smoke rising from somewhere ahead. The path through the trees is deeply rutted by the work of countless wagon wheels. A wooden sign posted at the head of the path bears the decorated shepherd's crook that is the holy symbol of Melora the Wild Mother, and the words "Emerald Loop Caravan Stop."
^0d3

A character can make a DC 13 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check to see if they know anything about the caravan stop. On a success, they recall that this is a safe and respected way point that has existed for over 150 years. It's said that some of the best hunters in the wastes stop here to sell their catches—and that the best mastodon kor'rundl (see area L5) in the Kryn Dynasty is sold here.

Characters who succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check know that a treant named Wandering Oak first seeded this forest, and that she later entrusted it to a pair of dryads of the Wild Mother who call themselves the Acorn Sisters. They permit some logging but harshly punish anyone who takes more than they allow.

#### L1: Entrance to the Clearing

Read or paraphrase the following as the characters enter the caravan stop:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The forest pathway opens into a large clearing, nearly a hundred feet across. Music, laughter, and the savory aromas of fresh-cooked food and woodsmoke drift through the air. On the west side of the clearing stands a full-grown horizonback tortoise. On its back is the homestead of a family of goblins, who are making repairs to the structure. On the other side of the clearing, seven covered wagons encircle a bonfire, and a rope fence has been set up north of this encampment to contain the wagons' oxen.
^0d6

#### L2: Big Yuyo

Big Yuyo is an adult [horizonback tortoise](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/horizonback-tortoise-egw.md) (see appendix A)—known as a "kinespaji" in Goblin—that is the home of the Kruzkrenner goblin family. The tortoise is named after a Xhorhasian vegetable called a yuyo—an ochre cucumber that grows in Rosohna's underground gardens.

The platforms and structures on Big Yuyo's back are made of wood, thatch, canvas, and rope. They sometimes need maintenance, and the family is busy repairing their home. They're currently on a trip from Rosohna to Asarius to meet up with the bugbear side of their family.

##### Goblin Family

The Kruzkrenner family is made up of the following people. Some of them are working on repairs and spending time together on Big Yuyo's back, but some might be found elsewhere at the caravan stop:

**Papa Drazagorr** (lawful neutral, goblin [veteran](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) served in the Aurora Watch when he was younger and still has an appreciation for military discipline. These days, he doesn't wear armor or carry weapons, except for a dagger.

**Pops Kelbadurn** (neutral good, goblin [guard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) served in the Asarius Town Guard and still has his old chain mail, spear, and shield stored in the command post (area L2f). He's easygoing and artistic.

**Auntie Jaller** (chaotic neutral, hobgoblin [druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md)) is old and elegant-looking, thanks to her long silver hair and deep green robes. She calls herself an "old witch" and spends much of her time brewing potions and inventing new tea blends.

**Little Gothby** (lawful neutral, goblin noncombatant) is a dutiful 5-year-old. He doesn't talk to strangers but instead heads for one of his dads if he is approached.

**Little Chespa** (chaotic good, goblin noncombatant) is 3 years old. She can speak in full sentences, and can read and write as well as an adult. She likes to hop down off the tortoise and frolic through the clearing.

##### Big Yuyo Locations

Locations keyed to Big Yuyo are described below:

- **L2a Upladder..** This ladder leads up at the rear of Big Yuyo's shell to the platforms on the tortoise's back. Little Chespa yells, "Halt! Who goes there?" to anyone she doesn't know who tries to board Big Yuyo.  
- **L2b Rear Hut..** The rear platform supports a hut where Auntie Jaller and the two kids sleep. It's filled with homemade straw dolls and other toys.  
- **L2c Central Platform..** This central platform supports a 30-foot-tall watchtower.  
- **L2d Archery Tower..** This elevated platform is designed to give an archer a clear view of the surroundings.  
- **L2e Starboard Gazebo..** This platform holds a gazebo, where the family can relax.  
- **L2f.** Command Post. The command post holds Drazagorr and Kelbadurn's bed and their belongings, which include a set of goblin-sized [chain mail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chain-mail.md), a [spear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spear.md), a [shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md), two [shortbows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortbow.md), two [quivers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quiver.md) containing 20 [arrows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/arrows-20.md) apiece, and a wooden chest that holds 100 gp (the family's savings) and a collection of sentimental keepsakes.  

#### L3: Ox Corral

The seven oxen penned here are used to pull the covered wagons in area L5. They are usually docile, but a character who tries to spook them by making a sudden noise can make a DC 15 Charisma ([Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check, causing them to rampage around the corral and cause a bit of chaos on a successful check. The ruckus creates enough of a distraction to allow one or more characters to search a location without being seen by others in the caravan stop.

#### L4: Adventurers' Camp

The rivals camp here if they arrived at the caravan stop ahead of the characters. If the characters are traveling ahead of the rivals or with them, this campsite is being used by an Aurora Watch patrol instead.

Meeting the rivals here provides an opportunity for the characters to interact with them if the Rivals' Reunion encounter has not occurred.

#### L5: Bonfire

This bonfire is the center of activity at the caravan stop. Gaeya Iliera, a neutral good, drow [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) in a rugged outfit, is cooking some of the best mastodon kor'rundl to be found outside of Asarius. This savory dish is a hearty rice bowl topped with spicy grilled mastodon and smoky-flavored kor'run, a vegetable like a deep red squash grown in Rosohna's sunless gardens. A character who partakes of this food awakens the next morning with `1d10` "temporary hit points" that last for the next 24 hours.

Several other travelers are relaxing around the bonfire, playing games, sharing stories, and singing songs. Among those gathered here are the following individuals:

- Tyvak and Moghra (chaotic good, human [berserkers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md)) survived the battle with the udaak that the characters saw the aftermath of in the Demonic Carrion encounter. They are the daughter and son of Kierchaly Wastewalker and belong to the same clan as Irvan Wastewalker. If Tyvak sees that one of the characters has retrieved her father's [+1 dagger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) from that site, she offers to trade her [+1 battleaxe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) for it and thanks the characters with all her heart if the dagger is turned over.  
- Justice (lawful neutral, tiefling [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) and his [moorbounder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/moorbounder-egw.md) mount, Rice Pudding, are here if they survived the Moorbounder Mayhem encounter. If the characters helped him during that encounter, Justice gives them a pair of [goggles of night](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/goggles-of-night.md) that the caravan he's working for had a hard time selling at their last stop.  
- The Acorn Sisters, Lanata and Robur, are [dryads](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad.md). As the caretakers of this forest, they're fine with bonfires as long as only dead wood is burned. It's customary to share food, drink, and song with them in appreciation for their hospitality. Characters who show them great respect by making an offering directly to them awaken in the morning with a *charm of vitality* (see the rules for "supernatural gifts" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").  

##### Shopping

The caravanners parked around the bonfire—including Justice's employers, if he is present—have merchandise for sale. Two neutral [bugbear chiefs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear-chief.md) guard the wagons, and six lawful neutral Aurora Watch [veterans](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) (a mix of drow, humans, and orcs) resting at the camp are prepared to apprehend any thieves and drag them to Bazzoxan in chains.

The Merchants' Wares table lists the items available for sale and the number of each item that the merchants have in stock.

## Arrival at Bazzoxan

This chapter concludes as the characters reach the entrance to the fortress-town of Bazzoxan. As they approach the gate, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Jutting from the rusty orange mountains of eastern Xhorhas are tall spires of black stone. This is the Betrayers' Rise—a foul fortress from times long past. Beneath the spires, a vast gate blocks all entry to the military outpost of Bazzoxan, which sits in the shadows of the Betrayers' Rise. Crumbling and desolate structures huddle between iron watchtowers, and soldiers of the Aurora Watch patrol the tops of the walls and the massive gate ahead of you. As you approach, a guard on the wall barks, "Identify!"
^0df

If the characters are traveling with members of the Aurora Watch (perhaps the soldiers they met in the Aurora Watch Patrol encounter or at the caravan stop), the soldiers vouch for them, responding with, "Friends of the Dynasty!" No further words need be said, and the entire group is granted access as the gate is opened.

If the characters are traveling alone, they find that the guards of Bazzoxan are eager to let them in. Upon scanning their appearance, a guard asks, "Are you mercenaries? We could use your strength of arms." If the characters are interested or want to discuss terms, the guards say they'll bring the party to the Taskhand—the local authority of this settlement—to explain the details. The gate opens, and the characters pass through into the grim town of Bazzoxan.

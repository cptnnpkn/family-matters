Left: The Ancient towers of Bazzoxan look like only a god could have crafted them.

Below: Ruidium festers and grows if left unchecked, just like the Apotheon's anguish. Stronger than iron, it grows in gruesome organic patterns.

The leaders of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream operate in the shadows. They don't all feature in this adventure, but they could be villains in your ongoing campaign.

In his human form, Alyxian bears tokens of the three gods who blessed him: Avandra's brooch, Corellon's dagger, and Sehanine's shield.

Alyxian has two inhuman forms that make him strong but prevent anyone from healing his trauma. The first is a scarred monster with ancient weapons stuck in its hide (with a tiny figure of a human below to show scale).

The second is an angelic form incapable of compassion.

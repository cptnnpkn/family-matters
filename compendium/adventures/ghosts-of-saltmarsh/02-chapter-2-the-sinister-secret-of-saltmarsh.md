# Chapter 2: The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh, p. 37* 

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/009-02-01-chapter-2.webp#center)

Four miles east of Saltmarsh, just inland of the old coast road, stands a haunted house. Until twenty years ago, it had been the residence of an aged alchemist of sinister reputation. Even then, locals avoided the house because of its owner's mysterious activities. Now, two decades after the unexplained disappearance of its occupant, the house has taken on an even greater air of evil and mystery.

Dilapidated and long abandoned, the house presents an unwholesome appearance. Those hardy souls who have infrequently sought entry (pursuing rumors of a secret hoard of alchemical gold) all returned with naught save grim tales of decaying chambers presided over by monstrous perils. Indeed, such is the reputation of the house that the fields around it, though prime agricultural land, remain untended and rank with weeds.

This adventure is designed for four to six 1st-level characters. If the characters complete both portions, "The Haunted House" and "The Sea Ghost," they are likely to reach 3rd level.

> [!note] About the Original
> 
> Produced by the UK branch of TSR in 1981, *Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh* was designed by Dave J. Brown and Don Turnbull. It was a revelation at the time, marking the first appearance in a D&D adventure of a haunted house and a raid on a sailing ship. It also set the tone for TSR UK's subsequent output, which often featured strong, central narratives that challenged players to take a creative approach to problem solving. They usually included multiple, smaller locations to explore, lending a sense of variety to a single adventure.
^about-the-original

## Background

In recent times, there have been reports of fearsome hauntings, horrible shrieks, and eerie lights emanating from the dismal place. Now, not even the bravest of the area's denizens dare to approach the house, let alone enter it. If the characters seek anyone in Saltmarsh who has been in the place, they initially find no one. Persistent questioning of the town's inhabitants makes them frightened and apprehensive but does not yield any concrete information.

If the characters pursue their questioning, they might (at your discretion) find an aged poacher who, after suitable inducement (money, ale, or both), confesses to having wandered in the back door of the house a couple of years before, hoping to acquire some food. Encouraged by the prospect of free wine in the cellar, he started to descend the stairs, heard ghastly shrieks and piercing wails, and ran, frightened out of his wits. He knows where the back door is and also noticed a nearby well. He can vaguely describe the kitchen, the scullery, and the passage that leads to them from the back door, but he knows nothing else about the layout of the place.

Furthermore, his memory of what frightened him has become exaggerated over the months, so he is likely to tell the party that a horde of ghosts came up the stairs to the scullery, or maybe it was a vampire with a swarm of rats. He discovered soon after his escapade that the telling of his tale, in ever more lurid detail, was an easy means of obtaining free ale foisted on him by appreciative listeners. Recently, however, none have asked him to tell the tale, so once his tongue is loosened, he is eager to restore some of his lost prestige. Apart from alerting adventurers to sinister and grave dangers of his own invention and telling them a little about the layout of the house, he provides no accurate or useful information.

### The Secret

The secret of the haunted house is that it is not, in fact, haunted. It is the shore base for a band of smugglers led by a wizard named [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md). The eerie lights seen at night by onlookers are the smugglers' signals to a ship out at sea. The unearthly shrieks and other sounds are caused by [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) spells strategically placed in the building. The smugglers, during their three years of successful operation, have through these tactics frightened away all local attempts at investigating their hideout.

It is paramount that the characters are given no obvious clues that would lead them to believe the house is not haunted; they must deduce the truth for themselves or simply stumble upon it.

#### The Sea Ghost

A contingent of smugglers glides through the waters near Saltmarsh on their ship, the *Sea Ghost*. The ship is away from the house when the characters explore it, though evidence of its moorings can be discovered in the secret caverns below. The ship comes into play in the second part of this adventure.

#### Sanbalet's Gang

The smugglers are familiar with the house, caverns, and surrounding area, except for the secret lab at area 24. If they become aware of the characters' intrusion, they cooperate to locate and destroy the invaders.

The following members of the gang are currently in the house, skulking about in the cellar and the adjoining caverns: [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) (see appendix C), two [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), four [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md), and four [scouts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). All the bandits and scouts are humans of neutral evil alignment. Before being alerted to the characters' incursion the smugglers are dispersed in the cellar and caverns beneath the house (as indicated in the area descriptions).

##### Smugglers on Alert

In the likely event that the characters betray their presence (likely by triggering one of the [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) spells in areas 4 and 10), the smugglers become aware of the party before encountering them. [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) and three of his gang (a [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), a [bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md), and a [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) immediately retreat to areas 27 and 28 to protect the smuggled goods.

The others break into two groups. Two [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) and a [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) wait in area 21 to ambush intruders. The second hobgoblin keeps watch at area 30, but runs to reinforce [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) in area 27 if a fight breaks out there. The remaining members of the gang, two scouts and a bandit, try to ambush intruders. They make Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to close in on the party. If two of them are slain, the survivor tries to flee back to area 21.

### Portents of War

[Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) and his smugglers have little interest in the larger goings-on of the region. They most highly value gold, drink, and the freedom that comes with pursuing a life of crime. They have no concern for the implications of their actions, which could be a precursor to war.

The smugglers currently run weapons for a clan of lizardfolk living near Saltmarsh whose queen, [Othokent](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/othokent-gos.md), is preparing her clan for battle against a terrible enemy: the sahuagin.

The peaceful town of Saltmarsh knows nothing of the coming war, or the fact that a sahuagin invasion threatens them as much as the lizardfolk do.

## Adventure Summary

The adventure is divided into two parts, "The Haunted House" and "The Sea Ghost."

"The Haunted House" likely plays out in the following sequence.

The characters arrive in the town of Saltmarsh and begin to hear tales of the haunted house, after which they might seek more information about the house and its current state. If you decide so, they can speak to the poacher mentioned in the "Background" section.

The characters set out to explore the house, where they meet its crawling and hissing residents. Awaiting them is Ned, a deceptive NPC who tries to prevent the characters from uncovering the smuggling operation. Whether the characters discover the smugglers or the smugglers initiate an attack on the party, a confrontation with the gang is inevitable, especially if the characters are thorough in their exploration. Ned reveals his true colors at an opportune moment.

The caverns and contraband below the house wait to be discovered. Access to the sea suggests the use of a large ship, though such a vessel is not to be found. The first part of the adventure concludes when the characters return to Saltmarsh with the truth and are rewarded for their work.

The town elders offer to hire the party to board and commandeer the smugglers' ship when it returns to its secret port. That event sets in motion "The Sea Ghost," which likely unfolds in the following sequence.

The characters discover a document that explains the signaling system used by the smugglers to indicate the ship has arrived; by deciphering and sending the proper return signal, they can put the crew at ease. By force or deception, the party boards the *Sea Ghost* and attempts to seize control. During this raid, the party encounters a captured sea elf named [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) and a trio of lizardfolk warriors. The adventure concludes with signs that the lizardfolk are preparing for a raid, presumably on the town of Saltmarshâ€”though the truth, as outlined in the "Portents of War" section, is far more ominous.

> [!note] Placing the Adventure
> 
> The town of Saltmarsh is a small, respectable fishing town located in the Greyhawk campaign setting, in the southernmost part of Keoland. It is situated some twenty miles from two larger towns: Burle, to the northwest, and Seaton, along the coast to the east.
> 
> Here are suggestions for where you can place this adventure in other campaign settings.
> 
> **Eberron.** Even to the pioneering folk of Q'barra, Saltmarsh is a frontier town. The lean-tos and shanties sprawl in the steaming eastern deltas of the Basura Swamp, and their inhabitants do their best to keep out of the affairs of the lizardfolk in the interior. An elf illusionist bearing the Mark of House Phiarlan leads the smugglers and seems bent on stirring up trouble.
> 
> **Forgotten Realms.** Midway between Waterdeep and Neverwinter, the town of Saltmarsh and its hardy inhabitants endure both winter storms and the Mere of Dead Men to the south. Because of the politics churning in Thornhold on the far side of the marsh, help is often slow to come, and so the townsfolk have become quite self-reliant. The smugglers could be from Luskan, and their selling weapons to lizardfolk could be connected to deeper goals than simply lining their pockets.
> 
> **Mystara.** Saltmarsh stands on the border between the Grand Duchy of Karameikos and the Five Shires, just inside the edge of the Blight Marsh. The smugglers who use the haunted house as their base might be Hin pirates, or at the very least count some halflings among the crew, keen to avoid the authorities at Rollstone Keep up the coast.
^placing-the-adventure

### A Man on the Inside

A merchant in Saltmarsh who profits from the illegal activities of [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) has taken desperate action to ensure that the smuggling operation continues. The merchant sent a local thug, Ned Shakeshaft, to the house to await the characters in a remote bedroom on the first floor.

Ned pretends to have been knocked out, gagged, bound, and left to die by unseen attackers. After being "rescued" by the characters, he aims to sow dissent, cause accidents, and otherwise make trouble as they explore the house.

More information on Ned and how to incorporate him into the adventure can be found in area 15.

## Adventure Hooks

For two decades, the haunted house near Saltmarsh has sat, its ill reputation festering. Characters who have backgrounds related to Saltmarsh have heard of the house. Use any of the following hooks to capture the attention of the players.

### Hidden Hoard

For years, the tales of the haunted house near Saltmarsh have circulated through the region. Though most of the stories are rightfully taken as warnings to avoid the place, rumors persist of a great treasure hidden in its walls. What relics and other valuables did that old alchemist keep in the creaking floorboards and cracked plaster walls of his home?

### Knowledge Unlimited

The alchemist lived a hermit's life, with few visitors and fewer friends. But a young messenger once emerged from the house with a story of a grand library containing countless tomes. Retellings of the messenger's tale have varied over the years, with the most popular versions suggesting that the alchemist had discovered a method of transforming base metals into gold.

### It Must Be Cleansed

It cannot stand! An unholy place so close to civilization. These accounts of wailing and flashing lights disturb the mind and heart. Let any abandoned edifice rot in obscurity so long as the dead leave it alone. But how can one let stand a harbor for evil? The house must be cleansed of its otherworldly occupants.

## The Haunted House

After gleaning what "facts" they can from the townsfolk and equipping themselves at the local shops, the characters set out to explore the fabled haunted house.

### Traveling to the House

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The road to the house winds through the rocky coastal terrain, often offering a view of the sea below. Low clouds press upon you; occasional patches of sunlight appear out over the water. A stiff wind blows in off the waves, carrying the briny stink of churning salt water.
^0c8

The house is located four miles up the coast from Saltmarsh and is accessible by an old road. Curious townsfolk might follow the party for part of their journey. These escorts engage the characters in conversation, ask about their intentions, and repeat the same rumors and stories heard in town. As soon as the house comes into view, the townsfolk grow grim-faced and retreat toward Saltmarsh.

### House Exterior

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The decrepit house sits on the highest ground in the area. Around it, a stone wall has crumbled in many places, exposing the interior grounds. An ornate metal gate lies open at the end of the road, swaying slightly in the wind. Wild flora grows throughout the inner yard, but all the years cannot hide the evidence of a well-tended garden that once sat here. Near the house, the rotted wooden roof of a water well rises out of the tall grass.
^0ca

The house is 35 feet tall from ground level to roof peak; the roof is gabled and has several holes where the slate shingles are missing.

#### The Wall

The stone wall is 6 feet tall and more or less encloses the garden. It has partially collapsed in several places, so access to any part of the garden is simple even if characters decide not to enter through the main gate.

#### The Garden

The alchemist kept a vegetable garden around the house, which was used as a retreat from the stress of work and as a supply of fresh food. Now, a few broken gardening tools and a tangle of weeds are all that remain. A single rosebush near the gate has overgrown the wall and choked out most of the other plants. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check discovers that something large has made a burrow under the rosebush.

A family of four [giant weasels](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-weasel.md) resides in the thorny mass, having dug out a home under the wall. The weasels are highly aggressive and try to ambush the characters as they investigate the garden. Given the opportunity, they'll try to grapple the smallest character and drag them toward their den.

#### The Well

A character who makes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check while viewing the well from a distance notices a cluster of small mammal remains in the tall grass around the well (primarily mice, squirrels, and the like).

The well shaft, which descends 20 feet, still contains clean water. Fed by an aquifer; the well offers no access to the house nor the caverns below it. If the characters illuminate the shaft while looking down, they see the glint of coins through the shallow water at the bottom. A Medium or smaller creature can climb down the well, using the rocky walls as natural handholds.

Two [giant poisonous snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-poisonous-snake.md) make their homes in the crumbled and crevice-ridden walls of the well shaft. They emerge and strike at anything that descends into the well. They also emerge if the characters linger near the well while investigating it.

##### Treasure

There are 14 sp to be had at the bottom of the well.

### House Interior

The house's interior is dilapidated and damp, with patches of harmless mold everywhere. The woodwork is generally rotten, cobwebs and dust are thick, and rubbish is scattered everywhere. Plaster fallen from the walls and ceiling lies strewn across the floor, along with the shattered remains of vandalized furniture. Fireplaces (with chimneys too narrow to climb) show no signs of recent use.

All house corridors are 5 feet wide and 10 feet high; all ceilings are 10 feet high except for the attic level where, because of the sloping roof, the height ranges from l foot at the sides to 15 feet in the center.

All doors are 5 feet wide and 7 feet high, of normal wood construction; all are closed but unlocked (with the exception of area 15) and easy to open. Most of the window panes are broken, and all are easy to open.

Unless otherwise noted, illumination is bright during the day on the ground floor and the floor above it. In the attic, due to various holes in the roof, the light is dim but adequate, leaving plenty of dark shadows in corners.

### Ground Floor

The following locations are identified on map 2.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2.1: Haunted House](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/011-06-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/012-06-pc.webp#gallery)

#### 1. Entrance Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The front door opens onto a musty, dirty entrance hall. To your left, a corridor leads into the west wing of the house. The walls are bare and bits of smashed furniture lie upon the floor. Ahead of you, another corridor leads toward the rear of the house.
> 
> A staircase on the eastern wall climbs to the next story, reaching it at a balcony that overlooks the entrance hall along its north and west sides; the stairs appear safe to climb, though the balcony rail is broken in several places. Under the stairs at the north end of the hall, a third corridor leads east.
^0d2

The stairs show considerable wear and creak ominously when tread upon but remain strong enough to support anyone climbing to the second floor.

A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check finds two sets of recently made humanoid tracks. One set of tracks travels from the entryway toward area 9. The second leads away from the foot of the stairs and along the western corridor toward area 4.

##### Balcony

About 10 feet west of the top of the stairs, a section of the balcony (the shaded area on the map) collapses under the weight of any creature attempting to cross it. The creature that causes the floor to collapse must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet to the floor below. The collapsed section of the balcony leaves a 7-foot-wide gap that must be crossed to reach the rest of the first floor.

#### 2. Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room was once a library, with bookshelves around the walls. Most of the shelves are broken, and in many places they have come away from the wall. The few shelves still intact are empty, but a pile of books rests in the southwest corner.
^0d5

The fourteen books in the heap untidily thrown into the corner are covered with cobwebs, vermin droppings, and harmless mold. All are partially ruined but are still legible. Most of the books are dull (histories, collections of romantic poems, and so forth), but three are quite noteworthy. These three books bear clear titles on their spines:

*The Magical Properties of Gemstones* by the archmage Tenser

*The Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers* by the archmage Tenser

*The Metaphysics of Mathematics* by the mage Nystul

Inside the third volume lies a piece of parchment torn from a larger sheet, containing a few lines of handwritten text in the Common tongue. Dampness has spoiled it so that only two words are legible: "beyond skeletons."

The books can be sold for 7 gp each, though finding a buyer for such tomes might require the party to look beyond Saltmarsh.

#### 3. Study

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room was once a writing room or study. Against the wall under the windows sits a large wooden writing desk, partially broken and riddled with damp rot. There are three drawers in each side of the desk and a large central drawer; the latter is closed, but the others are all openâ€”and two of them have been broken open forcibly.
^0d7

The central drawer is locked and can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The drawer contains nothing but old, valueless documents, all written in Commonâ€”receipts for purchases of various chemicals and laboratory equipment. A character who makes a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check uncovers a small secret compartment.

##### Treasure

Inside the secret compartment, wrapped in cloth, is a glass vial containing two doses of [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md).

#### 4. Living Area

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A door in the north wall leads onto a small patio, the paving cracked and overrun with weeds. Other than a pile of refuse in the southeast corner, the room is bare.
^0da

A secret trapdoor in the northern half of the room leads to the cellar (area 21). One of the sets of tracks found in area 1 leads to the trapdoor; if the characters are following those tracks, the trapdoor is immediately noticeable (because the tracks go right up to it). If the characters didn't notice the tracks in area 1, allow them a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to pick up the trail in this room. If all else fails, the trapdoor can be spotted by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

##### Magic Mouth

[Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) has cast a [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) spell on the trapdoor. When a creature comes within 5 feet of it, the spell is triggered, causing the following message to be spoken in a loud and malevolent voice: "Welcome, foolsâ€”welcome to your deaths!" Booming, fiendish laughter follows the spoken message.

Each creature that hears the message must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on all ability checks for 1 hour unless it is immune to the [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition. The creature can repeat the saving throw every 15 minutes.

##### Development

At your discretion, the smuggler in the cellar below the trapdoor might notice the [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) being triggered. In this case, the smugglers become aware of the characters and investigate or prepare themselves for the intruders; see "The Smugglers" above.

#### 5. Living Area

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The only thing of note in the room is a clump of tiny red mushrooms growing around a fireplace in a semicircular formation. Otherwise, the room is bare.
^0de

The mushrooms are harmless.

##### Treasure

A character who searches the chimney of the fireplace discovers a loose stone about 3 feet above the top of the fireplace that conceals a small cavity. Inside the cavity is a small leather pouch containing two cut pieces of blue quartz (10 gp each).

#### 6. Living Area

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Aside from a large amount of plaster that has fallen from the ceiling, this room is bare.
^0e1

The floor in the room above (see area 14) is considerably weaker than elsewhere, a fact visible to any who look up and make a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. There is nothing else of note here.

#### 7. Dining Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At one time a long table stood in the center of this room; now it lies broken on the floor. A broken chair sits against the wall between the windows, and there is a heap of broken dishes in the northwest corner.
^0e3

There is nothing else of note here.

#### 8. Withdrawing Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two stuffed armchairs stand near the fireplace of this room. The covers of both have been torn and the stuffing has been pulled out, but the wooden frames are intact. A broken table lies on the floor near the north wall.
^0e5

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds a stone out of place on the chimney above the fireplace. Removing the stone reveals a hidden compartment. Additionally, characters who approach the fireplace notice a collection of mouse bones spilling out from the hearth.

A [swarm of insects (spiders)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-spiders.md) lurks in the crevices of the fireplace and chimney. The spiders flood forth with obvious irritation if any creatures move to within 5 feet of the fireplace.

##### Treasure

The hidden compartment contains a wooden box. Inside the box are 30 cp and two small pouches of alchemical powders (5 gp each).

#### 9. Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This kitchen is dirty and damp, with patches of gray mold and cobwebs on the floor, walls, and ceiling. In the southwest corner is some iron cooking equipment with a chimney above. Next to it, under the window, is a cracked and discolored stone sink.
> 
> To the right of the sink, a small, closed wooden cupboard is fixed to the wall about five feet above floor level.
> 
> Against the far wall, a flight of wooden stairs leads upward from west to east; the woodwork of the staircase is decayed, and a few of the treads are missing.
^0e8

The cupboard is empty. The stairs lead to area 18; they are in poor condition but still usable.

If the characters found the tracks in area 1 that lead here, they discover that the tracks continue into area 10. If they failed to find the tracks earlier, they can pick up the trail here with a successful DC 10 Intelligence [Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.

Four [giant centipedes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-centipede.md) nest under the floor below the sink. They come and go through a hole in the foundation beneath the kitchen. The centipedes skitter up the drain, enter the room, and attack anyone investigating the cupboard or the sink.

#### 10. Scullery

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room displays the effects of damp and decay more than most. Mold grows in patches on the floor, walls, and ceiling. A large copper cask, split, discolored and empty, stands under the window, with a small heap of crockery shards on the floor beside it. Stairs lead down into what is presumably a cellar.
^0ea

Anyone who inspects the cask can tell from the staining on its interior that it was used to boil water.

If the characters found the tracks in area 9 that lead here, they discover that they descend the stairs into area 20 below. If they failed to find the tracks earlier, they can pick up the trail here with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.

##### Magic Mouth

[Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) has cast a [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) spell on the stairs, which is triggered when anyone treads on the top step. If the spell is set off, hideous screamsâ€”as if of a soul in tormentâ€”rise from the cellar below.

Each creature that hears the screams must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on all ability checks for 1 hour unless it is immune to the [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition. The creature can repeat the saving throw every 15 minutes.

### Upper Floor

The following locations are identified on map 2.1. Review the information regarding the balcony in area 1 before the characters ascend to this floor.

#### 11. Moldering Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> What was once a fine master bedroom now stands decayed. Some of the floorboards are missing, and there is rubbish scattered around. A tall wooden wardrobe stands against the wall opposite the fireplace, its door closed.
^0ee

The wardrobe contains two items: a pair of old, cracked leather boots with no value or special properties, and a ragged, stained cloak hanging on a peg. The cloak is tooled with a design of coiling ivy leaves and appears harmless but the inner folds are covered in [yellow mold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/yellow-mold.md) (see ""Dungeon Hazards"" in chapter 5 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

#### 12. Decrepit Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rubbish is scattered around what was once a fine guest bedroom; there is evidence of rodent infestation, and webs hang in the corners. A four-poster bed stands against the wall opposite the fireplace. Its woodwork is worm-ridden, and the curtains that once screened the bed are torn and stained. There is no bed linen, but the bed is mostly intact.
^0f0

While some smugglers have slipped away to nap here in recent months, there is nothing of particular note here.

#### 13. Guest Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This bedroom has no furniture, but rubbish is scattered everywhere, and webs cover the walls and ceiling. From the doorway, you can see a glint of light in the fireplace from a small, highly reflective object.
^0f2

Two [swarms of insects (spiders)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-spiders.md) infest this room. One swarm descends on anyone who approaches the fireplace, and the other descends from the webs above the door a moment later. Both wash down the walls with the muffled clatter of thousands of tiny legs.

##### Fireplace

The glint inside the fireplace comes from a small crystal bauble (5 sp) that once belonged to the alchemist. The flat-bottomed crystal orb is pleasant to look at and tactilely satisfying to hold, but ultimately neither particularly valuable nor useful. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check while examining the bauble realizes it might be a part of a set of similar crystals used as counterweights in alchemical work.

#### 14. Crumbling Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room appears to be another dirty, decaying bedroom without furniture. Even viewed from the doorway, it's evident that the floor in here does not look safe; some of the floorboards are missing, and others are partially dislodged.
^0f5

Anyone who enters the room with reasonable care can avoid moving into the part of the floor that is sagging and damaged, looking perhaps not strong enough to support significant weight. A successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check enables a character to detect recent tracks that lead from the door to the window, and back again, along the west edge of the room.

##### Clues at the Window

A combination of the position of the house and the topography of the cliff results in this room providing the best view of the sea from any part of the house, and it is from here that the smugglers signal to their colleagues out at sea. A character who carefully examines the window area and makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers small clues to this fact: fresh scratches on the sill where the signaling lantern has been placed, scuffing of the floor dust immediately near the window, and so forth. These signs cannot be seen from the door; they require up-close observation to be discovered.

##### Falling Through the Floor

The tracks left on the floor by the smugglers represent the only safe places to walk in the room. Each time a Medium or larger creature moves off this safe trail into the shaded area on the map, it must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet through the floor, landing in area 6.

#### 15. Ned's Bedroom

The door to this room is locked. The key to the room has been left rather obviously in the hallway outside the room and can be spotted by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Alternatively, the door can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Any character who opens the lock discovers that it was recently oiled.

Once the door is opened, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the southeast corner of this decayed bedroom lies a man; he is alive, though bound and gagged. He is clad only in undergarments and appears to have no weapons or equipment.
^0f9

As with area 14, anyone who enters the room with reasonable care can avoid moving into the part of the floor that is sagging and damaged, looking perhaps not strong enough to support significant weight.

##### Falling Through the Floor

Each time a Medium or larger creature moves into the shaded area on the map, it must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet through the floor, landing in area 6.

##### Ned, Bound and Gagged

The man on the floor is Ned Shakeshaft ([spy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) (see "A Man on the Inside" in the Adventure Summary and the "Snake in the Grass" sidebar), who does a convincing job of wanting to be rescued. He has a pretty good idea where his clothes are, and will ask to be escorted to area 17 to retrieve them. Ned has no other possessions, except for a single dose of [basic poison](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/basic-poison-vial.md) (see "chapter 5" of the "Player's Handbook") that he has concealed in the waistband of his undergarments. He can apply it to any slashing or piercing weapon as a bonus action.

> [!note] Snake in the Grass
> 
> Ned tells the characters he is a traveler from Seaton who entered the house the previous night to find a place to sleep during his journey to Saltmarsh where he hoped to find work as an adventurer. He entered through the back door and had only reached the kitchen when he was attacked from behind and knocked [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). He awoke some hours agoâ€”bound, gagged, and stripped of his possessionsâ€”in this room. He did not see his attackers nor has he heard any sounds in the house. Now he would like to be released and to join the characters in their mission.
> 
> Neither Ned nor his merchant mentor are fools, and they have given some thought to preparing this storyâ€”it is not possible for the characters to discern Ned's true motives. Indeed, to add verisimilitude to the story, Ned has a lump on the back of his head (inflicted, with sadistic delight, by the merchant before Ned left his company).
> 
> **What Ned Wants.** Ned wants to manipulate the characters into abandoning their mission. He tries to achieve this by playing up the dangers of the place and causing accidents as they explore. The closer the characters get to discovering the truth about the smugglers, the more desperate he becomes. When it became clear he can't warn the characters off, he'll try to ambush them with a poisoned weapon during a fight against other creatures.
^snake-in-the-grass

#### 16. Alchemist's Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Damp mold covers portions of the walls and ceiling in this large bedroom, and rubbish is strewn liberally around the floor. In the center is a single mattress that has been badly torn, from which stuffing protrudes. Under the window sits a large wooden chest, the timbers split and its lid closed.
^0ff

The chest is not locked and opens easily. Inside is a pile of moldy, ragged clothing in styles that were never in fashionâ€”nothing of valueâ€”and a bundle of documents. These pages are rotted and stained, their meaning lost long ago.

#### 17. Box Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room appears to have been used for storage. A large, ill-made oak chest stands under the window, its lid closed. Elsewhere in the room lie three broken wooden chairs, two splintered wooden buckets, and a mildewed sack. Just inside the door is a heap of clothing; these garments have collected little dust, appearing to have been placed here only recently.
^101

The chest is empty and the sack contains drab, rotted clothingâ€”laundry soiled long ago by the house's former owner. Those who untangle the balled contents find an inordinate number of wool socks.

The clothes on the floor belong to Ned Shakeshaft, the occupant of area 15.

#### 18. Landing

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Along the north wall of this area, a staircase descends to the ground floor of the rear of the house. The treads appear to be loose and perilous.
> 
> Another staircase along the east wall climbs to the upper level. This stair has mostly collapsedâ€”only the lowest six steps are still intact, and there is no easy access to the hole in the ceiling to where the staircase used to lead. A heap of rotten timber lies in the northeast corner.
^103

The stairs into the attic are not usable, and the characters must find another way to ascend into the topmost level of the house.

#### 19. Attic

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A gaping hole in the floor shows where the top of the staircase used to lead before it collapsed. There are grimy cobwebs on the walls and ceiling, and the floor is covered with broken furniture and other rubbish.
> 
> Several holes in the roof allow dim light to enter this large room that extends the length of the house. Two large sacks lie heaped in the northwest corner.
^105

The sacks contain old clothing and rags.

A group of six [stirges](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) nests in the rafters of the attic. They descend on the party at an opportune moment, revealing themselves after the characters enter the attic.

##### Treasure

A character who sifts through the rubbish discovers a porcelain doll costumed to look like a sailor. The doll's eyes are made from two pieces of jade worth 10 gp each.

### The Cellar

The following locations are identified on map 2.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2.2: Haunted House Cellar and Caverns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/013-04-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/014-04-pc.webp#gallery)

#### 20. Wine Cellar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shoulder-height wooden bottle racks line the north and west walls here. There appear to be no intact bottles left in the racks and shattered bottles cover the floor.
> 
> Against the east wall, at the foot of the stairs, rest two large metal storage bins that appear to be empty.
> 
> In the center of the room lies a human corpse clad in plate mail; a longsword lies by the corpse's right side, and a large shield covers its legs.
^109

If the characters are following the tracks that lead from area 1, through area 10, and down the stairs into this room, they discover that the tracks continue to the south wall of this chamber and stop abruptly at the secret door. If they failed to find the tracks earlier, they can pick up the trail here with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.

The secret door can be discovered by someone who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. This check is made with advantage if the characters followed the tracks that lead to the door.

##### Bottle Racks

The smugglers emptied the wine cellar a long time ago, though one full bottle remains, having rolled under a rack after it was jostled loose. Someone who examines the floor around the racks and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check can spot the bottle, its label bearing the image of a jauntily dressed unicorn. The contents are drinkable, and a character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check ascertains that it is a rare vintage worth 50 gp to the proper buyer. Anyone who samples the wine, though, finds it cloyingly sweet, the vintage's value clearly owing more to rarity than actual quality.

##### Corpse

The remains are those of an adventurer who set out to explore the house several weeks ago. The smugglers slew the heavily armored intruder and left the remains in place to scare off other visitors.

The corpse is infested with two [swarms of rot grubs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rot-grubs-mpmm.md) (see appendix C). Any creature that touches the body comes under attack by the swarms as they spill out of gaps in the armor. At a glance, the grubs' appearance looks unnervingly similar to curdled milk being squeezed from a bladder.

##### Treasure

The [plate mail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/plate-armor.md) is banged upâ€”the result of brutal clubbing and kickingâ€”but serviceable and fits a Medium creature. The [longsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md) and the [shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md) are in good condition. An [explorer's pack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/explorers-pack.md), lacking the rations and water, is under the corpse.

##### Development

The smuggler in area 21 is likely to hear the characters if they engage in combat in this area or are otherwise noisy. Unless the characters are purposefully quiet and stealthy, the single smuggler beyond the northern secret door hears them and retreats through the southern secret door, which connects area 21 with the caverns.

#### 21. Cellar

If the party makes a lot of noise while exploring area 20, the smuggler here has already vanished through the secret door.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This torchlit chamber was once a large cellar, but it has since been converted into living quarters. Ten crude beds stand along the south wall, each with a wooden locker at its foot.
> 
> A long wooden trestle table ringed by rickety stools dominates the center of the room. Metal cutlery, cups, and dirty plates sit atop the table.
> 
> A cookstove is installed near the table, and evidence of recently cooked meals sits in pots atop it. A large ham hangs from a loop of twine near the stove.
> 
> A sturdy set of stairs leads to a trapdoor in the ceiling above. There are two wooden doors in the east side of the room.
^10f

If the characters avoided making undue noise in area 20, a single smuggler ([bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) is scrubbing pots in a washbasin near the stove. He tries to flee through the secret door as soon as the characters appear. Otherwise, if the smugglers have been alerted to the party's presence, two [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) and a [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) are here and ready to fight.

Without a smuggler to point the way, someone must make a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find the secret door. The door is hidden behind some shelves that slide away to reveal the opening, which leads to the caverns.

When the party approaches the doors in the east end of the room, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door to your left appears normal, but the one ahead has a wooden bar across it, held in brackets on the frame and the door itself. The word "DANGER" is scrawled on that door in the Common tongue using chalk.
^110

The left door, leading to area 22, is unlocked.

##### Barred Door

Characters who examine the bar can see that it is damaged and bent, as if something has tried to push the door open from the other side.

##### Treasure

The ten wooden footlockers are locked. One can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A locker can also be pried open by a character who uses a crowbar and makes a successful DC 12 Strength check. The lockers contain personal effects; each also has a coin purse that holds 7 gp and 15 sp.

#### 22. Sanbalet's Private Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Unlike the barracks, this small room holds comfortable furnishings and appears to be well cared for.
> 
> A comfortable-looking bed in the northwest corner has a wooden locker at its foot.
> 
> A small wooden table stands against the east wall, with a padded leather chair beside it. On the table, a brass three-branch candlestick with three burning candles provides the room with bright light. The candles, though not fresh, are far from spent.
> 
> Under the table is a small wooden box and an unlit bullseye lantern with a movable shutter over the lens.
> 
> On a shelf above the table sit three books. In the northeast corner is a closed wooden wardrobe.
^114

If the characters have avoided alerting the smugglers to their presence, [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) (see appendix C) is in his quarters. Otherwise, this room is vacant.

[Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md)'s books consists of the following volumes:

- A volume of erotic poetry, fully illustrated  
- A naval almanac listing tide times for the area of coast around Saltmarsh (a total of one hundred miles of coastline is covered)  
- A treatise concerning the demigod Iuz and its minions  

Inside the third book is a sheet of parchment featuring a few simple words and phrases in the Common tongue and their equivalents in Goblin. The words include "stop," "fight," "lift," "come," and so forthâ€”key words used by [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) to instruct his hobgoblin mercenaries.

##### Bullseye Lantern

The [lantern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bullseye-lantern.md) is used to signal the *Sea Ghost*. Someone who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check realizes that the lantern is used only infrequently.

##### Treasure

The three books are worth 10 gp each. A fancy floor-length oilskin coat (5 gp) hangs in the wardrobe. Its sleeves contain numerous pockets (empty), and it is trimmed in iridescent green silk.

A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a hidden compartment under the table that holds [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md)'s spellbook. The book contains all the spells [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) has prepared.

The small wooden box holds twelve candles, flint and steel, and a piece of parchment that details [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md)'s method of communicating with the ship. See "The Signaling System" in the second part of this adventure for more information.

> [!note] The Cursed Luckstone
> 
> Do nothing to prevent the characters from being misled regarding the stone carried by the alchemist in area 23, as well as the book and the golden objects found in his lab in area 24.
> 
> In truth, there is no such thing as a philosopher's stone, although the characters might put two and two together and decide otherwise if they claim the stone from the alchemist, see the unlikely golden objects, and also decipher the book.
> 
> They might become excited at the idea of possessing an actual philosopher's stone! Of course, once a character attunes to the stone, the sad truth is revealed.
^the-cursed-luckstone

#### 23. Skeletons' Room

The bar securing the door is easily lifted. The smugglers sealed this room after discovering the undead within.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Light spilling in from the large room behind you barely shows that the chamber is only about twelve feet across and the corners are filled with shadow. What little you can see is dingy and dirty.
^119

Six old [skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) lurk in the shadows here. They rise and attack as soon as the characters enter the room. They have disadvantage on initiative checks owing to the length of their dormancy. The skeletons are reinforced by compounds applied to their bones years ago. The first time they take damage from a melee attack, that damage is reduced by half. If the skeletons are vulnerable to that damage, they instead ignore that vulnerability for this attack.

##### Development

If the characters spend more than a few moments here, a faint blue light appears at the seam of the secret door to area 24. The light gradually grows brighter as the alchemist's remains reanimate after long decades. At a time of your choosing, the alchemist ([skeletal alchemist](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeletal-alchemist-gos.md); see appendix C) emerges through the secret door to assist the skeletons.

When the alchemist enters the scene, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A hunched corpse wearing a pointed hat and dressed in a robe embroidered with mystic symbols crosses through the hidden door. Thin wisps of beard float from its bony jaw. It raises a finger, tracing arcane symbols in the air. In a hoarse voice, it speaks: "Secrets found and lost then found again. Your paltry minds cannot fathom..."
^11b

##### Treasure

The alchemist wears an empty [bag of holding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) at the waist. One rib bone on each of the skeletons is dipped in gold and is worth 5 gp. The alchemist also carries a [cursed luckstone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cursed-luckstone-gos.md) (see appendix B).

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/015-02-04-skeletal-alchemist.webp#center)

#### 24. Laboratory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The secret door opens toward you to reveal a clutter of broken glass and earthenware piled on the floor beyond. Three small copper pots lie amid the debris.
^11e

As the party enters and sees the rest of the room, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A bench runs down the west wall of what seems to be a laboratory. On the bench are jars of powders and liquids and several pieces of chemical apparatus.
> 
> There is a table against the south wall, forming an L-shape with the bench. A book is open on the table.
> 
> Also on the table is a candlestick, with a tiny stump of unlit candle still in it, and a variety of other items that, even in the dim light, shine with the warmth of pure gold. One of these objects looks like a human skull.
^11f

##### Book

Before the alchemist died, he was reading the book that lies open on the table. Its title is *Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher's Stone*, no author acknowledged. The book is worth 50 gp to the right buyer.

Though it is written in Common, the book is too profound and recondite a work to be fully understood by anyone other than the appropriate specialist, but a character might be able to deduce the general subject matter. Gaining that knowledge requires 8 hours of study and a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. The book contains instructions for the creation of a "philosopher's stone," then describes how that object can be used to convert base metal into gold.

##### Golden Objects

The objects on the table are made of pure goldâ€”but were manufactured this way, not magically transformed. Although the characters might infer that they are the results of successful experiments with the philosopher's stone, the truth is that the alchemist had them crafted to deceive a potential buyer into believing that the stone was real. The collection includes the following items:

- A human skull (20 gp)  
- An apple (5 gp)  
- A rose (5 gp)  
- A set of five small discs (balance weights, 5 gp each)  

##### Treasure

The table holds small stacks of gold coins totaling 47 gp. Examining the table closely reveals a concealed drawer that contains the spellbook the alchemist used when he was alive. The book's contents include [dancing lights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md), [comprehend languages](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md), [Tenser's floating disk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tensers-floating-disk.md), and [shatter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shatter.md). The chemical apparatus on the bench is worth 20 gp.

### The Caverns

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/016-02-06.webp#center)

The passages and caverns beyond the secret door in the south wall of room 21 all decline perceptibly toward the sea. The passage that runs north of areas 25 and 26 and the interior of areas 27, 28, and 29 are well-lit by torches set in crude brackets on the walls. Areas 25 and 26 are dark. Area 30 is open to daylight. The walls are slimy and the floors are moist, though the smugglers have laid matting in places to make them more easily passable.

All these passages and caverns are natural, though there are signs of worked stone here and there; such evidence is found on the stairs leading from the secret door and in places where narrow passages were widened.

It is likely that the characters have dealt with members of [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md)'s gang before entering the caverns. The following area descriptions assume that the smugglers have responded (see "Smugglers on Alert" in the "Background" section), so that [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) and a few of the smugglers await the characters in area 27 and 28.

If the smugglers are caught off guard, most of them are scattered throughout the caverns. Be sure to place them in a way that does not overwhelm the characters, but once combat begins in the caverns, it likely won't stop until the gang is entirely dealt with. If [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) is slain, consider having any remaining smugglers flee.

The following locations are identified on map 2.2.

#### 25. Slimy Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This uneven, naturally formed cavern is about twenty feet in diameter.
^125

Two patches of [green slime](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/green-slime.md) (see ""Dungeon Hazards"" in chapter 5 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide") hang at a point on the ceiling roughly halfway between the two passage mouths. They drop on characters (or smugglers) who pass below, landing with a distinctively soggy slap.

#### 26. Natural Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This roughly circular, naturally formed cavern is about twenty-five feet in diameter.
^127

If the smugglers are not yet aware of the characters' presence, three [scouts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) are resting here while they await instructions. There is nothing else of note in this area.

#### 27. Storage Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cavern, like the passage leading to it, is well lit by torches held in simple iron brackets around the walls. You can see five small bolts of cloth stacked against the wall to your left, and to your right are eight small casks in a neat row.
^129

This is the primary storage chamber for [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md)'s smuggling operation, and the likely place from which he and his gang mount a defense.

If an alarm has not been raised, two [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) and a [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) are here, stealing drinks from the store of brandy.

If the smugglers have been alerted, [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) (see appendix C and the following sidebar), one [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md), one [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), and one [bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) defend this room. [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) stays clear of the melee, taking cover behind the casks in the southeast corner. The hobgoblin and the bandit try to prevent the characters from entering the room, while the scout hangs back to fire its ranged weapon.

##### Treasure

The five bolts of silk are worth 50 gp each, and the eight casks of brandy are worth 10 gp apiece at market, though the merchants of Saltmarsh recognize the goods as stolen if the characters try to sell them there.

[Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) carries a [pipe of remembrance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pipe-of-remembrance-gos.md) (see appendix B) and a set of masterfully crafted loaded gaming dice (20 gp). The hobgoblin wears a suit of [mariner's armor (scale mail)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mariners-armor.md).

> [!note] Sanbalet
> 
> A tall man with a shaved head and piercing green eyes, the leader of the smugglers is as charismatic as he is cunning. [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md) is a plotting nemesis who prefers manipulation to direct action. It is no accident that his gang occupies the old house, since the promise of hidden knowledge initially drew him here.
> 
> Despite the disappointment of never finding the alchemist's secret chamber or other legendary arcane discoveries, the clever wizard saw opportunity in the house's ruined walls and shattered windows.
> 
> **What He Wants.** The smuggler wants to expand his operation and eventually inhabit a more secure location to better pursue his magical studies. He'd sacrifice every one of his companions to achieve these ends.
> 
> **Confidence Aplenty.** [Sanbalet](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sanbalet-gos.md)'s success stems from confidence in his abilities. He delights in criminal behavior and considers himself a great villain. He speaks of himself in the third person and exhibits narcissistic tendencies.
^sanbalet

#### 28. Sloping Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The incline of the passage is perceptibly greater in this area. Coarse matting has been laid in places on the floor, negating some of the slope's slipperiness.
^12f

Smugglers who fled from earlier encounters with the characters wait at the end of this passage, firing ranged weapons at the intruders as they attempt to navigate the narrow spots.

#### 29. Stock Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage widens to the south at this point to form a small cavern. There are three bolts of cloth and five small casks in the middle of the floor, resting on a piece of coarse matting.
^131

A lone [bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) is here if the smugglers aren't on alert.

If either of the [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) spells has been triggered, a lone [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) keeps watch here (guarding against an approach by sea) and joins the fray in area 27 if it hears sounds of combat.

The bolts and casks have the same value and conditions as those found in area 27.

#### 30. Sea Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage leads into a cave that opens directly to the sea. The tide is out at present, and there is little water in the cave, but there is an obvious high-water mark three feet above the floor. Pulled up onto the sloping cave floor is a small boat, perhaps large enough for eight people, with oars, a step-down mast, and a neatly furled sail. A rope tied to the bow is being held down by a large boulder that serves as an anchor.
^133

If the characters have avoided triggering either of the [magic mouth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-mouth.md) spells, the two [hobgoblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) smugglers are standing guard here.

There are no items of value in this area except the jolly boat, which might fetch as much as 100 gp. Since bolts of silk and casks of brandy are cumbersome, the characters can use this boat to transport the contraband to Saltmarsh.

### Conclusion

The town council of Saltmarsh gratefully rewards the characters 200 gp for uncovering and shutting down the smuggling operation.

Several days after the characters' return, or shortly before they depart town, they are invited to a meeting with the town council. This meeting begins the second part of the adventure.

## The Sea Ghost

In the next part of the adventure, the council asks the characters to take the fight to the remaining smugglers.

A few days after their triumphant return from the destruction of the smugglers' ring at the haunted house, the characters are hastily summoned to an emergency meeting of the Saltmarsh Town Council. Here it is explained to them that, though the land-based operation of the smuggling ring has been quashed, there must be a seagoing vessel by which the contraband was originally conveyed, and this is still at large. The council, fearful that any surviving smugglers could seek to reestablish their operation from some other base, asks the characters to apprehend this vessel and put an end, once and for all, to the smuggling.

A reward of 400 gp is offered to the characters for the successful conclusion of the mission.

### The Plan

The council reasons that the smugglers on the vessel are, as yet, unaware of the capture or death of their land-based colleagues, and a return visit by them might well be expected. Since the last consignment was offloaded only a short while ago, another one is not expected for some timeâ€”perhaps during the next new moon, which begins in about two weeks' time.

The council arranges for members of the town guard to patrol the potential rendezvous points each night for the next two weeks in case the smugglers return earlier than expected. If the ship is sighted, the council is unwilling to risk the lives of volunteers by ordering them to take the ship and its crew by force. As soon as an approaching vessel is spotted, the council expects the characters to perform the actual task of boarding.

Once the characters accept the undertaking, the council puts a small fishing boat at their disposal and provides them with any reasonable amount of nonmagical equipment that they feel they require. The boat is large enough to accommodate the entire party plus two. The council also provides the services of two members of the guard to sail the boat for them when needed. They are not willing to board the *Sea Ghost* with the characters, though they defend themselves and the fishing boat if it is attacked.

### The Signaling System

If the characters discovered the bullseye lantern and the parchment in area 22 of the haunted house, they have a big clue to how the smugglers communicate. You might require the characters to make a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to determine how the system worksâ€”although certain facts are not written on the parchment. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to experiment with sending signals when the ship comes back.

The signaling system utilizes the bullseye lantern to communicate the following messages by combining long and short flashes:

**Longâ€“shortâ€“shortâ€“short**: "Is it safe?" (The ship initiates the exchange with this signal.)

**Shortâ€“longâ€“shortâ€“long**: "Everything safe." (The smugglers respond with this signal.)

**Longâ€“longâ€“long**: "Ready to unload; come to the ship." (The ship confirms a reply with this signal.)

The arrangement calls for someone aboard the ship to flash the first signal. The shore party replies by flashing the second signal, after which the third signal flashes from the ship. It drops anchor and waits for the arrival of a boat from shore. A small group of smugglers approaches the ship in a rowboat. When it arrives, the ship sends a boat in the other direction. These two vessels alternate in transferring contraband between the ship and the shore, with one of them remaining in the shore cave at the end of the operation.

It has been arranged (though this does not appear on the parchment) for the first signal to be repeated every 10 minutes for an hour. If the ship gets no response, it is assumed that there is some delay and the *Sea Ghost* sails away, returning the next night.

The smugglers will drop anchor if the characters send any kind of return signal to the shipâ€”not necessarily the correct one. The crew of the *Sea Ghost* is accustomed to seeing an improper signal from time to time, because the gang on the shore often operates the lantern clumsily. Just in case something has gone awry, however, the ship's crew will be on alert when the characters make their approach.

### Boarding the Sea Ghost

How long it takes the characters to reach the ship depends on what arrangements they have made beforehand. If, for example, it is arranged that the guard members, once they have seen the ship, row ashore and pick the characters up (say in the cave below the haunted house), that takes 15 or 20 minutes. The characters then board the fishing boat, which is rowed out toward the ship. The journey to the ship takes 30 minutes (20 minutes with more than two rowing), but if the boat is to approach the *Sea Ghost* from the seaward side, another 5 minutes should be added. The ship is lying broadside to the coastline, the starboard side facing landward. If the characters approach it from this side, they are automatically seen when within 20 feet, even if they approach silently and without light.

If the characters approach silently from the port side, without using light sources, they will be totally unobservedâ€”the smugglers on deck are watching the coast from the starboard side and do not see or hear intruders who don't give themselves away. Thus, whether the alarm is raised or not depends on a number of factors: from which direction the boat approaches the ship, whether the watchers on the ship are alerted to possible danger (a previous incorrect response to the signal), and whether the characters have taken all precautions to conceal their approach.

Between the extremes outlined above (automatic detection of a direct approach or no detection of a silent and dark approach from the seaward side), you must judge the circumstances, decide on the probability of detection, and determine the outcome.

> [!note] Burning or Holing the Sea Ghost
> 
> Though it is possible for the characters to capture the *Sea Ghost*, they also might choose to destroy it.
> 
> **Burning.** The *Sea Ghost* is mainly of wooden construction, so fire always presents a hazard. The ship could, with some difficulty, be set ablaze and burned down to the waterline. The vessel will not ignite readily, for its hull, rigging, spars, and sails are all damp with sea water.
> 
> Deliberate attempts to set the ship ablaze can be undertaken only while aboard it. This involves the use of at least two flasks of oil applied to 2 cubic feet of dry, combustible material such as sacking, cloth, wool, or wood kindling, which is then set aflame. Bolts of silk soaked in brandy make excellent combustibles and do not require oil to be ignited. Use your discretion if the ship catches fire, but assume it burns to the waterline within 20 minutes.
> 
> **Holing.** Attempts to hole the ship and sink it require the use of axes or similar implements applied with vigor. This undertaking takes 5 minutes, but the noise alerts the smugglers. Two of them are sent to investigate and raise the alarm. The rest of the crew rapidly converge on the area and attack any intruders. If the hole is completed, the ship takes on water and sinks after an hour if the hole remains unrepaired.

#### Crow's Nest

This area is not shown on the map but isâ€”predictablyâ€”atop the mast, 40 feet above the main deck. Access to it is provided by a rope ladder whose lower end drops near the hatch on the main deck. The crow's nest is an open, wooden platform, 10 feet square with 3-foot-high wooden walls. Opening a 2-foot-square hatch in the floor lets out the rope ladder that descends to the main deck.

A single crew member ([bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) occupies this area when the party approaches the ship. The crew member looks toward the house and awaits a signal. There is no chance that he detects the characters' approach to the ship or their boarding of the ship if the others on board below fail to do soâ€”his gaze is fixed at a higher level.

If those on the deck below detect the characters' intrusion, the crew member's attention is attracted (even if his colleagues forget to alert him), and he descends with all speed to the deck to assist his mates. Otherwise, he is oblivious to the characters' intrusion unless someone climbs the rope ladder or the rigging to approach his position; he always detects such an approach when the climber is 15 feet below him, investigating and attacking if circumstances warrant it.

#### Bluffing Their Way On

If the characters make a direct approach, they can try to bluff their way aboard once they have been detected. For instance, they might say they are new recruits to the smuggling gang, unaccustomed to the codes and thus made a mistake with the signaling, or something of a similar nature.

If the story is reasonably convincing, allow the characters to make a DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. If the check is successful, they are believed up to the point when the first three characters get aboard by means of a rope ladder lowered for them. Once the characters' approach is detected, the entire crew attempts to repel the characters with the utmost vigor while getting their vessel under way.

#### Climbing Aboard

Climbing aboard the *Sea Ghost* undetected is no small feat. Keep in mind the following as the characters attempt to board:

- [Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) checks that rely on hearing are made with disadvantage on the ship because of the sound of the waves and sea.  
- The hull of the ship provides many handholds for climbing but is also very slippery. Climbing the hull without a rope or other device requires a successful DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a failed check, the climber falls into the water.  

### The Crew of the Sea Ghost

Aside from Captain Sigurd "Snake Eyes" ([pirate captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-captain-gos.md); see appendix C), the crew of the *Sea Ghost* consists of the following members:

- Bloody Bjorn, a [pirate first mate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-first-mate-gos.md) (see appendix C)  
- Foul Frithoff, a [pirate bosun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-bosun-gos.md) (see appendix C)  
- Punketah, a [pirate deck wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-deck-wizard-gos.md) (see appendix C)  
- 7 crew members ([bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md))  
- 3 [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md)  

The position of the crew aboard ship depends on two possible scenarios.

#### Correct Signal

If the characters sent a correct signal, the crew is relaxed. Two bandits await the characters in area 1. The rest of the crew can be found in their respective quarters (area 8 for the deck wizard, area 9 for the captain, area 13 for the first mate, area 14 for the bosun). The remaining five bandits occupy area 10.

#### Incorrect Signal

If the characters did not send the proper signal, the crew members are in the positions described in the text that follows.

The lizardfolk in area 7 do not help defend the ship unless they are directly threatened by the actions of the characters.

#### In Case of Surrender

If the ship's captain, the first mate, the bosun, and the deck wizard are all killed or have fled, and if the characters then outnumber the surviving crew and lizardfolk combined, the smugglers offer to surrender the ship to the characters. They seek the most advantageous terms they can get, but their minimum requirements will be their lives and liberty, and the ship's jolly boat in which to flee. If the characters refuse these terms, the smugglers offer to trade information in exchange for treasure. Their minimum requirement, in this case, is 100 gp to disclose the whereabouts of the secret cache of weapons and the fact they were to deliver these arms to the lizardfolk. They do not know the exact location of the rendezvous point, only that it is about ten miles or so along the coast west of the haunted house, near the mouth of a small river. For a further amount of 50 gp, they reveal the presence of the sea elf prisoner in area 14.

### The Smugglers' Ship

The name of the vessel, *Sea Ghost*, is painted on both sides of the prow. It has a length of nearly 90 feet, a beam of 26 feet, a draft of 8 feet, and stands 9 feet above the waterline to the top of its main deck rails and 17 feet above the waterline to the top of both its forecastle and poop deck. A jolly boat is lashed upside down on the main deck.

Normal doors are 6 feet high, 4 feet wide, and of stout wood construction. All are typically shut but unlocked, and all can be readily opened without special effort.

The stairways leading down from area 1 to areas 12 and 13 are separated from each other by a stout wood partition and form wood-enclosed companionways sealing them off from areas 8 and 9. The stairway from area 1 to area 10 is likewise enclosed in wood partitions and sealed off from area 6. All enclosed areas have a ceiling height of 8 feet except for the bilge (area 16), which is 4 feet high. The cargo hold hatch in area 1 is closed but not fastened. The bilge hatch in area 11 is closed and bolted from the hold side only.

### Ship Locations

The following areas are identified on map 2.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2.3: Sea Ghost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/018-03-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/019-03-pc.webp#gallery)

#### 1. Main Deck

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Though the light is dim at best, you can see details of the ship's main deck. In the center, forward of the mast, a jolly boat is lashed to the deck with ropes.
> 
> Aft of the mast is a hatch to the belowdecks area and a rope ladder climbing to a crow's nest above.
> 
> Two human figures lean against the rail mid-deck, staring toward the coast. Between them at deck level is a roll of canvas or rope.
> 
> To fore and aft, below the upper decks, stand vague outlines of doors. You can also see ladders that lead to the upper decks, the aft one on the port side, the forward one on the starboard.
^147

The hatch leads to the hold (area 11) below. Between the two figures waits a 25-foot-long rope ladder, ready to be thrown over the side. Two 25-foot lengths of rope also lie neatly coiled at opposite edges of the deck.

The two figures are Bloody Bjorn ([pirate first mate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-first-mate-gos.md); see appendix C) and a crew member ([bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)).

#### 2. Forecastle

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A massive shape in the center of the deck area must be the ship's capstan. From it, the anchor chain runs down the chain vent to port of the prow.
> 
> Standing near the bowsprit is a human figure. He appears to be scanning to starboard.
^149

The capstan arms can be removed and used as clubs. They have been left in the capstan by express orders of the captain, who wants to be able to make a quick getaway if such proves necessary.

The figure is a single crew member ([bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) watching for any signals from shore.

#### 3. Poop Deck

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tiller is the most prominent feature of this area, rising from the deck about six feet from the stern and having a horizontal arm some six feet long. Against this arm, on the starboard side and looking coastward, stands a human figure.
> 
> Leaning on the starboard rail and looking toward the coast are three human figures. The one nearest the stern holds something in his hand at shoulder level; occasionally he adjusts it in some way.
^14b

The figure leaning against the tiller is a crew member ([bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)). The others, from fore to aft, are Punketah ([pirate deck wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-deck-wizard-gos.md); see appendix C), the ship's captain Sigurd "Snake Eyes" ([pirate captain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-captain-gos.md); see appendix C) and another crew member ([bandit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)). The last holds a [bullseye lantern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bullseye-lantern.md) that has a shutter over its lens; from time to time the crew member moves the shutter and sends out the prearranged signal.

#### 4. Galley Stores

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From iron hooks set into the ceiling hang three long strings of sausages, a large ham, and a hunk of meat. Against the hull are three sacks. Set against the bulkhead beside the door are a cask and a ceramic jar. Against the other bulkhead are set a large and a small cask and another ceramic jar. There is an opening in the latter bulkhead about three feet square and with its lower edge about three feet above the deck.
^14d

The area is unoccupied.

The meat is salt beef; the sacks contain dried beans; the casks contain flour, salt, and ale; and the jars contain honey and olive oil. The ship's food stores are relatively fresh, though nothing is particularly appetizing.

#### 5. Ship's Stores

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two coiled lengths of rope and three rolls of sailcloth lie on the deck alongside a large box. A large wooden cask stands next to six lengths of wood planking. Set into a wooden rack, fastened to the bulkhead by the door, are two metal-headed hammers, two wooden mallets, two saws, and an adze. There is an opening, about three feet square and with its lower edge about seven feet above the deck, in the other bulkhead.
^14f

The area is unoccupied.

Each rope is 100 feet long. The box contains copper nails, and the cask is three-quarters full of hard, dry tar. These supplies are used to make regular repairs about the ship.

#### 6. Ship's Galley

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A crude metal stove, not lit, leans against the hull. It has an adjustable metal chimney that can be placed through a vent hole when it is opened. Next to the stove is an open metal bin containing sticks of wood kindling, and beside this is a large wood table, bolted firmly to the deck, with a thick top crisscrossed with score marks. The table has a large drawer.
> 
> Hanging from hooks set into the hull above the table are two iron frying pans, two saucepans, and a skillet. Set against the bulkhead opposite is a large cask filled with clear liquid. Beside this stands a wooden cupboard. Against the bulkhead beside the forward door is a wooden upright chair, and hanging from the center of the deck above is an unlit, hooded lantern.
^151

There is nothing of significant value here, and the area is unoccupied.

The drawer, which is unlocked, holds an assortment of butcher's knives, saws, and choppers. The cask contains water, while the cupboard holds a miscellany of tin mugs, small and large tin plates, wooden platters, and a metal dipper.

#### 7. Lizardfolk Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A distinct odor about this room reminds you of a marsh or a swampâ€”not fetid, not oppressive, but certainly noticeable.
> 
> In the center of the area is a wood table, bolted to the deck. On the table sits a silver jug half full of a red liquid; with it are three pewter mugs. Around the table are set three upright wooden chairs, and an unlit hooded lantern hangs from the ceiling above.
> 
> In the gloom, you can see three hammocksâ€”one at each end of the cabin slung between the bulkhead and one of the ship's ribs, and the third hanging across the corner of the cabin from next to the aft door to the central bulkhead. Each hammock is occupied by a scaled figure.
> 
> A small chest or box of some sort lies under the most forward hammock. There appear to be weapons under each of the hammocks.
^153

Three [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) warriors occupy the hammocks. The chest and its contents are their property. The lizardfolk were provided by the chieftain of their clan to help ensure that the smuggled weapons in area 15 make it to their lair. When they become aware of the characters, they initially assume they are smugglers and treat them as such, demanding in a combination of Draconic and broken Common to know when the weapons will be delivered to their kinfolk.

A [pseudodragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md) named Bimz sleeps in a small nest behind the chest. It is the companion of one of the lizardfolk and joins in the combat to defend its master.

Combat in this small room is hampered by its size and low ceilings. Melee attacks made with two-handed weapons have disadvantage in this room.

##### Development

If Bimz is still alive when its master dies, it stops attacking and retreats to its nest. It continues to fight only if pursued. After the remaining lizardfolk are dealt with, Bimz chooses one character and bonds with that individual. Bimz prefers to bond with a party member that did not directly attack it, is good-aligned, and also did not directly attack its lizardfolk master. If no character meets all those conditions, the one who met the most conditions will suffice. Alternatively, the characters can engage in a contest of Charisma checks (highest wins) to determine whom Bimz bonds with.

##### Treasure

A silver jug on the table contains wine and is worth 25 gp.

The chest is locked and can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The key to the chest lies under a hammock; it can be noticed by someone who succeeds on DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or by a character who closely examines the hammock.

The chest is also trapped with a poison needle. Noticing the trap requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check is required to disarm the trap. Opening the chest without disarming the trap, or failing to disarm it, triggers the trap.

When triggered, the trap fires a small poisoned dart from the lock. Any creature standing in front of the lock is automatically struck by the needle, taking 1 piercing damage and 4 (`1d4 + 2`) poison damage.

The chest contains ten electrum ingots worth 100 ep each. These ingots are another part of the payment for the consignment of weapons, to be handed over on completion of delivery.

#### 8. Punketah's Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This seems to be one of the master cabins. The furnishings and fittings are of good quality, and the place is tidy.
> 
> A single bunk, made up with bed linen, has its head against a bulkhead running along the centerline of the ship.
> 
> A polished wood table stands in the center of the room, bolted to the deck. On the table is a silver bowl containing an assortment of fruit, a silver carafe half full of a light red liquid, and a silver goblet. Set at the table are two upright wooden chairs and a padded leather chair.
> 
> On the deck toward the stern is a wooden, brass-bound chest. Beside it is a pair of highly polished black leather boots. From the center of the ceiling, over the table, hangs an unlit hooded lantern.
^157

This cabin is the private quarters of Punketah, the [deck wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-deck-wizard-gos.md). On a peg behind the door hangs a maroon robe, of no particular value.

Examining the boots in combination with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check reveals a small hidden compartment in one of the heels. The compartment contains the key to the chest.

##### Treasure

The chest is locked and can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

The chest is also trapped with poisonous gas. Noticing the trap requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check is required to disarm the trap. Opening the chest without disarming the trap, or failing to disarm it, triggers the trap.

When it is triggered, the trap releases a cloud of noxious gas in a 5-foot radius around the chest. Creatures caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be knocked [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for `1d4` minutes.

The chest holds items of clothing, a leather purse containing 50 gp, and a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of [gust of wind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md). It also holds Punketah's spellbook, which has all the spells he has prepared recorded on its pages.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/ghosts-of-saltmarsh/img/020-02-09.webp#center)

#### 9. Captain's Cabin

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cabin is clean, and its furniture in good repair.
> 
> A single bunk, made up with bed linen, has its head against the bulkhead running along the centerline of the ship next to a wooden partition squaring off the corner near the main deck.
> 
> A writing desk is set against the hull toward the stern; it has a drawer on each side and three trays on the top. Also on the desktop, just in front of the trays, is an inkpot, two quill pens, a small knife, and a pewter container that resembles a pepper pot. Against the desk is set an upright wooden chair, and beside it is a wooden, brass-bound chest.
> 
> Against the hull on the starboard side is a padded leather couch. In front of it, a bearskin rug lies on the deck, while beneath the couch can be seen a large metal box. An unlit hooded lantern hangs from the ceiling.
^15a

A gray cloak (with no special properties) hangs on a peg on the back of the door. The wooden chest beside the desk is unlocked. It contains items of clothing, including a well-worn, comfortable pair of slippers.

##### Writing Desk

Of the trays on the desktop next to the pewter container (which is nearly full of fine sand), one is empty and another contains bills and receipts for various items of marine supply. The last contains several letters of a personal and intimate nature from three different women in three different ports (each of whom is under the misapprehension that she is Mrs. Sigurd "Snake Eyes"), and a curious, semiliterate document requesting a further supply of ironware "as per previous consignments and at the agreed terms." The signature here is in the form of a pictograph and shows a lizard with forked tongue extended.

This last document is a request from the lizardfolk for more weapons. You should exercise caution here in not making the document too explicitâ€”the lizardfolk would not want the document to fall into the wrong hands and have concealed as much of the real meaning of the request as possibleâ€”for instance, using words like "goods" instead of "weapons."

The two desk drawers are locked; a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can open one drawer. The key to both drawers is in Captain Sigurd's belt pouch.

The first drawer contains two [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md), a dose of [antitoxin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/antitoxin-vial.md), and the key that unlocks the chains holding [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) in area 14.

The second drawer contains seven maps of various sea and coastal localities, prepared by professional cartographers. Beneath these is another map, crudely drawn. This map indicates that the rendezvous point with the lizardfolk is at a small promontory beside a river in the tidal marshes, ten miles southwest of the town of Saltmarsh.

The bearskin rug covers a hatch in the floor that provides access to area 13.

##### Treasure

The chest under the couch is locked and can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The chest is trapped with a swinging blade trap. Noticing the trap requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check is required to disarm the trap. Opening the chest without disarming the trap, or failing to disarm it, triggers the trap.

When triggered, the trap swings a short scything blade from its bottom, threatening any creature within 5 feet of the front of the chest. Such creatures must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (`2d6`) slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

The chest contains ten electrum ingots worth 100 ep each. This is part of the payment made by the lizardfolk for the smuggled weapons in area 15.

#### 10. Crew Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Various unpleasant odors of humanoid occupation compete for recognition here. These crew quarters fill the entire forward part of this deck.
> 
> A companionway staircase leads up from a point about six feet from the bulkhead. Near it, more to starboard, is a door.
> 
> Around the perimeter of the cabin, slung between hooks on the bulkhead and on supporting poles, are eight hammocks. Judging from the way in which they hang, the hammocks seem to be unoccupied at present. Beneath each hammock is a brass-bound wooden sea chestâ€”most are closed, but two have open lids and appear to contain clothes.
> 
> In the center of the cabin stands a long, plain wooden table with a bench along each of its longer sides. They all appear to be bolted to the deck in an attempt to keep everything in place.
> 
> The table is stained and cluttered and has an untidy pile of dirty tin plates and cups roughly stacked in a large tin bucket below it. Over the table, hanging from the ceiling, is an unlit hooded lantern.
> 
> Against the starboard side, an area has been curtained off by cheap, dirty cloth hangings.
^15e

The curtained area contains two large tin buckets standing side by side on the floor. Both are empty, but they are stained and dirty and emit a foul smell.

The sea chests contain clothes and other personal effects. The garments are all stained, grubby, and in poor condition. Of minor interest among the remaining items are the following:

- A pack of well-used, greasy playing cards (examination reveals the deck has two aces of spades)  
- Two sets of dice, one of them loaded  
- A book titled Grog Hovels, which describes taverns and inns along the coastline suitable for patronage by a pirate  

#### 11. Cargo Hold

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Lantern light reveals an orderly cargo hold. Through the center runs the base of the main mast; beside it, narrow wooden stairs lead up to the hatch above. Against the aft bulkhead are stacked bolts of cloth, lashed by ropes to brackets bolted to the deck so they are secure. On each side are stacked a large number of small casks, also secured by ropes to the deck.
^160

A lantern hanging from the ceiling, positioned just forward of the main mast, provides bright illumination. The characters can see the plain wooden hatch that allows access to the bilge, forward of the mast.

Four crew members ([bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) under the supervision of Foul Frithoff ([pirate bosun](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-bosun-gos.md); see appendix C) are wandering about the hold, securing the cargo and taking inventory. They chat about all manner of depraved conquests as they do. Once they become aware of the party, they attack immediately.

##### Treasure

The hold contains the following cargo:

50 bolts of silk (50 gp each)

40 casks of brandy (10 gp each)

40 casks of fine wine (7 gp each)

1 large crate of high-quality mining tools (200 gp)

#### 12. Bosun's Cabin

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the center of the cabin sits a plain wood table on which stand a pewter flagon and a pewter mug. Beside the table is a wooden chair, and hanging over the table is an unlit hooded lantern.
> 
> Also hanging from the ceiling, at the aft end of the cabin, is a large cage that holds a parrot, apparently asleep. Next to the hull hangs an unoccupied hammock. Beneath it is a brass-bound wooden sea chest.
^163

The flagon is full of a rough, high-proof cider.

Finding the secret door into area 14 requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

##### Cuppa the Parrot

When anyone enters the cabin, the parrot immediately wakes, squawks, repeats "Pieces of eight" several times, squawks again, and then falls quiet. Its cries do not alert or alarm the smugglers, who are used to the noisy bird.

##### Development

The prisoner in area 14 might hear the characters in the bosun's cabin. [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) shouts to attract their attention if he overhears someone speaking Aquan or Elvish.

##### Treasure

The sea chest is unlocked and contains, grubby garments of no value. Concealed by the garments is a locked (but not trapped) iron box. The key to the box is in Foul Frithoff's belt pouch. The box can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. It contains 200 sp, a spear, a dagger, and the remains of a crossbow. The weapons belong to [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md), the sea elf who is imprisoned in area 14. The crossbow is damaged beyond repair.

#### 13. First Mate's Cabin

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cabin occupies half the stern section on this deck, with one bulkhead running along the centerline of the ship. Along this bulkhead, leading up in the direction of the bow, is an enclosed companionway. At its foot, a door in the central bulkhead leads to the other part of the stern. On this door hangs a dark blue cloak.
> 
> A single bunk, the bed linen heaped in a pile, is set against the hull. At its foot is a brass-bound wooden sea chest, its lid closed. Under the bunk is a brass box, also closed.
> 
> In the center of the cabin, a plain wooden table is bolted to the deck. On it are two books, one open and propped up against the other. Beside the table is a wooden chair. Hanging from the ceiling over the table is an unlit hooded lantern.
> 
> Just aft of the hook that holds the lantern is a hatch measuring three feet on a side.
^168

The cloak has no special properties and no significant value.

Finding the secret door into area 15 requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

##### Books

The table has the following books (worth 10 gp apiece) lying on it:

*Principles of Navigation* by Da Korma (open)

*Legal Distinctions in Letters of Marque* by Tazaar (closed)

##### Treasure

The sea chest is neither locked nor trapped. It contains some garments and a pair of boots, mostly quite old but reasonably clean.

The brass box under the bed is locked. The key to the box is in Bloody Bjorn's belt pouch. It can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The box contains 500 sp.

#### 14. Secret Prison Cell

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dark, cramped area only four feet wide at most, squeezed in between the ship's stern and the adjacent cabin, appears to be a holding cell. A slim humanoid figure cowers in the far corner, chained to the hull.
^16c

The figure is that of a sea elf; the key to unlock his chains can be found in the captain's writing desk drawer (see area 9). If the characters demonstrate friendship and release him, [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) (see appendix C) has an interesting story to relate and will assist the characters to the best of his ability in their undertaking. [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) speaks Aquan as well as Elvish.

If invited to do so, he joins the characters with enthusiasm and stays with them throughout the conclusion of this adventure. He will, if requested to do so, remain with the characters for further adventures (assuming that they continue with *Danger at Dunwater* and possibly also *The Final Enemy*), in which circumstances you could ask one of the players to play [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md). At all times he will be as cooperative as possible, playing a full role as an NPC in the party's undertakings (he will, of course, expect a normal portion of treasure). Afterward, he reluctantly leaves them to return home.

> [!note] A Prisoner from the Deep
> 
> Assuming that the characters befriend [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) and have a way to communicate with him, the elf provides the following information.
> 
> **How He Became Imprisoned.** [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) is a member of the tribe of Manaan, which inhabits an undersea settlement about twenty miles southeast of Saltmarsh. He was stripped of his weapons and armor when imprisoned, but though bruised and hungry, he has suffered no great injury and his spirit is undaunted.
> 
> His tribe has noted, from a distance, the periodic travels of the *Sea Ghost* at night along a supposedly deserted coastal area. Suspicious of this behavior, the tribal chief ordered [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) to keep watch on this area, slip aboard when the ship arrived, and follow the ship back to its port of origin to discover what he could of these strange proceedings. This [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) did, and at the vessel's home port he witnessed the stowing aboard of a small arsenal of weaponry. He was then discovered, knocked out, and taken prisoner. He awakened some time later, chained to the ship's hull in this compartment.
> 
> **Since His Imprisonment.** He is uncertain how long he has been a prisoner or what his ultimate fate would have been He has no knowledge of the lizardfolk aboard (he has not seen them), nor does he or any member of his tribe know for whom the arms are intended.
> 
> During his imprisonment he has been brought unpleasant food three times and a cup of brackish, stale water about six times. On each occasion the bearer has been a large bully of a person with a hook instead of a left hand (the bosun, though [Oceanus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/oceanus-gos.md) does not know this). These visitations aside, he has been left to his own devices.

#### 15. The Secret Cache

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cramped area, only four feet wide at the widest, is sandwiched between the adjacent cabin and the ship's stern. It contains eight large, irregularly shaped bundles wrapped in oilskin and bound with light rope. These are piled at random on the deck, as though thrown in casually from the doorway.
^171

This is the place in which the weapons are housed during their journey to the customers (the lizardfolk). The eight bundles here contain the following equipment:

10 [morningstars](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/morningstar.md)

10 [longswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md)

10 [shields](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md)

20 [javelins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/javelin.md)

1 shield emblazoned on the front with the design of a lizard with forked tongue extended

There is no identification of any sort on any of the mismatched bundles, nor is there anything else stored in this area.

#### 16. Bilge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From the hatchway, you can see a little of what lies in the gloom below. This area stretches the full width of the ship and, for all you can see, the full length, for no bulkheads are in view. What must be the bottom of the ship is covered with a thick layer of wet sand (presumably ballast) on top of which is an inch or so of green, greasy water.
> 
> A scuttling noise toward the stern indicates there is some life down hereâ€”perhaps living off the garbage thrown in occasionally by the lazy crew, for there are heaps of trash immediately below the hatch that have formed small islands in the fetid water. A particularly large one has accumulated at the base of the mast.
> 
> As you move your light back and forth, you catch a yellow reflection in one of the garbage piles.
^173

A number of [rats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/rat.md) eke out a precarious existence here, but they are of the normal variety and harmless. The bilge offers only 4 feet of headroom.

Two [swarms of rot grubs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rot-grubs-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) live in the garbage island around the mast. A gold coin among the trash is the source of the reflection. The rot grubs attack anyone who comes near.

##### Treasure

A paltry 2 gp can be found inside the garbage island with the rot grubs.

### Conclusion

If the characters have successfully completed their mission, the seagoing side of the smuggling operation has been rendered inoperative. The ramifications of that are discussed in the following section, "Smuggled Goods."

In addition, the characters have gained some or all the following information:

- In addition to contraband, the smugglers are providing weapons to a colony of lizardfolk.  
- The lizardfolk colony is located within ten miles of Saltmarsh.  
- This weapon smuggling appears to have been going on for some months.  

If they have enough information, the characters should be able to deduce that the lizardfolk are planning an attack, either on Saltmarsh or on some other unknown location. Presented with this information, the town council is sure to have further need of the party.

Of course, the characters do not know the truth behind the lizardfolk's need to purchase weapons. To learn the truth, more of the story must unfold. See chapter 3, Danger at Dunwater.

#### Smuggled Goods

The smugglers are very successful. Their main source of income is the sale of stolen goods, especially those marked with a royal seal or similar identifier that would make dealing with legitimate merchants impossible. They also take in goods from ships they have waylaid, usually spices, weapons, poisons, and other contraband that is either illegal or heavily taxed in this region. Currently, the ship's hold is crowded with mining equipment and kegs of brandy stolen from a royal shipment meant for a crown-sponsored mining operation in this region, along with silks that were originally destined for a royal trade mission.

If the characters break the smuggling ring, they are free to keep whatever other treasure they find without consequence, but the current contents of the hold must be handled carefully.

Representatives of the crown in Saltmarsh will pay 200 gp for the return of the silk and brandy stored under the house (in area 27) and 500 gp for the merchandise aboard the *Sea Ghost* (the goods in area 11 and the weapons in area 15).

Royal agents might also claim the smugglers' ship, but at your option, if the characters have proven eager to aid the crown, they are given the ship and pledged the service of a contingent of sailors to man it for one year.

If the characters keep the merchandise and try to sell it openly in the region, they find no buyers. Such an attempt earns them a poor reputation, the effect of which is up to you.

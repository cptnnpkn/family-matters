# Chapter 2: Trouble in Phandalin
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk, p. 27* 

The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, old Phandalin was a thriving town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver Pact. However, the same bandits who sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave attacked the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, hardy folk from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun settling atop the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier town has developed on the site of the old settlement. It's home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few ruffians and bandits have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has been hounding Phandalin, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk only as "Glasstaff."

![Phandalin's locals heartil...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/017-02-001-ch2-splash.webp#center "Phandalin's locals heartily welcome friendly visitors")

## Running This Chapter

In this chapter, the characters meet important townspeople who become their quest givers and friends throughout the adventure. By the time the mind flayer fanatics' plot against Phandalin becomes clear in later chapters, the characters' attachment to one or more NPCs in town should encourage them to save it. For now, consider portraying the townsfolk as friendly and curious about the adventurers to encourage these ties.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 2nd level when the chapter begins. The characters gain a level when they finish exploring the Redbrand hideout under Tresendar Manor.

## Welcome to Phandalin

When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.
> 
> As you approach, you see children playing on the town green, and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at the shops in town. Many people look up and smile as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.
^063

The characters can visit various locations in Phandalin and talk to the townsfolk.

When he hired the characters, [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md) provided an overview of the town and its locations to them. If the characters are using different adventure hooks, other people have told the characters about the town. Either way, the characters should have a rudimentary understanding of Phandalin's layout.

At this point, show the players map 2.1. The characters arrive at Phandalin in the evening, so they have time to visit a few places before they must seek lodging for the night.

Some locales the characters could visit include the following:

- **Barthen's Provisions.** If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, they're meant to deliver it to this shop.  
- **Lionshield Coster.** If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.  
- **Stonehill Inn.** If the characters have [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill Inn appears to be the best available option.  

## Encounters in Phandalin

If the players aren't sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs can direct the characters toward various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town.

### Redbrand Ruffians Appear

You can decide when the characters run into the Redbrands, the criminal gang that runs Phandalin. After the characters have visited several locations in town and talked to the townsfolk, they might decide to confront the Redbrands. When they do, run the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.

### Finding Cragmaw Castle

The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to rescue [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md). Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, however, and no one in town knows the exact location of Cragmaw Castle; however, Qelline Alderleaf and [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.

### Strange Goblins

The characters might be intrigued about the strange goblins with elongated skulls who wield green energy. Although the townspeople are focused on their troubles with the Redbrands, some disclose odd run-ins with the strange goblins. Descriptions of these run-ins appear in later sections.

### Important NPCs

The Phandalin NPCs table summarizes the most important NPCs in Phandalin and their relevance to the adventure. Unless otherwise noted, these NPCs are human and use the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block.

## Town Description

Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a day. If the players choose to split up their characters, they can cover more ground, but splitting the party makes the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter potentially more dangerous.

The following sections detail specific locations in town, as shown on map 2.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2.1: Phandalin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/018-map-2-01-phandalin.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/019-map-2-01-phandalin-player.webp#gallery)

### Stonehill Inn

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the center of town, opposite the town green, stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.
^06b

The Stonehill Inn has five of its six rooms free ([Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) occupies the sixth room). Should the characters need more space or want to stay elsewhere, they can camp outside town, or they can persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.

The inn's proprietor is a friendly young human man named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen doesn't like the Redbrands at all, though he tries not to make trouble for fear that they might retaliate against his wife and children.

#### Rumors

Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with several good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include the following:

**Elsa**, a dwarf bartender: "Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer." (See the "Edermath Orchard" section for more information.) Elsa also brags about her sister, Gwyn, who is a scholar in the city of Neverwinter. Gwyn arrives in town shortly after the characters and becomes a major NPC in later chapters.

**Freda**, a gnome weaver: "The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange. They don't want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it." (See the "Phandalin Miner's Exchange" section for more information.)

**Lanar**, a human miner: "Marauders have been attacking trade caravans on the east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off. I think goblins are working with the marauders, too!" (See the "Townmaster's Hall" section for more information.)

**Narth**, a human farmer: "Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded." (See the "Shrine of Luck" section for more information.)

**Pip**, Toblen's son: "Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but the Redbrands almost caught him! He also saw weird goblins hanging around!" (Carp is Qelline Alderleaf's son. See the "Alderleaf Farm" section for more information.)

**Toblen**, the human innkeeper: "Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and bullied his wife. The ruffians provoked a fight and murdered Thel. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing." (The Redbrands took the family to their secret hideout; see the "Redbrands' Hideout" section.)

In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town.

### Barthen's Provisions

Barthen's Provisions is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. It stocks most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's doesn't stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, except for items that cost more than 25 gp. Characters who ask for weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see below).

The proprietor is Elmina Barthen, a young human woman with a kindly manner. She employs a couple of clerks, Ander and Thistle, who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Elmina isn't around.

#### Delivery

If the characters began play with the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen's. Elmina pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell her of [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md)'s capture, Elmina encourages the party to rescue the dwarf. She considers Gundren a friend and was excited by his talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn't already learned details of the mine from [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md), a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of chapter 1.

Elmina also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Elmina hasn't seen them in a tenday and expects the brothers to return "any day now" to resupply. What Elmina doesn't know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. (See chapter 4 for more information.)

#### Elmina's News

If the characters ask Elmina for news of the town, the shopkeeper reluctantly admits that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. She knows that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Edermath Orchard

Daran Edermath is a retired drow adventurer. He lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard that grew wild long ago, and he is working to clear out the underbrush and cultivate the orchard again. Daran is well over five hundred years old, and he has worked as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the south. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.

Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a group of faithful seekers of justice who protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he's no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He's happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.

![Order of the Gauntlet Pin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/020-02-003-order-of-the-gauntlet-pin.webp#center)

#### Daran's Suspicions

Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of heroes teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it's time someone took a stand against their leader, whom the outlaws refer to as "Glasstaff." He knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the Redbrands' safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the "Tresendar Manor" section for more information.)

#### Old Owl Trouble

Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by foul undead. He asks the characters to head to the ruins, a couple of days' march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and what they're doing. Daran knows the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the characters can ensure that no threat to the town is brewing at Old Owl Well, Daran is willing to give them his [boots of striding and springing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/boots-of-striding-and-springing.md). The magical boots came in handy when Daran adventured, but he no longer needs them. If the party pursues this quest, see "Old Owl Well" in chapter 3.

> [!note] 
> 
> Joining the Order of the Gauntlet
> 
> If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates the Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Order of the Gauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor, vigilance, and righteous zeal. If a character agrees, Daran awards the individual the title of "Chevall" and hands them a pin that represents the order. This rank and faction won't affect this adventure, but it's significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.

### Lionshield Coster

![Linene Graywind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/021-02-002-linene-graywind.webp#center)

A wooden sign shaped like a shield and painted with a blue lion hangs above the door of this trading post. The building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hit hard by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

The owner of the Phandalin post is a human woman named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.

In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale. Linene worries about Phandalin's safety, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town.

#### Recovered Goods

If the characters return the stolen goods recovered in area H8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene offers a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can. She warns the characters that the Redbrands are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Phandalin Miner's Exchange

The Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

![Zhentarim Pin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/022-02-004-zhentarim-pin.webp#center)

The guild master is a quick-witted and ruthless human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working to slowly bring Phandalin under her control, and she can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her.

#### Halia's Job Offer

If the characters ask about the Redbrands, Halia describes how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to capture the Redbrands' leader, whom the outlaws call "Glasstaff," and bring her any correspondence found in his quarters.

The characters are wise to be cautious when dealing with Halia. She doesn't reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrands herself. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check indicates Halia has ulterior motives for removing the Redbrands' leader.

Further, in chapter 4, Halia smuggles [Nezznar the Spider](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/nezznar-the-spider-pabtso.md) out of town and into the Zhentarim's custody, allowing the villain to escape justice.

> [!note] 
> 
> Joining the Zhentarim
> 
> If the party dispatches the Redbrands' leader, Halia Thornton converses with the characters to determine if any are candidates for membership in the Zhentarim. She is looking for people focused on wealth, power, and influence. If any characters meet her approval, she privately urges them to join the Zhentarim. Even if the party wipes out the entire Redbrand gang, Halia may still extend the offer in an effort to gain powerful friends (and spies) within the party. If a character agrees, Halia gives the individual the title of "Fang" and hands them a pin that represents the Zhentarim. This title and faction won't affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.
^078

### Alderleaf Farm

Qelline Alderleaf is a wise and pragmatic halfling farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don't want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.

#### Carp's Story

Qelline's son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer. He was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of "big scary bandits" came out of the tunnel when he was there and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close. Carp thinks the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He also saw some strange goblins with "glowing hands" duck into the tunnel. Carp can take the characters to the tunnel if asked, or he can give them directions to the location. The cave leads to area R8 in the Redbrands' hideout.

#### Finding Cragmaw Castle

Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If Qelline realizes the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle, she suggests the characters visit Reidoth and ask for her help, "since there's not an inch of the land the druid doesn't know." Qelline tells the characters Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and Qelline provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party pursues this quest, see "Ruins of Thundertree" in chapter 3.

### Shrine of Luck

Phandalin's only temple, this small shrine is made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, the god of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands and other evil influences. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout Faerûn to thwart tyrants and despots. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.

![Harpers Pin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/023-02-005-harpers-pin.webp#center)

#### Sister Garaele's Bargain

Recently, Garaele's superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted to persuade a dangerous banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele underestimated Agatha's wrath when she attempted to approach the banshee.

Before she fled for her life, Garaele noted that the banshee spoke wistfully about the beautiful baubles she owned in life. Garaele needs an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift—a jeweled silver comb—and persuade the banshee to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who pays obeisance to Agatha might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the mission to the characters and will give them three [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see "Conyberry and Agatha's Lair" in chapter 3.

> [!note] 
> 
> Joining the Harpers
> 
> If the party helps Sister Garaele and learns from Agatha the fate of Bowgentle's spellbook, Garaele privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Harpers. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network and possess a desire to enact positive change by gathering intelligence. If a character agrees, Garaele awards the individual the title of "Watcher" and hands them a pin to represent the Harpers. This rank and faction won't affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.
^07e

### Sleeping Giant

This run-down tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin's main street. It is frequented by Redbrands and operated by a surly orc named Greska. If the characters choose to visit the place, see the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.

### Townmaster's Hall

![Harbin Wester](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/024-02-006-harbin-wester.webp#center)

Phandalin has no functioning government, but the village elects a "townmaster" each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps important records. The current townmaster is a human banker named Harbin Wester, a cheerful and well-liked, but timid leader. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, Harbin initially claims that they're "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really."

The townmaster's hall has a small but serviceable jail with two cells. Harbin eventually admits to the characters that the Redbrands should be captured so they can stand trial and potentially be sent to Neverwinter for imprisonment.

#### Dangerous Trail

Harbin posts official notices on a board beside the door of the townmaster's hall. He's looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where marauders have attacked several caravans near Wyvern Tor. The most recent victims reported that at least one strange goblin accompanied the marauders, who consist of at least an ogre and some bugbears. Harbin is offering a 100 gp contract to any group that can drive the marauders and any goblin companions away. If the party pursues this quest, see "Wyvern Tor" in chapter 3.

#### Finding Cragmaw Castle

After recovering at the Stonehill Inn, [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) establishes himself at the townmaster's hall. As an agent of the Lords' Alliance, his goal is to see Phandalin thrive and become prosperous. Therefore, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production.

Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the band's leader. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see the random encounters in chapter 3).

![Lords' Alliance Pin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/025-02-007-lords-alliance-pin.webp#center)

#### Finding Iarno Albrek

Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords' Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what's left of him if he is dead. Sildar describes Iarno as "a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties."

In reality, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the pseudonym "Glasstaff" to conceal his true identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have Iarno captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

> [!note] 
> 
> Joining the Lords' Alliance
> 
> If the party eliminates the threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno's treachery, [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Lords' Alliance. He speaks with those who exemplify a commitment to protecting vulnerable folk. If a character agrees, [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) awards the individual the title of "Cloak" and hands them a pin to represent the Lords' Alliance. This rank and faction won't affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.
^084

### Tresendar Manor

More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold. If the characters investigate this place, they find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout (described below).

## Redbrand Ruffians

![A group of criminals who w...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/026-02-008-redbrand-ruffians.webp#center "A group of criminals who wear scarlet cloaks has been causing trouble in Phandalin for a while now")

Within a day or so of the adventurers' arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in several different ways:

- **Confront the Redbrands.** After speaking with a few NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant.  
- **Investigate Tresendar Manor.** The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter below and go straight to "Redbrands' Hideout."  
- **Redbrand Confrontation.** If the characters show no signs of going after the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in the town streets. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.  

If the characters confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town. Several disheveled, surly humans linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks. Their stares are fixed on you as you approach.
> 
> One of the ruffians spits on the ground. "Well, well," he says. "Here's a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want here, puppies? Come down here to bark at us?"
^087

If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you head into the street, you find several armed, surly humans waiting for you. Their scarlet cloaks are grimy, and they place their hands on their weapons as they watch you.
> 
> One of the ruffians spits on the ground. "You've been asking too many questions," he snarls. "Time to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff and be on your way."
^088

Continue the baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters don't. Neither side is surprised because it's obvious a fight is brewing.

Four [Redbrand ruffians](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/redbrand-ruffian-pabtso.md) fight the characters. The ruffians are not overly brave. If three of the Redbrands are defeated, the remaining ruffian flees toward Tresendar Manor.

### Development

Redbrands who are captured, persuaded, or [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the characters can impart useful information (see "What the Redbrands Know" below). The characters can easily convince Townmaster Harbin Wester to keep an eye on any prisoners they capture for at least a few days.

If the characters kill the ruffians, the townmaster expresses his fear of retaliation.

> [!note] 
> 
> Are the Players Lost?
> 
> After the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter, the players should realize it's time to deal with the rest of the gang. If they aren't clear that investigating the Redbrands' hideout should be their next move, have one of the NPCs they've met in town ask the characters to investigate Tresendar Manor. However, if the players choose to avoid conflict with the Redbrands because they want to follow other leads in the area, it's okay to move on to chapter 3 and let the ruffians wait. The next time the characters return to Phandalin, make it clear that the Redbrands are causing even more trouble and that they need to be dealt with. Some of the Redbrands may also bring the fight to the characters.

## Redbrands' Hideout

The Redbrands' base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding holding cells, workshops, and barracks.

If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the hideout in area R1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the hideout via area R8.

### General Features

The hideout consists of well-built chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.

#### Ceilings

Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.

#### Doors

All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. Doors are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. Glasstaff (area R12) and Nosk (area R9) each carry an iron key that locks and unlocks every door in the complex.

A locked door can be picked with [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### Secret Doors

Secret doors are made of stone and blend into the surrounding walls. If an area contains one or more secret doors, a character searching the walls in that area finds its secret doors with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Each search requires 1 minute.

Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.

#### Lights

Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, which are refilled every few hours as needed.

### What the Redbrands Know

If the characters charm or successfully question any of the Redbrands, they can learn the location of the main entrance to their hideout (area R1) as well as the following information:

- **Glasstaff.** The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass. (Only the Spider knows Glasstaff's true identity as Iarno Albrek.) Glasstaff's chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see area R12).  
- **The Spider.** A mysterious figure called the Spider hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. (The Spider wants to keep potential competition away from the Phandelver mine.) The Spider sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see area R9).  
- **Complex Guardian.** The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous "eye monster" (see area R8).  
- **Prisoners.** The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area "near the old crypts," which are guarded by skeletons (see area R4 for details).  

### Redbrand Hideout Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2.2: Redbrand Hideout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/027-map-2-02-redbrand-hideout.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/028-map-2-02-redbrand-hideout-player.webp#gallery)

#### R1: Cellar

The deserted manor grounds have plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.

When the characters open the door, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing that is fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.
^094

The Redbrands want to keep their base of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this cellar gives away their presence.

The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a noisy activity that attracts the attention of the Redbrands in area R2.

##### Cistern

This rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water. It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor). Drainpipes from the roof of the manor fill the cistern with water.

A waterproof satchel hangs from a submerged rope attached to the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below water's surface. The satchel can't be seen from above the water, but a character can probe the cistern with a pole or jump in to find it. The satchel contains some valuable items (see "Treasure" below).

##### Development

The bandits in area R2 notice if the characters make a lot of noise here. They burst into the room, gaining surprised if the characters don't know they're coming.

If the bandits fight in this area and two are defeated, the last bandit might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.

##### Treasure

The waterproof satchel hidden in the cistern contains a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md), a [potion of invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invisibility.md), 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary [travel clothing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/travelers-clothes.md). This is Glasstaff's emergency kit.

#### R2: Barrack

Most of the Redbrands' human members have lodgings in boarding houses and bunk rooms in Phandalin. This barrack is a good place to lie low after they shakedown local miners and fur traders.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small storeroom has been converted into living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the wall near the door, while more barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber. Three humans look up as you open the door.
^099

Three human [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md), all members of the Redbrands, are resting in this room. If they hear noise in area R1 (including loud voices or barrels being rolled around), they prepare themselves for a fight and try to surprise intruders.

The barrels here contain similar provisions to those in area R1.

##### Treasure

All three Redbrands wear [belt pouches](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) holding treasure. The first holds 16 sp and 7 gp; the second holds 12 sp and 5 gp; and the third holds 20 cp, 11 ep, and two garnets worth 10 gp each. Additionally, three dirty scarlet cloaks that are the Redbrands' uniform hang from the bunks.

#### R3: Trapped Hall

This area was part of Tresendar Manor's original cellars. The Redbrands dug out the dirt beneath the stone floor, creating a hidden pit trap.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Thick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway. The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double door at the west end of the hall is sheathed in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a mournful angel adorns the door.
^09c

##### Trap

The pit trap in the middle of the hallway is hidden under a false floor consisting of loose stone tiles laid atop breakaway timbers. The tiles and timbers collapse under 100 or more pounds of weight. A character searching the hall for traps can spot the covered pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. A successful check also reveals narrow ledges on the north and south sides of the pit. A creature attempting to skirt the pit using one of these ledges must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

A creature that triggers the trap or fails the Dexterity check to skirt the edge of the pit must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 20 feet to the dirt floor of the pit, taking `2d6` bludgeoning damage and landing with the [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition.

#### R4: Tresendar Crypts

The elders of the long-gone Tresendar family were laid to rest in this mausoleum.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three large stone sarcophagi stand within this desolate crypt, and six skeletons in rusty mail are propped against the walls as if guarding the place. False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees. The double door in the southeast corner is sheathed in tarnished copper plate.
^09f

The six [skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) are animated and under orders to attack any creature that comes within 10 feet of the door leading to area R5 or the door leading to area R6. They don't attack a creature wearing the scarlet cloak of the Redbrands or that speaks the password "Illefarn" (the name of an ancient elven nation that once spread across much of the Sword Coast).

The stone lid of each sarcophagus is carved to depict the person entombed within: two human men and one human woman, all dressed like nobles. If opened, the tombs contain mostly moldering bones and scraps of clothing, but see "Treasure" below.

##### Development

Fighting in this room alerts the Redbrands in area R5 that trouble is on the way.

##### Treasure

A jeweled gold bracelet worth 140 gp lies amid the bones in the sarcophagus containing the female human remains.

![The long-abandoned crypts ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/029-02-009-tresendar-skeletons.webp#center "The long-abandoned crypts of Tresendar Manor now hold some deadly surprises")

#### R5: Holding Cells

For months, the Redbrands have been capturing travelers in the area and holding them until they can be ransomed.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south. Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks. A pair of human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north.
^0a3

Three [Redbrand ruffians](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/redbrand-ruffian-pabtso.md) stand guard here, though they spend most of their time taunting the hapless prisoners (see "Captives" below). If they hear fighting in area R4, they take positions against the wall near the door, then try to surprise intruders. The captives are too intimidated to shout warnings or call for help.

##### Cell Doors

The cell doors feature simple locks requiring [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to pick. The doors can also be wrenched open by brute force with a successful DC 22 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

##### Development

If two ruffians are defeated, the third tries to flee and warn the rest of the complex. He might reveal the secret door leading into area R7 in his effort to escape.

##### Captives

The three human [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) imprisoned here are Mirna Dendrar and her teenage children, thirteen-year-old Nars and eighteen-year-old Nilsa. A couple days ago, the Redbrands murdered Mirna's husband, Thel. (His corpse can be found in area R8.) The gang was then going to kill his family, but Mirna promised that wealthy relatives in Neverwinter would pay a substantial sum for her and her children's safe return. The Redbrands have kept the Dendrars here while they develop a ransom plan.

The Dendrars are grateful to the characters for rescuing them, but they can't provide much information about the hideout. All they know is that the boss is a wizard (though they haven't met him and don't know his name), and that he has "tall, furry monsters with big ears" (bugbears) working for him.

##### Mirna's Heirloom

Though she has nothing immediately to offer as a reward, Mirna tells the characters that she might know where a valuable heirloom is hidden. When she was a young girl, she and her family fled from the town of Thundertree after undead overran the place. Her family had an herb and alchemy shop, inside which is an emerald necklace in a case hidden beneath a section of storage shelves. She never dared return to retrieve it. The shop was in the southeast part of Thundertree. (If the characters decide to explore the ruins of Thundertree, see chapter 3.)

#### R6: Armory

The door to this room is locked from the outside. Across from the locked door is a secret door that leads to area R7.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Racks of weapons line the walls of this chamber, including spears, swords, crossbows, and bolts. A dozen dirty red cloaks hang from hooks by the door.
^0a9

The Redbrands have ambitious plans to expand their numbers in the near future, so they've been stockpiling arms and armor.

##### Treasure

The weapon racks hold twelve [spears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spear.md), six [shortswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md), four [longswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md), six [light crossbows](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/light-crossbow.md), and eight [quivers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quiver.md) holding twenty [crossbow bolts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/crossbow-bolts-20.md) each. Three of the weapons are especially well made: a shortsword whose pommel and guard are set with semiprecious stones, and two matched crossbows whose woodwork is inlaid with silver. If sold, these weapons fetch twice their normal value.

#### R7: Storeroom and Work Area

In this chamber, the Redbrands take stock of their stolen wares, either shipping them out through the cavern to the south or packaging them for storage in the stronghold.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This area is the north end of a large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.
> 
> The cavern continues for some distance to the south. You can make out several passages that open off the larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.
^0ac

This room contains two secret doors, one leading to area R6 and the other to area R12.

##### Treasure

Most of the provisions and goods here aren't terribly valuable. Forty beaver pelts worth 2 gp each are an exception. They were looted from a caravan on the Triboar Trail a few days ago.

#### R8: Crevasse Cave

The characters likely arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from area R1; the storeroom at area R7; or the rough-hewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a cave in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The southern passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin. If the characters spoke to Carp Alderleaf (see the "Alderleaf Farm" section), he will lead them to the tunnel entrance but won't follow them inside.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A cold breeze softly sighs in this large natural cavern, carrying the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse with sloped walls divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched, wooden bridges span the chasm.
^0af

A subterranean monster that hungers for flesh—a [nothic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md) named Ssarnak—guards this cave. Lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, the creature was occupying the area when Glasstaff moved in. Glasstaff struck a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Ssarnak is untrustworthy but loyal enough, for the moment.

Ssarnak normally lurks near the west ends of the two bridges. If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight to discern the intruders' secrets.

Ssarnak communicates via telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and will betray the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know (see the "What the Redbrands Know" section).

![Ssarnak](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/030-02-010-ssarnak.webp#center)

##### Bridges

These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The southern bridge is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it. A character next to the bridge can spot the rigged construction with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Any creature, including Ssarnak, can dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into the crevasse, as an action. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage, has the [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition, and lands in a jumble of rubble that counts as "difficult terrain".

##### Dead Goblins

Underneath the southern bridge are corpses of two psionic goblins. These goblins have elongated skulls and are dressed in filthy, haphazard rags. An examination of the bodies reveals that a pair of vicious claws killed the goblins.

While they were looking to sow mayhem in the hideout, the goblins fell to the nothic before they could get any farther. It's clear that these goblins are different than the ones the characters encountered in chapter 1. The characters will learn more about these goblins in later chapters.

##### Crevasse

This steep-sided fissure is 5 to 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Its rough walls are easily climbed without a check.

The bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.

Heaped at the bottom is the skeleton of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands. Ssarnak has picked the bones clean, but the body is wearing a carved wooden pendant shaped like a unicorn's head. Mirna Dendrar in area R5 of the Redbrand hideout can identify the pendant and body as her husband's.

##### Treasure

The nothic keeps its hoard in a battered wooden chest hidden in a cubbyhole at the bottom of the crevasse, under the northern bridge. The chest can't be seen from the edge of the crevasse but is obvious to any character who descends into the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems worth 12 gp each, a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md), a [potion of climbing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-climbing.md), and a [potion of growth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-growth.md).

The chest also holds a [+1 longsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) in a dusty silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name "Talon," and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.

Sir Aldith died fighting off the bandits that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor. Talon was lost here until Ssarnak found it.

#### R9: Guard Barrack

A character who listens at this door and succeeds on DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears several gruff voices issuing commands in the Goblin tongue. Even if the character doesn't speak Goblin, it's clear the commands are cruel.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This barrack contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air. Four tall, furry humanoids are lounging in the mess, barking orders at a goblin. Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.
^0b5

Four [bugbears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) and one [goblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) are present. The goblin, Droop, is at the bugbears' mercy. He faints at the sight of the party, but another creature can use an action to wake him. Otherwise, Droop has the [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) condition for `1d10` minutes.

The bugbears work for the Spider and were sent here to help Glasstaff keep the Redbrands and the citizens of Phandalin in line. The leader of the group is named Nosk.

The bugbears are the only ones in the Redbrands' hideout who know the location of Wave Echo Cave. They won't willingly divulge this information, since they fear the Spider more than they fear the characters, though a [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md) spell might coax the information from one of them.

The bugbears also know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but again, they won't share this information willingly.

The bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks, the bugbears assume they serve Glasstaff. Clever characters might even persuade the bugbears to help deal with "traitors" or "impostors" elsewhere in the dungeon.

##### Roleplaying Droop

The goblin, Droop, is not a threat to the party. He is a member of the Scraptops, a goblin clan known for its scavenging and tinkering. Droop wandered into the hideout looking for parts for a wagon he's repairing back home. The Cragmaws are demanding he join their band, but the terrified Droop just wants to go home. When combat breaks out, Droop hides and avoids the fight.

Droop knows the general layout of the Redbrands' hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. If asked, he reveals as much as he can remember.

If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop asks the party to protect him while he escapes the hideout. He doesn't remember the location of Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it's up north (in the forest).

##### Treasure

Nosk carries a [belt pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing 13 sp and some semiprecious stones worth 50 gp. He also has an iron key that locks and unlocks all the doors in the Redbrands' hideout.

![The Cragmaw goblins are a ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/031-02-011-cragmaw-goblins.webp#center "The Cragmaw goblins are a threat throughout the Phandalin region")

#### R10: Common Room

This room is the headquarters and meeting room for the Redbrands. When there is no official business to discuss, it doubles as a common room where the stronghold guards can relax while off duty.

A character who listens at the door and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears the villains playing a game of knucklebones. Rattling sounds are followed by shouts and groans, and then a gabble of voices as wagers are paid. If the characters burst into the room, they surprise its occupants.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room. Wooden benches are drawn against walls decorated with brown-and-red draperies, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.
> 
> Four tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them.
^0b9

Two [Redbrand ruffians](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/redbrand-ruffian-pabtso.md) and two human [bandits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md), all members of the Redbrands, are playing knucklebones when the characters enter. The game isn't far from turning acrimonious. The dice are loaded, and the bandit to which they belong is winning big. All four are intoxicated.

The Redbrands recognize characters wearing scarlet cloaks as impostors. However, fast-talking characters might pass themselves off as new recruits, especially if they offer to join the game.

##### Treasure

The wealth in the room is all on the table, having been bet in the game. (Knocking over the table or mixing up all the enemies' loot is a great way to distract them for a short time.) The total amounts to 75 cp, 55 sp, 22 ep, 15 gp, and a gold earring set with a tiny ruby worth 30 gp.

#### R11: Wizard's Workshop

Faint bubbling and dripping sounds can be heard through either door of this room with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room appears to be a wizard's workshop. A large worktable is set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of them stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes.
^0bc

Though Glasstaff is in his quarters (area R12), he hasn't left his experiments untended. His evil familiar, a [quasit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) named [Zeond](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zeond-pabtso.md), lurks here and watches over its master's work.

[Zeond](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zeond-pabtso.md) is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) when the party enters and doesn't attack immediately. Rather, it watches the party closely and waits until the characters are embroiled in a battle before attacking. After it attacks, [Zeond](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zeond-pabtso.md) turns [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) again and skulks about, looking for a chance to inflict harm upon a weakened character. The quasit doesn't want to find itself the target of multiple enemies.

If [Zeond](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zeond-pabtso.md) follows the party to other locations within the hideout, assume that it can do so without being detected as long as it remains [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible).

##### Books and Notes

Glasstaff is a wizard of middling skill, and he is trying to master the art of brewing potions and concocting useful alchemical mixtures. The books and notes scattered around the room are basic texts on alchemy. Any character proficient in [Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [alchemist's supplies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies.md) can tell the apparatus is set up to brew a [potion of invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invisibility.md)—but the process has been unsuccessful so far.

Among the books is a tome written in Dwarvish. The journal of an adventurer named Urmon, it describes the history of the lost mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells. (Share the information in the first and second paragraph of the beginning of chapter 1 if you haven't already done so.)

In addition, Urmon records that a magic mace named [Lightbringer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/lightbringer-pabtso.md) was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver Pact. The mace was lost when Wave Echo Cave and its mine vanished from history. (Characters might find the mace in chapter 4.)

##### Development

Because [Zeond](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zeond-pabtso.md) and Glasstaff share a telepathic bond, Glasstaff (in area R12) knows the characters are coming and has time to prepare for them.

##### Treasure

Most of the materials in this room have no value, but three bottles hold rare reagents: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. These are worth 25 gp each to an apothecary or alchemist.

#### R12: Glasstaff's Quarters

If the characters approach this room through the secret passage from area R7, they can surprise the leader of the Redbrands, [Iarno "Glasstaff" Albrek](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/iarno-glasstaff-albrek-pabtso.md). Otherwise, his quasit familiar warns him of any who approach through area R11, and Glasstaff flees before the characters arrive. When the characters reach this room, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this bedchamber are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed.
^0c1

If Glasstaff is surprised, add:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sitting at the desk is a short, dark-bearded human man in robes, studying a tome. He wears a princely mantle of ermine, and his boots, gloves, and robes are trimmed in the same fur. A dusky glass staff leans against his chair, within easy reach. Etched into the staff's length are stylized feathers.
^0c2

![Iarno &quot;Glasstaff&quot; Albrek](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/032-02-012-iarno-glasstaff-albrek.webp#center)

If the quasit in area R11 warns Glasstaff that trouble is approaching, he grabs the scrolls from his chest (see "Treasure" below) and flees via a secret door in the northeast corner of the room. In his haste, Glasstaff leaves behind a letter from the Spider (see "Development" below) and neglects to properly close the secret door. Characters gain advantage on ability checks made to find the slightly ajar secret door.

If he manages to escape, Glasstaff flees to area R1 (via areas R7 and R8) and grabs the satchel hidden in the cistern if it is still there. If the nothic is still alive in area R8, Glasstaff instructs it to waylay any pursuers. If the characters catch up to Glasstaff, and he has the satchel, he quaffs the [potion of invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invisibility.md) and flees the hideout.

If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Glasstaff surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and "arrange for his freedom."

##### Roleplaying Glasstaff

A former member of the Lords' Alliance, Glasstaff seized an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, he instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.

Glasstaff knew of the Spider through his contacts in the Lords' Alliance and brokered a meeting. The Spider promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with Glasstaff in exchange for his help and his loyalty.

Glasstaff puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his bandits and ruffians as "my good fellows," and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as "that unpleasant little business" or "those unfortunate events." He may refer to the characters as his "honored guests," and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for the occasion of their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Glasstaff is just as violent and arrogant as any of the Redbrands.

If he is questioned while in captivity, Glasstaff relates the following information, all of which is true:

- **Drow Villain.** The Spider is a drow.  
- **Fearsome Brigands.** The Spider sent four bugbears to help Glasstaff keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have so far managed without them.  
- **Known Route.** The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave. (Glasstaff does not know the route.)  
- **Magical Forge.** The Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells, a magical forge that was used by dwarves and gnomes in bygone days to fashion powerful magic items.  
- **Unknown Betrayal.** No other members of the Lords' Alliance know of Glasstaff's betrayal.  

##### Development

Various papers and notes are stacked neatly on the desk, mostly consisting of Glasstaff's written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop. However, the characters also find a letter rolled up and sealed with a wax symbol in the shape of a spider.

##### Treasure

At the foot of the bed is a sturdy, unlocked wooden chest holding the best pickings of the Redbrands' loot over the last few months. It contains 180 sp, 130 gp, and a silk [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) with five carnelians worth 10 gp each and two peridots worth 15 gp each. It also contains two scrolls that Glasstaff brought with him from Neverwinter: a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-2nd-level.md) of [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md) and a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-3rd-level.md) of [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md).

Glasstaff also wields a [staff of defense](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff-of-defense-pabtso.md).

## What's Next?

If Glasstaff is taken into custody, [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster's hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. At some point, Glasstaff stands trial for his crimes. If your players are interested, consider running a short roleplaying scene in which their characters give testimony about Glasstaff's actions and what the party found in the Redbrands' hideout. Or you can skip the trial, as its details are immaterial to this adventure. Once Glasstaff is found guilty, Sildar takes him to Neverwinter, where he serves his lengthy prison sentence. The Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard's fate, so Glasstaff can forgo any hope of a rescue.

At this point, it should be clear to the characters that they must find Wave Echo Cave in the wilds outside Phandalin.

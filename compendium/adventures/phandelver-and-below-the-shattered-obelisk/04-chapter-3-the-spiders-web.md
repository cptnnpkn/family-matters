# Chapter 3: The Spider's Web
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk, p. 47* 

Once the characters have dealt with Iarno "Glasstaff" Albrek, they'll likely want to find Wave Echo Cave and confront the Spider. So far, the characters haven't learned the cave's location, but they have several leads that point to the wilderness outside Phandalin. The characters may also complete any quests they received from townspeople in Phandalin.

The characters can't learn much more in town, and with the Redbrands defeated, Phandalin isn't in immediate danger. The heroes must enter the forests and hills surrounding the town to uncover the larger plots they're caught in.

![The banshee Agatha brooks ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/034-03-001-ch3-splash.webp#center "The banshee Agatha brooks no disrespect or threats in her home")

## The Story So Far

Depending on which townspeople the characters met in Phandalin and which quests they completed or clues they gathered, they might know some or all the following information:

- **The Banshee.** Sister Garaele wants the characters to find the banshee Agatha and ask her about Bowgentle's spellbook (see "Conyberry and Agatha's Lair").  
- **Old Owl Well.** Daran Edermath wants the characters to discover who is exploring the ruins at Old Owl Well (see "Old Owl Well").  
- **Thundertree.** Qelline Alderleaf suggested the characters go to the ruined town of Thundertree and consult with the druid Reidoth (see "Ruins of Thundertree").  
- **Wyvern Tor.** Townmaster Harbin Wester wants the characters to head east on the Triboar Trail and chase away raiders near Wyvern Tor (see "Wyvern Tor").  
- **Cragmaw Castle.** [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md) wants the characters to stop the Cragmaw goblins' attacks and search for [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md), and he encourages them to explore Cragmaw Castle (see "Cragmaw Castle").  

The characters can rest and purchase supplies in Phandalin as their funds allow. When they're done, ask the players to pick a lead to investigate so their characters can head to the appropriate destination.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter takes place in the wilds surrounding Phandalin, a region known as the Triboar Trail. The area is composed of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded plains that extend between the Sword Mountains to the south and Neverwinter Wood to the north. The area gains its name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High Road along the coast.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 3rd level when the chapter begins. The characters gain a level when they confront King Grol and learn the location of the lost mine of Phandelver.

### Using the Overland Map

In this chapter, the characters travel from one point of interest to another. As shown on the regional map in this book's introduction, some of these areas are forty to fifty miles apart, requiring several days of marching overland to reach the next adventure site.

#### Travel Time

Assume the party travels twenty-four miles per day over a period of ten hours. The characters must rest for eight hours per day, with the remaining six hours available for making and breaking camp, preparing meals, and foraging or hunting.

### Wilderness Encounters

![The Triboar Trail is full ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/035-03-002-triboar-trail.webp#center "The Triboar Trail is full of dangers, including hungry owlbears")

The wilds of the Triboar Trail are not especially safe. As the heroes travel throughout this area, they might stumble across hungry animals, greedy bandits, or vicious monsters.

Check for random wilderness encounters once during the day and once at night by rolling a `d20`. On a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place. Roll a `d12` and consult the Triboar Trails Random Encounters table to determine what the party meets.

#### Cragmaw Goblin Band

This band of Cragmaw marauders consists of `2d4` [goblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) led by a [goblin boss](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-boss.md). They know the location of Cragmaw Castle and can provide directions if they are captured and threatened. The boss has a [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing `1d10` cp and `1d10` sp.

#### Hobgoblin Squad

This squad of `1d4 + 3` [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) seeks the adventurers, hoping to collect a bounty set by the Spider. One of the hobgoblins carries a crudely drawn sketch of one party member, with "25 gold pieces for this one" and a symbol of a spider scrawled beneath it.

#### Bugbear Scouts

These two [bugbears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) are part of the band based at Wyvern Tor. As they roam, they look for travelers to ambush.

## Conyberry and Agatha's Lair

The town of Conyberry has been abandoned for years and lies in ruins. The Triboar Trail runs through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha's lair is a few miles outside town.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. After rounding a bend in the trail, you come upon a domed shelter made from the warped, bowing branches of nearby trees. A low doorway leads inside.
^0d3

This 10-foot-by-10-foot shelter is the lair of Agatha the [banshee](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/banshee.md). If the characters exercise caution and remember what they've come here for, they won't have to fight her. As such, no map is provided. If a fight breaks out, any forest map with a small structure will do.

When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, a table, and a chaise longue, all of it old and of elven craft.
^0d4

Agatha senses the characters' intrusion and appears shortly after they enter her home:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. A hateful expression twists her features.
^0d5

Agatha snarls:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Foolish mortals. What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?"
^0d6

If the characters are rude, disrespectful, or threatening, Agatha tries to frighten them away using her Horrifying Visage ability. If that isn't enough to deter them, she attacks.

### Dealing with the Banshee

If the characters are respectful and polite, they can persuade Agatha to help them with a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

The player who takes the lead in speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player roleplays the encounter well, allow them to make the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele's silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift, the check is automatically successful. If the check fails, Agatha attacks the characters; if it succeeds, she smiles with cold amusement and entertains their questions:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Very well. I know that you seek many things. Ask me one question, and I will give you an answer."
^0d8

If the characters ask about Bowgentle's spellbook, Agatha tells them that she traded the book to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago. She doesn't know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it's all the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.

The characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else—for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Spider, or Hamun Kost's question about Old Owl Well (see that section, below). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the players think to have their characters ask. However, the banshee warns the characters that she will answer only one question, so they should choose it carefully.

### Sister Garaele's Quest

Learning what Agatha knows about the missing spellbook completes a quest given to the party by Sister Garaele in Phandalin. The characters should report to Sister Garaele to receive their payment of three [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md).

## Old Owl Well

Built thousands of years ago by a long-vanished empire, Old Owl Well is now a ruined watchtower, along with an adjoining building, that consists of little more than a few crumbling walls and the broken stump of the tower. In the tower's courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water.

Old Owl Well lies eighteen miles southeast of Conyberry, in the hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to the ruins.

Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well, and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out. The ruins are currently occupied by a wizard who is exploring the site in the hope of gleaning arcane lore left by its builders.

If the characters approach Old Owl Well, read the following aloud:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower and mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard amid the rugged hills. A colorful tent sits in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.
^0db

Old Owl Well is shown on map 3.1. The characters can enter the site from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap in the surrounding walls of rubble.

![Map 3.1: Old Owl Well](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/036-03-003-map301-old-owl-well.webp#center)

Twelve [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) lurk inside the crumbled shell of the old watchtower and can't be seen from outside. However, any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check smells a deathly odor wafting from the tower's direction.

When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble from the tower. If a battle breaks out, Hamun Kost, a human [mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), emerges from his tent and asks, "What is the meaning of this?"

Hamun is a Red Wizard—a spellcaster from a land called Thay, far to the east. His is a red-robed figure with a shaved scalp and a tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes Hamun's tattoo as a necromantic symbol. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check verifies the wizard's garb as belonging to Thay, a land of necromancers where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard's school of magic specialty, Hamun's being necromancy.

If any character attempts to talk to Hamun, even by calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the same time it helps the characters.

Hamun stays tight-lipped about the reason for his presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide the information the party needs in exchange for a favor. If the characters give Hamun some indication of what they might want (for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave), he shares one or both requests:

- He wants the marauders at Wyvern Tor to leave; they've scouted out his camp and seem inclined to cause trouble.  
- He wants to ask Agatha the banshee the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well. Hamun won't risk the banshee's anger, but the characters could ask the question for him. (Agatha knows the name: Dresina.)  

### Treasure

Hamun's tent contains a comfortable traveling suite: a cot, a chair, a writing desk, supplies, and a chest of clothes. In the chest is a leather bag containing 35 sp, 20 ep, 20 gp, and 5 pp; five small agates worth 10 gp each; a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) and a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-2nd-level.md) of [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md) in a bone tube; and a Tiny jeweled box worth 25 gp.

The jeweled box contains the Red Wizard's most interesting discovery so far: a [ring of protection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/netherese-ring-of-protection-pabtso.md) from ancient Netheril. The ring is made from a single piece of mystical green glass that's stronger than steel. It has the added property of making the wearer less likely to drop or lose anything held in the hand the ring is on. The wearer receives a +4 bonus to saving throws or checks made to avoid dropping or being disarmed of any item held in that hand.

### Daran Edermath's Quest

Learning about the Red Wizard's presence at Old Owl Well completes a quest given to the party by Daran Edermath in Phandalin. The characters should meet with Daran in Phandalin to receive their reward of [boots of striding and springing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/boots-of-striding-and-springing.md).

## Ruins of Thundertree

Near the place where the Neverwinter River emerges from Neverwinter Wood stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. It was once a prosperous community, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.

Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long—with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area U4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Some cultists also arrived recently (see area U13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see area U7).

As the party approaches the ruined settlement, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked with vines and brush. In the middle of the settlement rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins. Other buildings appear intact. The whole place is eerily silent.
> 
> A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: "Danger! Plant monsters and zombies! Turn back now!"
^0df

Reidoth placed the sign to discourage treasure seekers from stirring up the monsters in the area.

### General Features

Many of Thundertree's buildings have crumbled in the years since the town was abandoned, and nature threatens to swallow what remains.

#### Buildings

A building in Thundertree is either ruined or intact, as shown on map 3.2.

Ruined buildings are empty shells with stone walls 5 to 8 feet high. Their roofs are gone, leaving piles of debris inside the walls. The debris is "difficult terrain".

Intact buildings are rundown, ramshackle stone cottages that are otherwise still standing. Their wooden doors are stuck and require a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The windows of any intact building are 2 feet wide and covered by wooden shutters containing 6-inch-wide arrow slits. Creatures on one side of an arrow slit gain "three-quarters cover" against attacks from the other side. Dusty furnishings, such as simple wooden chairs and tables, remain in most intact buildings.

#### Trees and Brush

Trees average 30 to 40 feet tall and provide cover. Brush consists of sprawling bushes that count as "difficult terrain".

### Ruins Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 3.2: Ruins of Thundertree](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/037-map-3-02-ruins-of-thundertree.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/038-map-3-02-ruins-of-thundertree-player.webp#gallery)

#### U1: Westernmost Cottage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Cowering in the shadow of an old tree is a crumbled, weed-choked stone cottage with no roof.
^0e5

Two [twig blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md) hide among the weeds that flank the cottage's open doorway. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher spot the blights from up to 10 feet away. Alternatively, a character within 10 feet of the doorway can look for signs of danger and make a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, spotting the blights on a successful check.

The blights remain perfectly still. They don't attack on their own (except in self-defense) but quickly come to the aid of the twig blights in area U2 if combat erupts there.

#### U2: Blighted Cottages

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> These ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time. All that remains are collapsed walls and piles of debris. Several young trees have grown within the ruins.
^0e7

The overgrowth conceals a deadly threat: two [twig blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md) lurking in the foliage. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher spot the blights from up to 10 feet away. Alternatively, a character within 10 feet of the doorway can look for signs of danger and make a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, spotting the blights on a successful check.

These plant monsters are hungry and fight until destroyed. One round after these blights attack, the [twig blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md) in area U1 join the fray.

##### Treasure

A merchant who once lived here hid a chest under the flagstone floor. A thorough search of the interior of the eastern cottage and a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals the old chest among the roots of a tree growing in the house. The chest contains 1,400 cp, 160 sp, and 90 gp.

#### U3: The Brown Horse

This was formerly the Brown Horse, a taproom renowned for its excellent ale.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A weathered signboard by the door of this large building shows the faded image of a workhorse holding a flagon of ale. The building is sagging and dilapidated, but it is more intact than the ruins across the road.
^0ea

Six ash [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (see the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) lurk in the shadows in this building, slumped against the walls or under the bar. When living creatures enter, the zombies groan and stir, slowly climbing to their feet. They pursue any characters they see, attacking until destroyed.

The eastern half of the building was the old common room, while the western portion held the kitchens and the brewer's vats. Huge wooden tuns stand to the west, and a faint smell of yeast still permeates the air. The ale is long gone.

> [!note] 
> 
> Ash Zombies
> 
> These zombies were created by the magical devastation when Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago. They use the [zombie](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) stat block. When they die, they leave a cloud of ash that lasts for 5 minutes but does not obscure vision.
^0eb

#### U4: Druid's Watch Post

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small house is in better condition than the dilapidated structures nearby. The doors are reinforced with heavy iron bands, and thick shutters protect the windows.
^0ed

![Reidoth the Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/039-03-004-reidoth-the-druid.webp#center)

This is where Reidoth makes camp when she visits Thundertree. Reidoth is an elderly human woman with long, white hair who doesn't use two words when one word will do. Though she doesn't receive many visitors, she is reasonably hospitable.

Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area's mutated plants. She knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and she suspects that miscreants have a hideout on the eastern side of town—she's seen "people in black masks and cloaks" (the cultists) skulking around. However, she is most concerned that a young green dragon has moved into the tower (area U7) since the last time she was here. She warns the characters of all these threats and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they're killed.

![Emerald Enclave Pin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/040-03-005-emerald-enclave-pin.webp#center)

##### Development

If the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth hesitates to provide directions. She is a member of the Emerald Enclave, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out unnatural threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. As such, Reidoth doesn't want to rile the goblins without good cause. If any of the characters appear to respect her position and beliefs, the druid tells them where to find the goblin stronghold. Otherwise, Reidoth offers a bargain: if the characters chase off Venomfang the dragon in area U7, she'll provide directions.

If the characters attack her for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries from the cottage through a crack in the wall. She hides in the woods until the characters leave. Her watch post contains nothing of value.

> [!note] 
> 
> Joining the Emerald Enclave
> 
> If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Emerald Enclave. She speaks with those who exemplify the ideal of protecting the natural order. If a character agrees, Reidoth gives the individual the title of "Springwarden." This rank and faction won't affect this adventure, but it is significant for players who participate in Organized Play events.
^0ef

#### U5: Blighted Farmhouse

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This ruin looks as if it might once have been a farmhouse. It is now half swallowed by a dense thicket, with trees growing through its foundations. The lane continues south a short distance past the ruin before ending in an overgrown field.
^0f1

The thicket east of this ruin is crawling with twelve [twig blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md) and two [needle blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/needle-blight.md). Any disturbance in the ruined farmhouse (for example, characters rooting around in the rubble) draws the blights' ire.

Each round for 3 rounds, two of the twig blights head for the south doorway while two more head for the north doorway. The needle blights follow on round 3, each one moving toward a different doorway. The blights are fearless and attack until destroyed.

#### U6: Ruined Store

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At an intersection near the middle of the village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might've been a store or workshop. Webs stretch across the lane, from the building to the trees on the north side of the road.
^0f3

This former general store isn't a complete ruin yet; portions of its tile roof remain intact.

Two [giant spiders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) lurk in the building, hiding behind the walls. Thin, trailing lines from the webs in the lane outside allow the spiders to sense when likely prey moves through the webs, at which point they nimbly scuttle over the wall and attack. Allow characters who alert the spiders to make a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to avoid being surprised.

##### Webs

The webs are "difficult terrain", and a creature trying to move through them must succeed on a DC 8 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or have the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition as the webs snare it. A [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can take an action each round to make a DC 8 Strength check to break free, or it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that deals slashing damage. The webs have AC 10 and have 10 hit points and vulnerability to fire damage.

Going around the webs is difficult because of the thickets on the north side of the road. Going around the building to the south leads to the twig blights in area U5.

##### Treasure

The corpse of an unfortunate adventurer lies cocooned in spider silk in the western half of the building. The body is shriveled and dry, but it appears to have been a male elf. The corpse wears [+1 leather armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-armor.md) and a [shortsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md) in the scabbard at its hip. A careful search also yields a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) in a [belt pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md), along with 23 gp and 35 sp.

#### U7: Old Tower

![A formidable green dragon ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/041-03-006-venomfang-in-tower.webp#center "A formidable green dragon named Venomfang has found a new lair")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in relatively good condition, although half of the tower's roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air.
> 
> The corpses of two giant spiders sprawl near the edge of the pathway, apparently dragged there. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.
^0f7

This tower was formerly the home of a human wizard, who was killed fighting the ash zombies that overran Thundertree thirty years ago.

A [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md) named Venomfang recently claimed the tower, having passed over Thundertree while searching Neverwinter Wood for a suitable lair. The giant spider corpses in the clearing are the former residents of the tower, killed by the dragon after Venomfang tore through the roof. Since then, the dragon has been laying low.

##### Tower

The dragon lives in the tower—a single large room with the remains of a 40-foot-high ceiling. A 5-foot-wide staircase circles the interior, rising to the now-opened rooftop that allows the dragon easy access to its new home. Heavy wooden beams and stair supports crisscross the tower interior.

Venomfang doesn't want to give up such a promising lair, but if the characters reduce the dragon to one-quarter of its hit points, Venomfang climbs to the top of the tower and flies off.

##### Cottage

The cottage contains dusty furniture draped in webbing, but nothing of value. If the characters make a lot of noise in the cottage, the dragon hears them and prepares for a fight.

##### Treasure

A broken, old wooden chest on the tower floor holds the last of the dead wizard's treasure: 2,100 cp, 130 gp, four silver goblets set with moonstones worth 60 gp each, a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-2nd-level.md) of [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md), and a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-3rd-level.md) of [lightning bolt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lightning-bolt.md). Venomfang spends hours each day greedily admiring the loot.

The dragon has barely noticed the most interesting item in its hoard. Lying beneath the coins is a rusty old battleaxe of dwarven manufacture. Runes spell out "Hew" in Dwarvish on the axe head and the rust is misleading. [Hew](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hew-pabtso.md) is a [+1 battleaxe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) that deals maximum damage when the wielder attacks a Plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe's creator used it for protection in the forest while he cut firewood.

#### U8: Old Smithy

> [!readaloud]

> Based on its wide chimney and the rotted piles of firewood jumbled outside the walls, this sagging building was probably a smithy in its day.
^0fc

Four ash [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (see the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) are slumped on the floor. When the characters enter, the monsters climb to their feet and lurch forward to attack. Once the zombies see the characters, they pursue the characters relentlessly.

A variety of old tools—tongs, bellows, hammers, and a pair of iron anvils—are scattered around the interior of this building.

##### Treasure

A battered old cabinet is half buried beneath the partially collapsed roof. It contains a large leather satchel filled with strange, diamond-shaped plates of a brown-gold color. Each is about half the size of a human hand, light in weight, and as tough as iron. The plates are brass dragon scales, which can be sold to an armorer or another interested buyer for 75 gp total.

#### U9: Herbalist's Shop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This ruined shop is cluttered with sagging storage shelves and broken furniture. Shards of glass and pieces of pottery glint in the weeds and rubble next to rotted books and casks.
^0ff

This was an herb and alchemy shop belonging to the family of Mirna Dendrar, now a resident in Phandalin (see area R5 in the "Redbrand Hideout Locations" section in chapter 2).

All the reagents and concoctions here have long since spoiled, and the books are unreadable masses of rot. However, a small wooden case is hidden in a compartment beneath the storage shelves. A character searching through the wreckage can find the case with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. The check succeeds automatically if Mirna sent the party to find the heirloom.

##### Treasure

The case is worthless but contains a gold necklace with a fine emerald pendant worth 200 gp.

#### U10: Town Square

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> On the east side of town, the lane opens to form a small square. Several ruined buildings surround the square, but a larger, intact structure to the north looks like a barrack. One lane leads south, another heads southwest around the hill in the middle of the town, and a third way meanders north. In the middle of the square, leaning slightly, is a badly weathered wooden statue of a warrior clutching a spear and shield.
^102

The leaning statue is 10 feet tall, including the base. It depicts an old hero of Neverwinter named Palien, who supposedly defeated several monsters in Neverwinter Wood when Thundertree was first founded. A character who studies the statue recognizes the depiction with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check.

#### U11: Old Garrison

![Strange zombies that spew ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/042-03-007-ash-zombie.webp#center "Strange zombies that spew ash puffs threaten the Triboar Trail region")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The barrack appears to have weathered the years better than most buildings in town. Its rooftop features a simple battlement, and arrow-slit windows indicate that it served as a small keep in times of emergency.
^104

Five ash [zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (see the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) lurk in this building. Former members of the garrison, they still wear the remnants of rusted mail and soldiers' surcoats. These scraps of armor don't improve their Armor Class. The zombies animate and attack if any living creature disturbs their rest.

The interior of the building still contains furnishings, and the main room has a ladder leading through a trapdoor to the roof. The main chamber contains two double bunks, while the chamber to the south has three double bunks, providing quarters for ten soldiers altogether. To the northwest of the main area are a kitchen and pantry, which now contain piles of rotten sacks and barrels that once held salted meat. Vermin have long since devoured all the foodstuffs.

#### U12: Weaver's Cottage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Heaps of wreckage litter the interior of this ruin. In one corner stands a broken loom.
^106

Four [twig blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md) lurk in the thicket south of this ruin, while two [needle blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/needle-blight.md) hide in the trees on the east side of the lane. A character within 10 feet of one or more blights can make a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting the creatures' presence on a successful check. Otherwise, the blights attack if a character comes within 5 feet of them.

##### Development

Any loud noises here alert the cultists in area U13, who cautiously investigate.

#### U13: Dragon Cultists' Cottage

A widespread group called the Cult of the Dragon seeks to forge alliances with powerful dragons of the Sword Coast. Toward that end, four cultists recently tracked the green dragon known as Venomfang to Thundertree (see area U7). The cultists are waiting for the right moment to approach the dragon; they've been spying on the dragon from afar, trying to gauge Venomfang's demeanor and needs.

When the characters approach this area, read the following aloud:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Debris is strewn about the meager yard of this small, dilapidated farmhouse.
^109

The doors to this cottage are barred from the inside, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. The shutters are also barred from inside and can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Six human [cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) hide in the house. Four stand guard at a time (two in each room) on eight-hour shifts, while the others rest in the larger chamber. The cultists wear black cloaks cut to resemble dragon wings and black leather masks with stylized dragon horns. In addition to Common, the cultists speak Draconic.

The interior of the house is dusty and strung with cobwebs. The only furnishings are a small stove, a table, two chairs, and a bunk (which the cultists share).

##### Development

The cultists aren't interested in fighting anyone and prefer to be left alone. The leader is an ambitious young man named Favric, who hopes to rise through the ranks quickly by earning the allegiance of the green dragon in area U7. His fellow cultists don't share Favric's ambition and flee if he's captured or killed.

If the characters talk to the cultists, Favric explains that they've come to treat with the green dragon (whose name he doesn't know). If the characters express a similar desire, Favric suggests an alliance. He actually plans to offer the characters to the dragon as part of his tribute, and if a fight ensues, the cultists side with the dragon against the party in the hope of earning its trust.

##### Treasure

In addition to what he carries, Favric has a small coffer containing tribute for the green dragon: six lustrous amethysts worth 50 gp each. He also carries a [potion of flying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-flying.md) in a stoppered vial around his neck.

## Wyvern Tor

This crag is a prominent landmark in the rugged hills northeast of the Sword Mountains, and it is easily visible from twenty miles away. People traveling along the Triboar Trail in the vicinity of Conyberry catch glimpses of Wyvern Tor to the south as they go. The tor was formerly the home of a large and dangerous nest of wyverns, but a band of bold adventurers dealt with the monsters years ago. Though the wyverns never returned, other creatures lair here from time to time—including a band of orc raiders that set up camp a couple of months ago. Led by an orc named Brughor Axe-Biter, these raiders noticed the Triboar Trail's increase in traffic and have been ambushing travelers and stealing their wares. Recently, strange goblins with elongated skulls have occasionally joined the raiders in their attacks, although the goblins never stick around long enough for the raiders to learn much about them.

### Raider Camp

Wyvern Tor is a sizable hill, with miles of rugged terrain on its flanks and slopes. Searching for the hidden raider camp takes time. The character leading the party can attempt one DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or DC 10 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check per hour to find the camp, made by the character leading the way.

![Map 3.3: Wyvern Tor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/043-03-008-map303-wyvern-tor.webp#center)

The camp is depicted on map 3.3. When the characters find the camp, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The faint smell of smoke hangs in the air as you ascend a rugged ridge on the lower slopes of the hill. Fifty yards away, a cave mouth opens up at the bottom of a ravine. Hunkered down by a boulder twenty yards outside the cave, evidently keeping watch, is a single bugbear.
^10e

If the characters quietly take out the lone [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md), they have a chance to surprised the raiders in the cave. If the sentry spots the characters sneaking up, or if an attack fails to take the sentry out, the sentry shouts a warning and retreats back to the cave, joining the rest of the marauders there.

The marauders in the cave include Brughor Axe-Biter, an [orc](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) with 18 hit points; four [bugbears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md); and an [ogre](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) named Gog. Gog fights until slain, while the rest flee if Brughor is killed.

If the characters examine the cave walls, they find a strange, scrawled drawing on the northwest wall. The drawing crudely depicts a lanky goblin with a crystal jutting from its skull. The characters can tell this isn't a Cragmaw goblin, but they can't learn anything more just yet. Psionic goblins who were off task in their search for obelisk fragments made this drawing. It attempts to depict their leader, Ruxithid, who is described more in chapter 5.

#### Treasure

Brughor's band plundered several homesteads farther north on their way to Wyvern Tor. An unlocked treasure chest in the cave holds 180 sp, 15 ep, and three [vials of perfume](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/perfume-vial.md) worth 5 gp each.

#### Harbin Wester's Quest

Defeating the marauders at Wyvern Tor completes a quest given to the party by Townmaster Harbin Wester in Phandalin, and delivers on a promise to Hamun Kost at Old Owl Well. The characters can report to Harbin Wester to receive their 100 gp reward.

## Cragmaw Castle

The Cragmaw goblins include several marauding bands scattered throughout the Triboar Trail and the Neverwinter Wood region. However, one leader is grudgingly recognized by all others as supreme: King Grol of Cragmaw Castle.

Cragmaw Castle isn't a goblin construction, nor is that the structure's original name. It was built by a talented wizard of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once controlled much of the North. It originally had seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels have long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor remains sound enough to be habitable.

### General Features

The centuries haven't been kind to Cragmaw Castle. The Cragmaw goblins shored up the weakest areas beneath its falling towers with crude timbers, but it's only a matter of time before the structure collapses completely.

#### Doors

Interior doors are made of wood reinforced with iron bands. They have neither locks nor keyholes. It takes a successful DC 15 Strength check to break down a door that is barricaded.

#### Ceilings

Ceilings are 15 feet high unless noted otherwise.

#### Floors

Cracked and uneven flagstones conceal a dirt floor underneath.

#### Light

A small amount of natural light filters through the arrow slits around the castle. During the day, this provides dim light in most areas. At night, all areas of the castle are dark.

#### Walls

The castle's thickest walls are 5 feet thick, with 3 feet of mortared fill sandwiched between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior walls are 1-foot-thick worked stone.

Arrow slits in the castle walls are positioned 10 feet above the ground and 4 feet above the interior floors. A creature on one side of an arrow slit gains "three-quarters cover" against attacks from the other side.

### Cragmaw Castle Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.4.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 3.4: Cragmaw Castle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/044-map-3-04-cragmaw-castle.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/045-map-3-04-cragmaw-castle-player.webp#gallery)

#### C1: Castle Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The castle has seven crumbling towers of different sizes and heights, but the upper stories are all in varying states of collapse. A short flight of steps ascends to a terrace in front of the main entryway. Past the wreckage of a pair of sundered doors lies a shadowed hall. Round towers loom over the entranceway, with arrow slits facing the terrace.
^11b

The main gates between areas C1 and C2 are made of bronze-covered wood, but they are corroded and collapsed. No monsters dwell here, but the goblin sentries in area C3 are supposed to be keeping watch. They glance only occasionally through the arrow slits, however, so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. Have each character make a Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. The lowest check is the DC for the goblins' Wisdom checks to notice the party.

##### Development

If the goblins spot the characters (or if the characters approach openly), the goblins shoot arrows through the arrow slits. However, they can't fire directly at enemies who have reached or gone past the broken gate. The goblins also shout to alert their comrades in areas C4 and C6 that the castle is under attack.

#### C2: Trapped Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Doors stand closed to the north and south, with a crumbling mound of rubble partially obscuring the southern hall. To the east, a broad corridor ends in two more doors leading south and east. The corridor is cluttered with dusty rubble and fallen plaster from a partial collapse of the ceiling.
^11e

If the goblin sentries in area C3 raised the alarm, then the goblins and hobgoblins in areas C4 and C6 run through the north and south doors at the same time. They attack from both directions, trying to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them from the castle.

##### Trap

The dusty plaster and rubble before the door leading to area C8 conceal a copper tripwire connected to linchpins hidden in the ruined ceiling. Spotting the tripwire requires a search of the area and a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Once spotted, the tripwire is easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).

Any creature that walks over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire triggers a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. (The area of the collapse is marked on map 3.4.) Any creature in the area when the trap triggers must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take `2d10` bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble (half as much damage on a successful save). The noise of the collapse puts the creatures in areas C3, C7, C8, and C9 on alert.

#### C3: Archer Post

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small room is littered with debris. The arrow slit opposite the door offers a fine field of fire over the terrace before the castle gates. Two goblins with shortbows stand near the arrow slit.
^121

Cragmaw Castle's main defenses are its secret location and the appearance of having been abandoned. In addition, King Grol posts sentries to drive off intruders who get too close.

Each of these two rooms is occupied by two [goblin bosses](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-boss-archer-pabtso.md) armed with shortbows. Replace the goblin bosses' normal javelin attack with the following attack option:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80 ft./320 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.
^122

The goblins fire each round at targets outside. When characters enter the room, the goblins switch to attacking in melee.

#### C4: Ruined Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The southwest tower of the castle is little more than a heap of rubble. Several ragged bedrolls are scattered across the remaining floor space, and three of the bedrolls have goblins sleeping in them. A small, twisting passage leads east through the ruins.
^125

Three [goblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) bunk here. Though the rubble appears dangerous, the tower is stable and the eastern passage is safe.

##### Development

Any loud noises here attract the attention of the goblins in area C7. One goblin is sent through the twisting passage to investigate the disturbance. If he doesn't return in a round or two, or if he spots trouble and sounds the alarm, the other goblins in area C7 investigate.

#### C5: Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Old casks and sacks of rotting grain fill this storage area, along with a jumbled pile of gear.
^128

Caravans raided by the Cragmaws along the High Road and the Triboar Trail supply provisions for the castle.

##### Emboldening Brandy

While most of the casks are full of salted meat, one small cask is filled with an exceptional dwarven brandy, which the goblins didn't notice because it was mixed in with junk. The cask contains the equivalent of twenty glasses. A character who imbibes a glass of brandy receives 1 "temporary hit point", but a character who drinks two glasses or more within 1 hour has the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition for 1 hour.

##### Sildar's Gear

The equipment piled among the supplies includes a bloody suit of [chain mail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chain-mail.md), a [shortsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md) in a leather scabbard, a [heavy crossbow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/heavy-crossbow.md), and an unsheathed [longsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md) with the emblem of Neverwinter worked into its hilt. The chain mail and weapons belong to [Sildar Hallwinter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-pabtso.md). None of these items is magical, but Sildar is grateful if at least his longsword is returned to him.

#### C6: Hobgoblin Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four plain straw pallets and bedrolls are lined up on the floor of this barrack. Brackets on the walls hold weapons: spears, swords, morningstars, and more. The north wall shows signs of damage, but the floor is swept clean of rubble. Sitting on the bedrolls are four bored, red-skinned Humanoids.
^12c

Four [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) are quartered in this room. Because their goblin neighbors are always getting into fights, they don't pay attention to noise in areas C2 or C3. However, they're quick to defend their tower if any intruders appear, or to respond to an alarm raised by the goblin sentries.

The Cragmaws are a mixed group of goblinoids, with a handful of bugbears lording over larger numbers of miserable goblins and a few hobgoblins. The hobgoblins plan to dispose of the bugbears and take over someday, but for now, the bugbears are too strong a threat.

##### Treasure

Mounted to the walls are five [spears](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spear.md), four [longswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md), three [morningstars](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/morningstar.md), two [greatswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/greatsword.md), and a [quarterstaff](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff.md). None of the weapons is magical, but the quarterstaff is engraved with stylized feathers. The quarterstaff is surprisingly light (1 lb.) and is worth 10 gp for the craftsmanship alone.

#### C7: Banquet Hall

![The goblins who inhabit Cr...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/046-03-009-goblin-dinner-party.webp#center "The goblins who inhabit Cragmaw Castle often hold raucous, messy dinner parties")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The western portion of this large hall ends in a wall of rubble, but the remainder is still intact. This was once the castle's banquet hall, with a soaring ceiling twenty-five feet high. Two large wooden tables with plain benches stand in the middle of the room, and a brass brazier full of glowing coals is tucked into one corner. Dirty dishes, half-full stewpots, moldy heels of bread, and gnawed bones cover the tables. Several goblins scuttle about while a tough-looking goblin barks orders.
^12f

This hall holds six [goblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and one [goblin boss](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-boss.md)—a cantankerous fellow named Yegg. Yegg is the primary cook for the Cragmaws, and he berates his assistants as they go about the work of putting food on the Cragmaws' table. If Yegg is killed, any goblins left alive flee to the east or west, avoiding the north door because of the trap in area C2.

#### C8: Dark Hall

This area has no exterior light. The boxed text assumes that the characters have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) or a light source.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This high, narrow hall looks as if it might've been part of a chapel or shrine at one time. Angelic figures are sculpted along the room's upper reaches, overlooking the floor. To the north, heavy curtains block a matching pair of archways. Between the archways is a cracked but ornately carved stone brazier.
^131

This chamber is home to a [grick](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/grick.md), the special pet of the goblin boss Lhupo in area C9. The grick likes to climb up to ledges hidden in the shadows of the statuary in the higher reaches of the room. It quietly observes intruders that enter the area before dropping down to strike. Characters in the hall must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or be surprised.

The grick knows that goblins are not to be eaten unless Lhupo says so. The rest of the Cragmaws are terrified of the grick and hurry through this room, preferably in twos or threes.

A character who examines the chapel's decor can make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check to identify the deities that were once revered here: Oghma (god of knowledge), Mystra (god of magic), Lathander (god of dawn), and Tymora (god of luck).

##### Development

If combat erupts here, the creatures in area C9 cannot be surprised.

##### Treasure

The stone brazier contains a mound of coal, under which is buried a gold [statuette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/statuette-of-augury-pabtso.md) of an elf worth 100 gp, wrapped in crimson cloth. A goblin hid the figurine here, hoping his fellow goblins wouldn't steal it.

A [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that the statuette is imbued with divination magic. A non-evil creature grasping the statue can ask it a question and receive a telepathic response, as though the creature had cast [augury](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md). Once a creature has asked its question and received a response, it can never activate the statuette again.

#### C9: Goblin Shrine

The Cragmaws have been using this place as a shrine to a made-up god they call the Jagged Tooth.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber occupies the northern tower of the castle. A stone altar stands in the middle of the room, covered with bloodstained black cloth. Gold ritual implements—a chalice and a censer—are carefully arranged atop the altar. Two archways to the south are covered with heavy curtains.
^135

This shrine is home to a [goblin boss](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-boss.md) named Lhupo, who styles herself as a priest, and her "acolytes," a pair of [goblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md). They all wear robes over their armor, but none of them possess divine powers. If the goblins heard the characters fighting the grick in area C8, they hide behind the altar and attempt to surprise the characters; otherwise, all three goblins are kneeling before the altar, praying.

A bloodstained cloth covers the stone altar, the sides of which are engraved with images of the same gods reflected in the decor found in area C8.

##### Treasure

The chalice and censer are art objects worth 180 gp and 150 gp, respectively. Lhupo decided the items were of suitable quality for her unnamed rituals.

#### C10: Postern Gate

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> On the south side of the old castle, an overgrown path leads to a passage that climbs into the wall. A large iron door stands here, sheltered from direct outside attack. Arrow slits ten feet above the ground overlook the path.
^138

The iron door is locked. It can be opened with [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check or forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Any attempt to break down the door, whether successful or not, alerts creatures in areas C7, C8, C9, C12, and C13.

##### Arrow Slits

Any character who pauses and listens near the arrow slits hears noise from area C7—the occasional clatter of crockery and angry goblins arguing over whether the dishes need cleaning. The goblins aren't keeping watch from these arrow slits, but if the characters make a good deal of noise, the goblins will come and look. If they see intruders outside, the goblins shout an alarm.

#### C11: Ruined Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This tower has almost completely collapsed, although the ground floor still has a little open space. Rotting crates and ancient barrels show that provisions were once stored here.
> 
> A heavy curtain obscures a crumbling area to the south, and an intact door leads east. To the north, a short passage through the rubble ends before a screen of canvas.
^13b

Dusty canvas hides the northern entrance to this area, blending in with the surrounding stonework and rubble. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots a footpath leading to the hidden entrance. If the characters actively search the outside of the castle for a hidden entrance, they can make a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to spot the hidden entrance. Otherwise, this area contains nothing of interest or value.

#### C12: Guard Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four armored Humanoids stand around a stone brazier full of coals that glows in the middle of this small barrack. Four straw pallets line the east wall. The wall to the south has collapsed, but a boarded-up door in that direction is still standing. A door in better condition leads west, while a curtain hangs in an archway to the north.
^13d

Four [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) stand guard in this room. They keep watch from the arrow slit, so any characters creeping around outside the east side of the castle are likely to be spotted and attacked. The hobgoblins are smart, tough, and loyal to King Grol. At the start of combat, one hobgoblin runs to warn the king in area C14, then returns 2 rounds later to rejoin the fray.

This area was once a parlor for the castle's original occupants, though its rotted furnishings were broken up by the Cragmaws and used for firewood.

#### C13: Haunted Tower

The door to this room is boarded up from the north side. It takes a few rounds to remove the boards, which the characters should take as a warning that danger lies beyond.

The arrow slits here are shuttered, leaving the room dark. The boxed text assumes that the characters have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) or a light source.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The upper floors of this tower have collapsed to create a hollow silo thirty feet high. The upper reaches of the room are lost in shadows. It's clear that this area hasn't been used for some time. Dust, rubble, and broken glass cover the floor, and old worktables and bookshelves clutter the southern half of the room.
^13f

The Cragmaws believe this tower is haunted, but they're wrong. The area is the lair of a [grell](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/grell.md), a hideous flying monster. It can worm its way through the wreckage of the upper floors to leave the castle when it wants to hunt, but between excursions, it lurks in the shadows of the hollow tower. When the grell notices intruders in the lower portion of its tower, it silently drops from the shadows and attacks.

This room was once a library and workshop, but nothing of its original contents remains intact.

##### Treasure

The grell's nest in the upper part of the tower contains a battered wooden chest the monster found in the wreckage of the room below. The chest can't be seen from the floor, and it takes a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to climb up to the ledge upon which it rests. The chest is unlocked and contains 90 ep, 120 gp, a [potion of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md), a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-2nd-level.md) of [silence](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silence.md), and a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-3rd-level.md) of [revivify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/revivify.md).

#### C14: King's Quarters

Any character who listens at the door hears two voices in a heated discussion—a loud, growling voice demanding payment for something, and a silky-smooth reply.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber has been set up as a living space, with thick furs serving as carpets, old trophies hanging on the walls, and a brazier of coals burning brightly. A large bed stands to the north, and a round table with several chairs stands to the south near the door. Near the table, on the floor, is an [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) dwarf who looks badly beaten. Looming over the dwarf are three menacing figures: a mighty bugbear, a snarling wolf of great size, and an elf woman with white hair, gray skin, and gray robes.
^142

King Grol is a fierce old [bugbear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md). He rules the Cragmaws through pure intimidation. His fur is streaked with gray, his shoulders are stooped, and he wears a set of jeweled silver teeth over his own rotting fangs. He's agile and strong, demanding and vindictive, and no Cragmaw dares to cross him.

Grol is attended by his pet [dire wolf](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md), named Snarl, and a special guest: a [doppelganger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) disguised as a drow woman. The [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md) lies nearby (see "Unconscious Dwarf"). The doppelganger, Vyerith, is a messenger from the Spider, come to transport [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md) and the map to Wave Echo Cave. Grol wants to sell the map instead of surrendering it, and he and Vyerith are negotiating a price. Vyerith first wants to question Gundren to determine if anyone else knows the location of the mine. Then the doppelganger intends to betray the Spider by killing Gundren and destroying the map.

If the villains have been warned that an attack is imminent, Vyerith hides behind the door to the northeast, leaving it open a crack in the hope of attacking intruders from the rear. Grol holds Gundren hostage, ready to kill the dwarf if the characters don't back off.

##### Arrow Slits

The arrow slits are 15 feet above the ground outside, and the creatures here aren't keeping watch. They're unlikely to notice intruders moving around the exterior of the castle.

##### Northwest Room

This partially collapsed chamber was once a comfortable bathroom. It still contains a large tile tub, unused by the castle's current occupants.

##### Unconscious Dwarf

Near the southwest corner of the room is [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md), a dwarf [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md). He is [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) but stable at 0 hit points.

## What's Next?

If [Gundren Rockseeker](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gundren-rockseeker-pabtso.md) survives the ordeal at Cragmaw Castle, he offers the characters his thanks and asks that they escort him to Phandalin and then venture to Wave Echo Cave to learn the fate of his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. Gundren knows that someone called the Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain. Upon returning to Phandalin, Gundren offers the characters 25 gp each for their assistance and promises the party a 10 percent share of the mine's wealth once his operation is functioning.

Whether the characters sought the information from Agatha or Reidoth, negotiated with Hamun Kost, or recovered Gundren and his map from Cragmaw Castle, they now know the location of Wave Echo Cave. They can now venture to the old dwarven delve and discover who the Spider is and why he's so interested in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.

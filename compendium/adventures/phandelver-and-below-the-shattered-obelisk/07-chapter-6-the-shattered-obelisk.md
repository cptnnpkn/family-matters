# Chapter 6: The Shattered Obelisk
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk, p. 103* 

The characters have defeated Ruxithid, the Sawplee goblin leader who collected fragments of a Netherese obelisk. However, an unsettling truth has emerged: Ruxithid acted at the behest of much more powerful overlords who want the obelisk pieces to impose some terrible fate upon the town.

The characters discovered Ruxithid's map, which shows the locations of the remaining obelisk pieces. (This map is shown on this page; you should feel free to distribute it to your players as a handout.) Further, some townspeople are still missing and could be captives at one of these locations. To save Phandalin and its missing inhabitants, the characters must collect the remaining obelisk shards before the overlords do. Along the way, the heroes learn more about the shadowy threat looming over Phandalin.

![The secrets that await the...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/079-06-001-ch6-splash.webp#center "The secrets that await the heroes underground are even more terrifying than they might imagine")

## The Sinister Truth

The Sawplee goblins indirectly served three mind flayers that draw power from a malevolent Far Realm godlet named Ilvaash. Using their godlet as a warped sort of elder brain, these mind flayers are even more alien than others of their kind. (For more information, see chapter 7.)

Mind flayer activity in the area around Phandalin isn't new; centuries ago, as evidenced in Zorzula's Rest, mind flayers swept through the Underdark beneath and around Phandalin, consuming or destroying all in their path. That illithid empire eventually fell, but the mind flayer threat never entirely subsided. Now, mind flayers pose more of a threat to Phandalin than ever before.

### The Ritual

The mind flayers seek to enact a dreadful ritual that will transform the entire population of Phandalin into mind flayers.

As if that brutal process weren't terrifying enough, the ritual would work from a significant distance—even from the Far Realm itself, as described in chapter 8—and would affect individuals on a large scale. However, the fanatics learned from Ilvaash that transforming beings into mind flayers from afar requires a powerful source of magic.

After much communing and research, the mind flayer fanatics determined that the Netherese obelisk can power their ritual. Long ago, this obelisk was broken into fragments that are now scattered around the region. The mind flayer fanatics need to collect these fragments and rebuild the obelisk as completely as possible so the ancient object can power their ritual.

### The Map

![The Sawplee Goblins' Map](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/080-06-002-sawplee-goblins-map.webp#center)

The characters learned in chapter 5 about four obelisk shards around Phandalin that the Sawplee goblins gathered. The mind flayer fanatics possess these shards now, but the fanatics need as many obelisk fragments as possible to ensure their ritual will succeed.

The Sawplees' map reveals the locations of three other fragments: an abandoned dwarven temple called Talhundereth, the crypt beneath it, and a subterranean trading nexus called Gibbet Crossing. These locations are in the Starmetal Hills, several days northeast of Phandalin.

In the previous chapter, a loyal grimlock servant of [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) (an ally of the mind flayer fanatics that's described later in this adventure) traveled to Zorzula's Rest to retrieve the shards before the adventurers arrived to confront the goblins.

In this chapter, the characters might prevent the mind flayers from acquiring the other three fragments. The fanatics can proceed with the fragments they have, but the more obelisk pieces the mind flayers acquire, the more difficult it will be to stop their ritual. The characters must race against the clock to keep the mind flayers and their lackeys from recovering more of the shattered obelisk.

### Kidnapped Townspeople

If stopping the threat against Phandalin isn't enough motivation for the characters, concern about the still-missing townspeople should prompt them to follow the previous chapter's clues. The characters rescued some kidnapped townspeople in chapter 5, but there are eleven people still missing, and the locations on the goblins' map are the only leads about where these victims might be. The characters won't find these victims in this chapter, but they will find them later in the adventure.

In addition to the individuals below, other townspeople might still be missing, at your discretion. Consider identifying additional still-missing townspeople as individuals the characters are familiar with. Gwyn, Grista, Sister Garaele, Ander, and Halia haven't been kidnapped, but anyone else the characters might have come across in Phandalin might be victims.

#### Missing Individuals

The following people are still missing. These NPCs use the [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block. You should feel free to add more Phandalin townspeople people the list of those who are missing.

### Obelisk Fragments

In each of this chapter's three dungeons, the characters can find an obelisk fragment. Each of these fragments is larger than the shards in Phandalin, weighing 50 pounds and measuring more than a foot square. The fragments are supernaturally hardened and can't be damaged by any means the characters have.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins with a few opportunities for heroics in town, but three separate dungeons are the focus: the abandoned temple of Talhundereth, the haunted Crypt of the Talhund, and the subterranean Gibbet Crossing, all described later in this chapter. The locations of each dungeon are crudely marked on the map that the characters found at the end of the previous chapter. [Gwyn Oresong](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gwyn-oresong-pabtso.md) tells the characters more about these locations in the "Return to Phandalin" section. The characters can't enter the crypt without passing through Talhundereth, but they might approach Gibbet Crossing before or after they explore the temple and crypt.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 7th level when this chapter begins. In this chapter, the characters can advance to 9th level and no further. Advancement is handled as follows:

- The characters gain a level after facing the fragment guardian in either Talhundereth or Gibbet Crossing.  
- The characters gain a level once they overcome the guardians of all three obelisk fragments in this chapter.  

## Return to Phandalin

Before the characters travel to any dungeons, they should return to Phandalin from Zorzula's Rest. If they don't immediately seek her out, the dwarven sage [Gwyn Oresong](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gwyn-oresong-pabtso.md) invites the characters to join her at the Stonehill Inn.

Gwyn arranges for food and drinks. Over the meal, she asks the characters about their recent exploits and where they might go next. The Sawplee goblins' map surprises her. She asks to look at it and then says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "These old names have sad stories. Talhund means 'hidden gifts.' It relates to priests of Dumathoin, the dwarven god of secrets, mining, and gemstones.
> 
> "Talhundereth was a great temple to Dumathoin, and many important priests were laid to rest in the Crypt of the Talhund beneath it. Academics postulate that the crypt's entrance was protected by a great seal or doorway and that only Dumathoin's priests would know the secret to unlock it."
^22d

Examining the map further, Gwyn points at Gibbet Crossing and continues:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Gibbet Crossing is near the temple, but it's much deeper underground. It was a trading hub that grew where wide tunnels met. They say that deep gnomes, drow, and duergar once worked together there.
> 
> "They're all gone now. History tells us that mind flayers surged through the Underdark centuries ago like a terrible tide, consuming or oppressing everyone they came across. Gibbet Crossing fell. Talhundereth fell. Legends say that the mind flayers even breached the Crypt of the Talhund.
> 
> "The mind flayers soon abandoned these sites, and all three locations have since fallen to ruin. Only monsters and ghosts remain. Sometimes, followers of Dumathoin attempt to reclaim forgotten treasures or purify the despoiled sites. None have returned."
^22e

Gwyn believes that answers about the goblins' mysterious overlords must exist in these dangerous places. She urges caution and suggests that Talhundereth might be a better place to start than Gibbet Crossing, if only because she knows more about Talhundereth. Gibbet Crossing is more distant, and its dangers are unknown. Ultimately, the characters can choose their course of action.

### Phandalin Missions

Before they leave, the characters have more opportunities to help the people of Phandalin—as well as to gain a base of operations and learn more about the threat against the town—by undertaking the following quests.

#### Quest: Pip's Adventure

![A young boy named Pip foll...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/081-06-017-pip-follows-monsters.webp#center "A young boy named Pip followed some strange monsters deep into the hills, and the characters must bring him safely home")

This side mission can provide the characters with a base of operations for the rest of this chapter and can easily start at the end of the characters' meeting with [Gwyn Oresong](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gwyn-oresong-pabtso.md) at Stonehill Inn.

The Stonehills' ten-year-old son, Pip, hasn't returned from playing in the fields southeast of town. Toblen or Trilena Stonehill asks the characters to search the field and bring Pip home.

##### Pip's Curiosity

Pip spotted a trio of [encephalon gemmules](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/encephalon-gemmule-pabtso.md) bouncing through the hills east of the fields. He didn't know what they were and followed them. He thought they were dangerous, and he hoped to help Phandalin by learning more about them. Pip wants to be a hero just like the characters, whom he idolizes.

After Pip followed the gemmules for a while, the creatures dropped from sight. They fell through the top of a dwarven ruin and couldn't escape.

This put Pip in a quandary. He needed to tell someone about the monsters, but he knew he might get in trouble for leaving town. Worse, the monsters might escape, and no one would know where they'd gone. He watches the hole from behind a boulder while he decides what to do next.

If the characters don't seek Pip, the boy comes home well after dark and tells his parents about his adventure. The Stonehills ask the party to investigate the ruin their son described.

##### Finding Pip

The most direct way to find Pip is to follow his tracks in the field. This requires a character to succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. Alternatively, the characters might remember from their investigations in previous chapters that Pip is good friends with the halfling Carp Alderleaf. (Trilena Stonehill might even recommend talking to Carp.) Carp isn't allowed to venture far from Alderleaf Farm, but he points to where he saw Pip go into the hills.

It's easy to follow Pip's trail because he's following a trio of creatures that bounce on small, spindly feet. Characters who follow the trail for two miles find Pip hunkered behind a boulder. With obvious admiration for the characters, Pip explains his whole adventure.

##### Marthungrim's Home

Pip tells the characters the ruin was the home of a dwarf named Marthungrim who died long ago, before Pip's parents were born. The stairs descending into this dwarven home collapsed, so the gemmules can't escape. The ruin's floor is 20 feet down, and its ceilings are 9 feet high. Use map 6.1 when the characters venture into Marthungrim's home. The dotted line on the map represents the hole in the ceiling, through which the characters can lower themselves into the sunken home.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.1: Marthungrim's Home](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/082-map-6-01-marthungrims-home.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/083-map-6-01-marthungrims-home-player.webp#gallery)

Three [encephalon gemmules](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/encephalon-gemmule-pabtso.md) linger amid the rubble of the collapsed stairs. If attacked from above, they retreat into the surrounding rooms.

##### Marthungrim's Journal

In the southern room of the ruin, the characters find a dwarf skeleton lying beside a shrine to Dumathoin. A journal lies nearby, and it contains the following information:

- Marthungrim was a paladin of Dumathoin who excavated this home more than 60 years ago. Dumathoin tasked Marthungrim with returning spirits to rest when a crypt for the god's faithful was corrupted.  
- Marthungrim learned that the crypt lies beneath a temple called Talhundereth, but the temple teemed with dangerous monsters. The crypt is protected by a lock with a puzzle that Dumathoin's faithful could solve easier than others. (The puzzle's answer isn't included in the journal.)  
- Marthungrim planned to destroy the restless ghosts that haunt the crypt so they could rest in peace.  
- Badly wounded by a creature he described as "roiling heaps of tentacles," Marthungrim returned here. His last entry describes his wounds getting worse.  

If the characters share the journal's information with Gwyn, she recalls heroic tales about Marthungrim the Valiant. With the gemmules defeated, Marthungrim's former home might be a good base of operations for those who would carry on his legacy of doing good. It could be a good place to store obelisk fragments as well.

##### Reward

If the characters bring Pip home, the Stonehills offer the characters free rooms and board at their inn for as long as they're in the area. The characters might gain a greater reward for completing Marthungrim's mission, as described in the "Crypt of the Talhund" section later in this chapter.

#### Quest: The Odd Cow

![Daisy the Cow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/084-06-003-daisy-the-cow.webp#center)

The people of Phandalin aren't the only ones suffering from the Far Realm's creeping influence. Daisy, a cow that escaped from Old Narth's farm just north of Phandalin, ate some clover that was growing where the psionic goblins stopped to rest with a piece of the obelisk. The clover infected Daisy with a disturbing malady.

While the characters are in Phandalin, several townspeople describe a strange, greenish glow emanating from Edermath Orchard. If the characters ask Gwyn about it, she expresses concern that the same strange power the Sawplee goblins wielded might be at work somehow here. In fact, Daisy is the source of the glow. Tentacles occasionally slither from Daisy's body, flail about, and retreat into her skin without leaving a mark.

##### Daisy's Consumption

Before the characters can head to the orchard to investigate, the cow totters clumsily into the Town Green. As soon as a character approaches within 5 feet of her, Daisy vomits forth four [psychic gray oozes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/gray-ooze.md). The oozes use Mind Blast as often as they can and fight until destroyed. After Daisy vomits, the glow around her and her tentacles permanently disappear.

#### Quest: Missing Miners

Halia Thornton at the Miner's Exchange needs to find some missing miners. She first approaches any character she recruited into the Zhentarim, but she needs the job done regardless.

##### Halia's Job

Determined to find a site as lucrative as Wave Echo Cave, four miners recently scouted the Sword Mountains about 15 miles southwest of Phandalin. One of the miners, a human named Verno Tharbun, returned with tales of a "walking shrub with strange powers" that lured old Wallin Kreeve into a cave. The other miners—Wallin's daughter, Elise, and a quiet dwarf named Karthim Humblepick—followed him, but Verno rushed to town instead. Halia points at a map where this encounter occurred. She says Verno insists the shrub has probably killed the other miners by now, but Halia wants to know for sure.

##### The Miners' Fate

A [shambling mound](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/psionic-shambling-mound-pabtso.md) consumed a careless psionic goblin and gained some of the goblin's powers. The shambling mound stumbled upon the miners in the mountains and thought they'd be an easy meal. The shambling mound cast [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md) to lure Wallin into its clutches, but it was surprised when the other miners ushered Wallin into a chamber that's too narrow for the shambling mound to enter. The miners are now trapped by the relentless plant monster.

##### Trapped in the Cave

Halia suspects that Verno's tale occurred at Hardyhammer Mine, an early site whose owner died with no heirs to claim the mine. Hardyhammer Mine isn't difficult for the characters to find based on Halia's directions.

Use map 6.2 for Hardyhammer Mine.

![Map 6.2: Hardyhammer Mine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/085-06-004-map602-hardyhammer-mine.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cave Halia indicated is located along an isolated stretch of the mountain, obscured by fallen rubble and tough bushes.
^23c

The [shambling mound](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/psionic-shambling-mound-pabtso.md) lurks just within the eastern cave, unable to attack the miners in the western chamber. The shambling mound has the following additional action option:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Spellcasting (Psionics).** The shambling mound casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 8):
> 
> At will: [minor illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md)
> 
> 1/day: [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md) (already cast)
^23d

##### Rescuing the Miners

When the characters rescue the miners, Karthim thanks the characters and says the miners were lucky they didn't stumble into one of the older dwarven ruins around here. "Places like that are really unlucky," Karthim says.

Karthim isn't a follower of Dumathoin, but he's heard of great treasures in Talhundereth's vault and the sacred crypt beneath the temple. He can pinpoint the location on a map, which corresponds to the location the characters discovered in the previous chapter.

##### Treasure

The miners weren't idle in their captivity. While trying to excavate an escape route in the back of the cave, they discovered a lucrative vein of silver. If the characters dispatch the shambling mound, the miners offer a share of their stake as thanks. This share amounts to 250 gp each month for the next year, payable at the Phandalin Miner's Exchange.

## Talhundereth

Talhundereth is a subterranean temple to Dumathoin, the dwarven god of buried secrets. Millennia ago, Talhundereth was a vibrant and populous temple visited by many worshipers of Dumathoin. Talhundereth was built above the sacred Crypt of the Talhund, where the most ardent priests of Dumathoin were entombed.

Talhundereth was as busy as the Crypt of the Talhund was peaceful: miners, merchants, and priests alike came to Talhundereth seeking wisdom, political alliances, secret martial training, and hints at where to find wealth. Eventually, however, the passages to Talhundereth grew dangerous and the temple saw fewer visitors.

A few centuries ago, Talhundereth was abandoned by all but a few vigilant defenders. Mind flayers took advantage of Talhundereth's depleted state to attack; during this invasion, a collapse rocked the temple and crypt alike. Both the mind flayer invaders and the temple guardians gave up Talhundereth as lost, though the mind flayers' psychic stain remained.

Since that attack, various bandits and monsters have squatted in the abandoned temple. Sometime after the mind flayers' reign, aspiring lore-seekers brought one piece of the shattered obelisk into Talhundereth's chapel and another into its crypt, hoping that studying the pieces in close proximity might reveal more about the obelisk's previous powers. That group was twisted by the psychic magic resonating in the crypt. The lore-seekers lost all interest in scholarship and abandoned the fragments.

### Cult of the Obelisk

The most recent faction to enter Talhundereth is a gang that calls itself the Cult of the Obelisk. These cultists were drawn to the broken obelisk, responding to a psychic call to serve a greater force. Once Humanoids—such as humans, dwarves, and elves—the cultists embraced the power of the Far Realm and transformed into [Humanoid mutates](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/humanoid-mutate-pabtso.md). They believe the obelisk provides them a conduit to an entity from the Far Realm.

A malevolent Aberration called an [encephalon cluster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/encephalon-cluster-pabtso.md) never leaves the obelisk's side. The encephalon cluster occasionally gouts bizarre offspring called gemmules, which the cult members view as progeny of the alien intelligence they worship (and which they treat like vicious pets).

The cultists capture any unsuspecting individuals they find in Talhundereth and feed them to the encephalon cluster as sacrifices to their strange god—if the gemmules don't eat the captives first.

The Cult of the Obelisk is led by [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) Henlifel. [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) abandoned his family to follow the malign whispers that led him to the obelisk. [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md)'s sons have come with a few retainers to see whether they can talk some sense into their father. These drow are in Talhundereth's reading room (area T14) and might parlay with the characters.

### Temple Features

The features described below are common throughout Talhundereth.

#### Dwarven Construction

The temple's stone remains strong despite millennia of neglect. Surviving furnishings, such as tables and beds, are also made of stone. Wall carvings of mountain peaks and multifaceted gemstones predominate, as these images are sacred to Dumathoin.

#### Darkness

The temple's sconces haven't held torches in ages. The current denizens of Talhundereth rely on [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or some other method of seeing in the dark.

#### Doors

Doors throughout the temple are made of 2-inch-thick slabs of stone with simple handles a few feet from the floor. They open and close easily on ancient hinges. Doors are unlocked unless otherwise specified.

#### Ceilings

Ceilings throughout the temple are 12 feet high unless the text states otherwise.

### Talhundereth Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.3: Talhundereth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/086-map-6-03-talhundereth.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/087-map-6-03-talhundereth-player.webp#gallery)

#### T1: Temple Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The wide cavern ends at an enormous stone double door. Each side bears the image of a towering mountain with a carved gemstone at its heart. A long roll of cloth props one side of the double door open. A fissure in the wall opens to a tunnel leading west.
^24a

The cloth propping open one side of the double door contains the withered corpse of a human smuggler.

The tunnel leading from the crevasse to the west is 5 feet high, with occasional carved steps and smoothed rock edges. The passage leads to area G11 in Gibbet Crossing.

#### T2: Deepening Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Elaborate carvings of mountain landscapes and treasure piles line the walls of this broad staircase as it descends deeper underground. Several landings on the staircase hold statues, and some bear doorways. The stairs end abruptly at a wall of tumbled boulders from some long-ago collapse.
^24c

Two [galeb duhr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr.md), Fremine and Frowode, lurk near the collapse, disguised as boulders. They are guards for the medusa in area T3. If anyone approaches the door to area T3, one of them stands and commands the intruders to leave while the other prepares to fight if necessary.

If a fight breaks out with the galeb duhr, the occupants of area T3 come to investigate after 3 rounds. The occupants of T3 act immediately after the galeb duhr.

#### T3: Lesser Chapel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this room are carved with images of dwarven miners kneeling in pious reflection. Three statues of humans kneel in the room's corners. An altar against the room's east wall is studded with sockets, as though for gemstones. A door to the south leads further into the temple. Studying the sockets carefully is a pensive woman with snakes for hair. A short, rock-like creature next to her takes notes with a stone stylus on a stone slab.
^24e

![Honna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/088-06-005-honna.webp#center)

This chapel, intended for Talhundereth's visitors, was plundered of its gemstones long ago. It's now the lair of a [medusa](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md) named [Honna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/honna-pabtso.md) and her companions. Only one companion, a [galeb duhr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr.md) named Cameren, is with her now (the others are in area T2). [Honna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/honna-pabtso.md) loves art, and she scours the world for the most exquisite creatures she can transform into statues. She likes the carvings here and has been gradually capturing bandits and explorers to force them into kneeling poses before petrifying them; the statues are three of her victims. [Honna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/honna-pabtso.md)'s galeb duhr idolize her and eagerly serve as her bodyguards, though she doesn't care much about their fates and hasn't bothered to learn their names.

[Honna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/honna-pabtso.md) is likely to react to intruders with violence, but if the characters try to talk with her, she spins a lie about the sanctity of the dwarven spirits here. She asks the characters to kneel in reflection as shown in the carvings, then tries to petrify them.

#### T4: Priest Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Most of this small room collapsed long ago, forming a narrow passage through the earth into the area beyond. A stone bed draped with furs is the only furnishing here to have survived the collapse.
^250

A lesser priest charged with tending the chapel resided here long ago; it's now where [Honna](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/honna-pabtso.md) sleeps.

The collapse formed a narrow passage between this area and the vault (area T8). Small or smaller creatures can traverse the passage normally. Medium or larger creatures can traverse the passage after spending 8 hours clearing boulders away (either one person clearing boulders for 8 hours, four people clearing boulders for 2 hours, or any equivalent combination).

#### T5: Sparring Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Old weapon racks are along this sparring chamber's west and northwest walls, while three stands hold various pieces of armor to the north. Gouges in the walls indicate that this room once saw much use. A small door leads east.
^252

People who used this chamber didn't only spar with each other; they also tested their prowess against three suits of magically animated plate armor sized for dwarves. These constructs still stand ready to fight intruders. One is a [helmed horror](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/helmed-horror.md); the other two are [animated armors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md). When a character spends more than a few moments in this room, the helmed horror utters, "squad tactics routine" in Dwarvish and all three suits of armor attack. They don't attack anyone who clearly surrenders and leaves the room, though they'll attack if the characters who surrender return. The suits don't leave this room.

#### T6: Training Master's Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This bedroom contains a stone desk, a stone bed, and a metal display holding a single, battered greataxe.
^254

Over the years, many training masters lived here. A training master oversaw all the sparring in the adjacent room.

##### Treasure

The [greataxe](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/greataxe.md) on display isn't magical, but it has an [immovable rod](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/immovable-rod.md) as its shaft. The button to control the rod is within easy reach of anyone using the greataxe as a weapon.

#### T7: Armory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Other than a few broken shields and warped crossbow bolts on battered shelves and hooks, nothing remains in this room.
^257

Six [dust mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/dust-mephit.md) lair here with a [wight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight.md) who follows them around and aids their malicious antics. The creatures are hiding when the characters enter this room, and they ambush the characters unless one or more characters succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

When there are no intruders, the mephits fixate on what lies behind the locked door to the vault (area T8) and make ineffective attempts to breach it. They can't unlock the door, and their clumsy efforts have choked the vault's locks with dust.

This armory was looted long ago, but casual looters were unable to breach the heavy locked door to the vault at the back of the armory.

#### T8: Vault

The door from the armory (area T7) is secured with a complex lock. If the characters examine it, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This ancient vault door has three locks, each housed within a carving of a mountain.
^259

All three locks must be opened before the vault door will open. One of the locks is already unlocked. Each of the other two can be opened with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md), although any inspection of the locks determines they're caked with dust. If the dust isn't cleared from the locks, Dexterity checks to open them have disadvantage.

The characters might also enter this room through the collapse from area T4. Opening the locked door from the inside is straightforward.

When the characters peer into the vault, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Glittering heaps of coins, statuettes, and weapons throughout this room are covered in a thin layer of dust.
^25a

##### Treasure

The hoard here consists of 510 pp, 1,250 gp, twelve small gems of various kinds worth 100 gp each, a platinum [holy symbol](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/holy-symbol.md) of Dumathoin worth 150 gp, three golden statuettes of dwarf warriors worth 400 gp each, a [potion of invulnerability](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invulnerability.md), and [eyes of minute seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/eyes-of-minute-seeing.md).

#### T9: Residential Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Many doors lead into this room, which has four stone chairs facing each other in the middle of it. One chair is covered with fresh blood.
^25d

This room served as a lounge. Several bones are scattered around the bloody chair. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check identifies them as goat bones and surmises the blood on the chair is also from a goat. The goat recently wandered from an underground traveling caravan. When it stumbled into Talhundereth, a member of the Cult of the Obelisk sacrificed it in unfettered devotion to the obelisk.

If the characters make a lot of noise here, Falfark (see area T10) peeks from the adjacent room to investigate.

#### T10: Private Rooms

There are seven of these rooms, all furnished similarly. When the characters enter the northwest room, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room contains nothing more than a stone bed, desk, and stool. A robed figure sits at the desk. Nearby, a pyramid-shaped nugget bounces idly on spindly legs.
^25f

The northwest room is currently inhabited by a [Humanoid mutate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/humanoid-mutate-pabtso.md) named Falfark and an [encephalon gemmule](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/encephalon-gemmule-pabtso.md) (see appendix A for both stat blocks) that Falfark treats as a guardian. Falfark is a member of the Cult of the Obelisk.

Falfark prefers surprise or treachery when he's outnumbered, but he's too erratic to be duplicitous. He frequently preaches about the stone that "speaks the truth of the Far Realm" and "disgorges its young to feed." He speaks like a deluded prophet and encourages the characters to feed the smallest among them to his gemmule. If the characters resist or threaten them, Falfark and the gemmule attack in a fury.

If the characters don't do anything about the gemmule within a week of encountering Falfark, the gemmule transforms into an adult encephalon cluster that consumes Falfark as its first meal.

#### T11: Common Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The long stone table here is broken in two pieces. Several metal chests are stacked against a wall. The largest opening leading from this room is choked with rubble and the skeletal remains of dwarves and mind flayers.
^261

Long ago, invading mind flayers and temple defenders fought fiercely in this room. Psychic echoes of the battle have drawn an [intellect snare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/intellect-snare-pabtso.md).

The intellect snare lurks in an alcove behind the stack of metal chests. It amplifies the psychic echoes in this room to show a scene of a wailing mind flayer atop the table, struck so hard by an armored dwarf's hammer that the stone table cracked. The image of the dwarf retreats toward the stacked chests with a triumphant cry, beckoning the viewer to follow. As soon as a creature gets within the range of the intellect snare's Cacophony of Minds, it slithers forth and attacks. It follows foes who retreat and fights until slain.

##### Treasure

Most of the metal chests contain nothing but dust or battered dishes, but one holds an [alchemy jug](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemy-jug.md) beneath a few mugs.

#### T12: Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This large kitchen contains stone counters, a sink of clear water, and an oven containing orange embers. A rack of dull metal kitchen implements hangs from the ceiling.
^264

This kitchen has a few enchantments that remain active. The sink replenishes itself with fresh water every hour using [create or destroy water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md), first eliminating water and then conjuring clean water to replace it. The oven maintains a constant temperature suitable for cooking. These furnishings are too heavy to be moved.

The only people who have used this kitchen recently are the drow explorers camped in the reading room (area T14).

##### Treasure

One drow explorer left a [backpack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/backpack.md) here. It contains 100 feet of [silk rope](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/silk-rope-50-feet.md), three [daggers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md), a blank [book](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/book.md), a [calligrapher's kit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/calligraphers-supplies.md), and a silver medallion displaying a lizard's head with a quill behind it. The medallion is worth 15 gp.

#### T13: Pantry

The goods once stored on the shelves in this old pantry are long decayed, leaving nothing other than a few empty casks and boxes.

##### Secret Door

A character who searches the pantry shelves and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds a secret door to the librarian's room (area T15). Pushing on the door causes it to swing outward.

#### T14: Reading Room

![Two brothers and their ass...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/089-06-006-drow-brothers.webp#center "Two brothers and their associates infiltrated Talhundereth and are trying to retrieve their father from an evil cult")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four large stone chairs with wide armrests are pushed to one side of this room, making room for three bedrolls, where three drow sit tensely.
^269

The dwarves of Talhundereth were protective of their library and unwilling to share its lore with most visitors. Typically, knowledge seekers would speak with the temple's librarian and wait here while the librarian retrieved books for them.

Three neutral [drow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md) temporarily live here. Their names are Erdan Vosselth, Thiala Sharne, and Vellios Keethe, and they have proudly worked for the Henlifel family as guards and laborers their whole lives. The drow are quick to fight Aberrations that intrude in their camp, but they cautiously greet other creatures (including the characters) in the hope of avoiding violence and maybe even making allies.

##### Talking with the Drow

Unless the characters speak Elvish or Undercommon, the drow call their leaders in area T15 to translate. Whether they talk or fight, their leaders arrive quickly to see what's going on.

The drow share the following points:

- **Arrival.** The drow came from the Underdark only recently, through the entrance (area T1).  
- **Brothers.** Nythalyn and [Yanthdel Henlifel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yanthdel-henlifel-pabtso.md) (see area T15) lead this group. The brothers have come to try to convince their father, [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md), to return home. Their father said he received a psychic call, and they worry he has joined a dangerous cult (they don't know that [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) leads the cult).  
- **Common Enemy.** A psychic creature lairs in the common room (area T11). The drow suspect that the image there is some sort of dangerous lure and avoid that room.  
- **Library.** The adjacent library is filled with books. Yanthdel can read the languages the books are written in, but the other drow can't.  
- **Strange Pets.** The drow want to force their way into the chambers beyond, but they know that the cultists are too strong, especially with their weird pets (the encephalon gemmules).  

#### T15: Librarian's Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room has a wide bed surrounded by tall bookshelves. Two drow pensively sort through scattered papers.
^26c

Nythalyn and [Yanthdel Henlifel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yanthdel-henlifel-pabtso.md), both neutral [drow elite warriors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow-elite-warrior.md), rest and plan in this bedroom. The drow brothers speak Common in addition to Elvish and Undercommon; Yanthdel also speaks Dwarvish. The most significant item among their scattered notes is a scrap of rough cloth with a map of areas T1, T2, and T9 through T17, including the secret door to this room.

##### Talking with the Brothers

Whether here or in the adjacent reading room, Nythalyn and Yanthdel are likely to speak to the characters. They add the following points to what their allies already said:

- **Finding Father.** The brothers hope to spot their father in the next chamber (area T17) so they can talk to him, but he hasn't yet been seen there. He remains deeper in the temple.  
- **Help Needed.** Nythalyn and Yanthdel ask the characters to capture [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md). They're reluctant to accompany the characters (or to send their retainers with the characters) unless the characters are particularly persuasive, as they think the cultists are too powerful.  
- **Hold Fast.** The brothers acknowledge that their father isn't likely to come willingly, so they hope that the party can subdue him and bring him back here. They don't care what happens to any other cultists.  
- **Redemption Needed.** The brothers are certain they can convince their father of the error of his ways, despite [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md)'s decision to join the cult.  
- **Worth the Effort.** If the characters ask for a reward, Yanthdel reveals his magical periapt (see "Treasure" below) and agrees to exchange it for his father.  

##### Secret Door

A character who searches the room and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds a secret door to the pantry (area T13). The characters find it automatically if they have already examined the drow brothers' map. Pulling a hidden lever causes the secret door to swing open.

##### Treasure

Yanthdel has a [periapt of health](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/periapt-of-health.md), which he gives to the characters as a reward if they return his father. He also gives it to characters who return with news that his father has been killed, so long as Yanthdel believes that the characters tried to approach [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) peacefully.

#### T16: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shelves cover the stone walls of this room from floor to ceiling. Sagging books that have been reduced to little more than scraps and dust fill the shelves, although a few books bound in metal have survived the long years of abandonment.
^271

The drow explorers perused the surviving books in this library but found nothing of use. Most of the surviving books describe Dumathoin's faith, gem cutting secrets, or forgotten mines. The books are written in Dwarvish.

##### The Granite Ledger

One of the books that the drow haven't yet touched has metal pages and a cover made of thin plates of granite. This book is The Granite Ledger, a compendium of Talhundereth's secrets. An ancient protective ward remains on the book; when the book is touched, two [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) rise from the floor and attempt to smash anyone in the room who isn't openly wearing Dumathoin's holy symbol.

The ledger lists those buried in the Crypt of the Talhund. It also provides instructions in Dwarvish for how to open the crypt's entrance in area T20.

#### T17: Defaced Statue

![A member of the Cult of th...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/090-06-007-malinia.webp#center "A member of the Cult of the Obelisk named Malinia defaces a statue")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An alcove at the end of a majestic yet rubble-choked hall contains an enormous statue of a dwarf scholar atop a high plinth. A figure chips at the statue's head, shaping the visage into a wailing, inhuman face. Four pyramid-shaped nuggets with legs lounge around the statue's base. A double door leads to the east.
^274

This room, once at the end of the Deepening Hall (area T2), is 30 feet high.

The Cult of the Obelisk labors to transform this statue of Dumathoin into the likeness of the encephalon cluster that guards the obelisk fragment they revere. The plinth is 15 feet high, and the statue atop it is another 10 feet tall.

A [Humanoid mutate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/humanoid-mutate-pabtso.md) named [Malinia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/malinia-pabtso.md) is defacing the statue. [Malinia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/malinia-pabtso.md) is perched on the statue's wide shoulders, 20 feet above the floor. Four [encephalon gemmules](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/encephalon-gemmule-pabtso.md) (see appendix A for both stat blocks) occasionally gnaw on chips of stone that fall from [Malinia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/malinia-pabtso.md)'s work. The cultist is quick to send the gemmules into battle, supporting them from her high perch with Nightmare Blast attacks.

#### T18: Cleansing Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Standing in a circle in the middle of this room are four hooded figures praying in low, indiscernible voices.
> 
> The north and south walls of this room bear four stone basins beneath metal spigots. The northwest spigot is broken and choked with fungus, and it drips murky water into the basin. The other basins are dry.
^276

Worshipers of Dumathoin approaching the worship hall (area T21) cleansed themselves in these basins. This room is now the domain of four [Humanoid mutates](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/humanoid-mutate-pabtso.md) who are members of the Cult of the Obelisk. One of them is [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md), the father of the brothers in area T15. He has the stats of a Humanoid mutate, but he also has [Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) +4. The other three mutates are named Chals, Harralie, and Paulam.

The cultists are happy to see people they can kill and feed to the monster in the worship hall to the south (area T21). They've seen the drow explorers lurking about and are eager to fight. They utter phrases like "Food for the obelisk is food for the brain!" and "Your souls will twist in the Far Realm!"

If the characters express a desire to talk with [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md), he makes a big show of calling off his cultists and listening to what the characters have to say. He offers to talk, but not if it means leaving sight of the other cultists. This eagerness to talk is a ruse; [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) has no intention of leaving Talhundereth just because his sons are "too ignorant to see that the obelisk is a keyhole to impossible truths of the Far Realm." If [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) can use a pretense of diplomacy to split up the characters, get one or both of his sons alone, or any similar advantage, he attacks. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check predicts his impending treachery.

##### The Spigots

Only the fungus-choked spigot remains operational. The fast-growing fungus is edible, and the water passing through it is surprisingly nutritious. The cultists subsist on both, though the fungus is tainted with Far Realm energy and contributes to the cultists' mutations.

#### T19: Procession Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Columns within this pillared procession hall bear images of pious dwarves holding mining picks.
^279

These images were once brilliantly painted, but only the paint around the eye sockets and clasped hands of the dwarves remains, leaving an impression of sickness and suspicion.

![The procession hall leadin...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/091-06-008-crypt-of-the-talhund.webp#center "The procession hall leading to the Crypt of the Talhund is lined with sacred statues of dwarves")

#### T20: Crypt Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The west end of this long room bears an elaborate carving of a mountain filled with gemstones. On the west wall is a dial covered in simpler carvings. The
> 
> dial's center has a faceted indentation, like a socket for a gem. Above the dial is a phrase: "Only a complete gift opens the crypt beyond."
^27b

The dial serves as a lock to the entrance of the Crypt of the Talhund. Fourteen carvings cross the dial, which has a fixed arrow pointing downward at its top. The indentation in the dial's middle is a magical keyhole that requires the insertion of a faceted gemstone.

##### Dumathoin Knows

Any character who worships Dumathoin realizes how to open the lock, as described below. The Granite Ledger in area T16 includes instructions in Dwarvish for opening the lock.

##### Unlocking the Crypt

The dial's carvings depict a faceted gemstone in various stages of completion, ranging from a handful of marks to a completed, emerald-cut stone. As with a combination lock, the dial must be rotated in the correct order. The correct combination begins with the least finished gemstone carving and proceeds in order, ending with the most finished carving.

After the characters rotate the dial to the correct combination, a gem must be placed in the center socket to open the lock. Any of the gems in the vault (area T8) suffices.

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check realizes how to open the lock. Once the lock is open, the characters can open the door to the Crypt of the Talhund.

##### An Incorrect Solution

If the characters insert a gem after they've dialed the wrong combination, a rumbling sound rolls through the room. Creatures in the room must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

This protective measure triggers only once. After it's triggered, the characters can try additional solutions until the lock opens. Once the characters have spent 1 hour trying to open the lock, they accidentally dial the correct combination and realize they need to insert a gem into the indentation.

##### An Alternate Solution

The mind flayers who attacked Talhundereth long ago found a different solution to the puzzle. The center indentation can be overloaded with psychic magic, regardless of the positioning of the dials. Dealing at least 20 psychic damage to the indentation shatters and opens the lock. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check realize this solution. At your discretion, [Ontharyx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ontharyx-pabtso.md) or other Humanoid mutates might suggest this solution if interrogated.

#### T21: Worship Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This hall has several pillars carved with images of mountains. Some of the pillars are broken and blackened, as though from an intense fire. Carved into the west wall is a statue of a dwarven king stoically gripping a warhammer. An altar at the statue's feet is smashed into rubble, around which hops a brain-shaped mass of gelatinous eggs. A black fragment of stone with glowing green details sits amid the rubble.
^281

This large worship hall was the site of a fierce battle between the mind flayers and the temple defenders. The statue depicting one aspect of Dumathoin as a kingly dwarf survived the intense fight, but the altar before the statue did not.

##### Obelisk Fragment

The rubble that used to be the altar stone is now the resting place of a Netherese obelisk fragment. See the "Obelisk Fragments" section at the beginning of this chapter for more information about its properties.

The obelisk's magical energies enhance the lingering psychic echoes from the mind flayers. These echoes attracted both an [encephalon cluster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/encephalon-cluster-pabtso.md) and members of the Cult of the Obelisk. The encephalon cluster is here all the time at the west end of the room; it doesn't need to leave because the cultists feed it victims they kidnap. The cultists rarely enter this room except for these feedings, as they consider the chamber a sacred space.

##### If the Characters Fail

The characters might reach this room but be forced to retreat. In this case, the mind flayer fanatics have time to send minions to recover the obelisk fragment. Unless the characters return quickly, these villains acquire the fragment and deliver it to the fanatics in Illithinoch (see later in this adventure). Record if this happens, as it alters how the characters confront the mind flayer fanatics in chapter 8.

## Crypt of the Talhund

Constructed beneath Talhundereth, the Crypt of the Talhund was where priests of Dumathoin (known as the Talhund) were laid to rest. The mind flayers who attacked Talhundereth long ago also plundered the crypt, and the psychic stain they left on this sacred place persists to this day.

### Crypt Features

Once the characters solve the puzzle in Talhundereth's crypt entrance (area T20), they can enter this structure when they wish. The following features are common throughout the Crypt of the Talhund.

#### Dwarven Made

The crypt is solid dwarven construction. Its stone remains strong despite millennia of neglect. Carvings of dwarf priests are prevalent, as are carvings of mountain peaks and multifaceted gemstones. Subtle enchantments cause the carvings of gemstones to glitter like genuine gems.

#### Darkness

The crypt isn't illuminated, and its denizens rely on [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume that the characters have a light source or some other method of seeing in the dark.

#### Doors

Doors throughout the temple are made of 2-inch-thick slabs of stone with simple handles a few feet from the floor. They open and close easily on ancient hinges. Doors and secret doors are unlocked unless otherwise specified.

#### Ceilings

Ceilings throughout the crypt are 12 feet high.

#### Unnamed

Although many dead are buried here, nothing indicates the names of the deceased. The temple's followers believed that Dumathoin gives the Talhund new, secret names in death, so their mortal names aren't memorialized.

#### Crypt Hauntings

The crypts retain the echoes of the mind flayers' invasion, and these echoes make the spirits within the crypt uneasy. Where the text references a crypt haunting, roll a `d6` and consult the Crypt Hauntings table to determine the nature of the ghostly image or effect encountered there (or choose one that seems evocative). A haunting can't leave the location where it's encountered and doesn't physically interact with the characters in any way.

In each location with a haunting, there's a way to put the haunt to rest (usually by restoring the location's solemnity or removing evidence of mind flayer activity); these methods are listed in the relevant areas. Putting the haunt to rest means the haunting no longer occurs there. Any character who worships Dumathoin knows how to put the haunts to rest. Otherwise, characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check know.

If the characters take a long rest in the crypt, you can have a random crypt haunting appear at that location anytime during their rest. These spontaneous hauntings can't be put to rest, but they don't need to be quelled to purify the crypt. Once the crypt is purified no haunts ever occur there.

These hauntings are disturbing, and the fifth and sixth options on the table below involve body horror. Check your players' comfort level before including these hauntings in your game; you can roll a `d4` instead.

**Crypt Hauntings**

`dice: [](07-chapter-6-the-shattered-obelisk.md#^crypt-hauntings)`

| dice: d6 | Haunting |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Each character feels a creeping sensation along their scalp, as of probing tentacles seeking a weak spot in their skull. |
| 2 | The ghostly image of an elderly dwarf in priestly vestments wanders around as though in shock, gripping a battleaxe stained with purple ichor. |
| 3 | Each character gains a nagging suspicion that mind flayers are currently invading some sacred or secret place important to that character, such as a childhood home. |
| 4 | Each character hears low muttering in Dwarvish that repeats, "The brain eaters have come! Save us! If you cannot save us, avenge us!" |
| 5 | A ghostly image of one character (determined randomly) lies on the floor, their skull cracked open and their brain removed. The image does nothing but twitch and drool. |
| 6 | The ghostly image of a dwarf zombie lurches from a wall, puts a rotted finger to its lips, then uses its other hand to peel back its ribcage and reveal a gem hidden in its chest cavity. The zombie then disappears into the wall. This image repeats every few minutes, but the ghostly zombie comes from a different section of the wall each time. |
^crypt-hauntings

#### Purifying the Crypt

Purifying the Crypt of the Talhund requires quelling all the crypt hauntings and defeating the ghosts. When this happens, a sigh like grinding stone echoes through the crypt, and each room momentarily flickers with light. No more crypt hauntings appear in any locations, and no spontaneous hauntings occur.

##### Haunting Locations

Spontaneous hauntings are in the crypt's ghostly hall (area P2), honored approach (area P6), reliquary (area P7), valiant approach (area P11), and haunted hall (area P16).

##### Dumathoin's Blessing

When the characters purify the crypt, any character that helped put a haunt to rest or defeated one of the crypt's ghosts gains the blessing of Dumathoin. Dumathoin can rescind this blessing at any time, at your discretion, such as if the character proves to be an enemy of dwarvenkind. The blessing otherwise adheres to the rules for "blessings" presented in the "Dungeon Master's Guide":

> [!embed-reward]- Blessing of Dumathoin
> ![Blessing of Dumathoin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/blessing-of-dumathoin-pabtso.md)

### Crypt of the Talhund Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.4.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.4: Crypt of the Talhund](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/092-map-6-04-crypt-of-the-talhund.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/093-map-6-04-crypt-of-the-talhund-player.webp#gallery)

#### P1: Lower Landing

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four stone sarcophagi stand against the walls here, two against the northern wall and two against the southern wall. A statue of a dwarf warrior stands between each pair of sarcophagi. The statues and sarcophagi are all badly cracked, as if they would fall apart with a touch.
^293

Each sarcophagus holds a dwarf crypt guardian whose spirit was corrupted by the mind flayers' magic. When a sarcophagus is disturbed or a living creature attempts to leave through the doorway to the west, all four crypt guardians burst out to fight until destroyed. The crypt guardians use the [revenant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/revenant.md) stat block with the following changes:

- They speak Dwarvish only.  
- They have sworn vengeance against all living trespassers in the crypt.  
- They don't rejuvenate if the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section).  

The stone in this room was badly weakened in the mind flayer assault. The statues fall to pieces if disturbed, creating difficult terrain across the southern half or northern half of the room, depending on which statue is broken. The four sarcophagi also collapse if disturbed, though each creates difficult terrain only in its square.

#### P2: Ghostly Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The sound of splashing water echoes from the west end of this long hallway. The north wall has three doors, and the south wall bears an elaborate carving of a procession of dwarf priests carrying wrapped bodies.
^295

There is a crypt haunting in this somber hall (see "Crypt Hauntings" in the "Crypt Features" section). Returning the hall to silence by defeating or driving off the creatures in the watery room at the end of the hall (area P5) puts the haunt to rest.

#### P3: Corpse Preparation Rooms

These rooms all look similar, and each can be described as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stone slab in the middle of this room bears a few metal tools covered in dust. A deep basin is near the slab. Wall carvings show dwarves reverently tending to the dead.
^297

Specially trained attendants prepared deceased Talhund in these connected rooms:

- **East Room.** Attendants here washed the bodies and stitched up any wounds. The basin is empty except for a few pumice stones.  
- **Center Room.** Attendants here placed a sanctified gemstone within the corpse's chest. The basin once held dozens of sacred gemstones, but the mind flayers took the gems when they vanquished this place's defenders. The basin is now empty.  
- **West Room.** Attendants here dressed and armored the prepared corpses. The basin holds several jumbled pieces of armor; see "Treasure" below.  

##### Secret Door

Characters who search the center room and succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discover a secret door hidden within the carving of a dwarf attendant placing her hand in the chest of a deceased priest. Pressing the attendant's hand causes the door to swing open into area P4.

##### Treasure

The armor pieces in the western room contain all the parts for a serviceable suit of [plate armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/plate-armor.md). As this armor is funerary armor for the Talhund, Dumathoin's faithful are reluctant to attack its wearer. Undead dwarves in the Crypt of the Talhund have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone wearing this armor.

#### P4: Hidden Sanctum Access Rooms

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small, empty room bears a heavy stone door opposite its entrance.
^29b

The stone doors to access the rotating sanctum (area P14) pull open. If the sanctum hasn't been rotated into position (see areas P9 and P13), the doors are blocked by solid stone. Otherwise, they open into area P14.

#### P5: Watery Chamber

![The ruins of the Crypt of ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/094-06-009-hydra-and-water-weird.webp#center "The ruins of the Crypt of the Talhund now serve as lairs for many monsters, including a hydra and a water weird")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Most of this room has collapsed into a flooded pit. The dark water ripples and splashes strangely, as though something lurks deep within it.
^29d

The collapse that occurred here long ago disturbed an underground wellspring, flooding the whole area.

A [hydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md) named [Grandlejaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grandlejaw-pabtso.md) dozes in the water, keeping one or two heads alert for danger. The source of the splashing is a high-strung [water weird](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) named [Kellikilli](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kellikilli-pabtso.md). After realizing [Kellikilli](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kellikilli-pabtso.md) is inedible, [Grandlejaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grandlejaw-pabtso.md) grudgingly decided to tolerate the water weird. The water weird's constant, frenetic motion keeps the water bubbly, which the hydra enjoys. [Kellikilli](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kellikilli-pabtso.md) likes fighting alongside a creature as tough as [Grandlejaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grandlejaw-pabtso.md).

If the characters approach this room cautiously, they see [Grandlejaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grandlejaw-pabtso.md) and [Kellikilli](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kellikilli-pabtso.md) interacting: [Grandlejaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grandlejaw-pabtso.md) grumpily nips at the water weird for jostling a sleeping head, and [Kellikilli](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kellikilli-pabtso.md) responds with a high-pitched giggle and squirts water into one of [Grandlejaw](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grandlejaw-pabtso.md)'s faces.

The water weird is too distracted to notice anyone who doesn't disturb the water, but the hydra is hungry and attacks anything that looks edible. If a fight breaks out, the water weird stays in the pool but grabs creatures and drags them into the pool if it can. If the water weird is badly injured or if the hydra is slain, the water weird flees.

#### P6: Honored Approach

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This hall has a stone door at the north end. Another door to the east is askew on its hinges, brushing against an elongated, crumbling skull on the floor. Both doors bear Dwarvish writing.
^29f

The stone door to the north has the words "the honored dead" carved into it in Dwarvish. The askew door to the east bears the words "relics of the dead," also in Dwarvish. Any character who examines the skull next to the crooked door recognizes it as that of a mind flayer. The skull crumbles if roughly handled.

There is a crypt haunting here (see "Crypt Hauntings" in the "Crypt Features" section). Fixing the door and removing the mind flayer skull puts the haunt to rest. Repairing the door requires several minutes of work with a relevant set of tools, such as [mason's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/masons-tools.md), as well as proficiency with those tools.

#### P7: Reliquary

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room's floor is covered with broken pedestals, shattered glass, and dust. A headless skeleton rests against the smashed displays. The north wall has collapsed, opening into a larger room beyond.
^2a1

This room was the site of a fierce fight between the mind flayer invaders and the clay golem in the next room. The clay golem ultimately drove off the mind flayers, but not before the mind flayers stole most of the dwarven relics kept here.

The headless skeleton is a mind flayer's, and any character who examines it notes this and the fact that the skeleton matches the skull in area P6.

There is a crypt haunting here (see "Crypt Hauntings" in the "Crypt Features" section). Destroying the headless mind flayer skeleton puts the haunt to rest.

##### Treasure

A metal case containing eight [beads of force](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bead-of-force.md) remains amid the rubble.

#### P8: Honored Dead

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room has a hallway to the north with two rows of standing sarcophagi. Each sarcophagus lid bears a carving of a resting priest. A 10-foot-tall, armored figure with dwarf-like features patrols the room.
^2a4

The figure is a [clay golem](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/clay-golem.md) maintains its vigil here. It is 10 feet tall and shaped to resemble an armored dwarf. Even hundreds of years after it repelled the mind flayer attack, the golem remains vigilant. It pursues foes who flee into areas P6 and P7, but not further.

Each sarcophagus contains the brittle bones of a dwarf. As the mind flayers never bypassed the clay golem guardian and these sarcophagi are farthest from the obelisk fragment that taints the crypt with its magic, these are the only Talhund to remain at rest.

##### Treasure

Each of the fourteen dwarf corpses has a gem worth 100 gp in its ribcage. Any character who steals a gem cannot benefit from the Blessing of Dumathoin described in the "Purifying the Crypt" section earlier in this chapter.

#### P9: Historian's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this room are carved with images of open books. The pages of each are filled with cramped writing. A simple sarcophagus is carved with the image of an older male dwarf holding a quill and a book.
> 
> To the east, a metal lever built into the wall stands in the "up" position. A frail gnome, his shoulders bent with age, ponders the lever.
^2a7

This is the vault of a great dwarf historian and priest, Thorgran Ironquill, who devoted his life to assembling a written history of Dumathoin's works. Thorgran's masterwork, *He of the Hidden Gemstone*, is more fable than history, but his pupils copied the entire text onto the walls of the historian's resting place when they believed he died.

The sarcophagus is empty. Thorgran faked his death to go on one last important journey; the characters can discover the historian's true fate in chapter 7.

##### Lever

The metal lever in the "up" position can be moved only if the lever in area P13 is moved at the same time. Moving both levers simultaneously rotates the hidden sanctum, as described in area P14.

##### Adventurous Gnome

An elderly [svirfneblin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/deep-gnome-svirfneblin.md) named [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) has spent many days in the crypt. Because of his advanced age, his walking speed is 15 feet, and he can't take reactions. [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) ran out of food days ago and is quickly running out of water. If the characters aid him, he shares the following information:

![Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/095-06-010-rivibiddel.webp#center)

- **Ardent Convert.** [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) is a historian and a convert to the religion of Dumathoin.  
- **Getting In.** [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) accessed a secret Underdark passage leading to the pool in area P5. He swam past that room's treacherous inhabitants and was delighted to find the work here on the walls.  
- **Growing Old Rapidly.** [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) was a much physically younger gnome when he entered the crypt to pursue one of the few known copies of He of the Hidden Gemstone. Worried that he'd run out of food and water before recording all the text, [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) scouted the passage to the north and ran afoul of a pair of restless ghosts. Their Horrifying Visage ability aged the unfortunate gnome's body, and he's now hovering on death's door. Weakened and scared, [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) retreated here.  
- **Halfway There.** He has copied the entirety of He of the Hidden Gemstone, but the last half of his copy is in a shaky hand due to his condition. He keeps his work and writing tools in a satchel he always wears.  
- **Ironquill.** [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) knows that the work's author is named Thorgran Ironquill. [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) shares everything about Thorgran listed in the beginning of this section.  
- **Relic.** [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) learned from Thorgran's text that an enormous, exquisite emerald lies somewhere in the Crypt of the Talhund. He wants to recover a chip of this emerald as a sacred relic and return it to other worshipers of Dumathoin before he dies.  
- **Return.** [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) knows he can't survive the difficult swim to leave the way he came. He needs some other route and would be happy to stay in Phandalin for the time being if shown the way.  

Even though [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) has been in areas P5 through P11 only, he shares information about the Crypt of the Talhund from his own scouting and from *He of the Hidden Gemstone*:

- **Blessed Site.** Talhundereth was once a significant holy site for followers of Dumathoin. Generations of their priests, called the Talhund, were buried in the Crypt of the Talhund beneath the temple. The crypt was once one of Dumathoin's most sacred places.  
- **Crypt Invasion.** Many generations ago, mind flayers took over a significant portion of the Underdark, including Talhundereth. They must have invaded the crypt because there are so many restless Undead and haunts. [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) adds, sadly, that the sanctity of the crypt was broken long ago.  
- **Dangers.** There is a hydra and some sort of elemental in the pool to the south, a dangerous golem to the northwest, and some dwarf skeletons and ghosts to the north. [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) believes the entire crypt is filled with deadly dangers.  
- **Emerald.** The massive emerald [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) seeks is likely hidden in an inner sanctum, as befits Dumathoin's lore. Secret doors are common in Dumathoin's holy places. [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) hasn't discovered any in the crypt yet.  
- **Lever.** The lever here in this crypt probably has something to do with revealing the crypt's hidden sanctum, but [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) can't get the lever to move. He's done enough tinkering to realize that the lever is tied to some vast clockwork mechanism that must cause entire rooms in the crypt to shift. The lever is locked in place because it's connected to another lever somewhere else in the crypt. He's convinced that both levers must be pulled at the same time. (If the characters want [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) to help with pulling levers, he's honored to do so, but the crypt guardians may attack him, as described in area P15.)  

#### P10: Founder's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Images of the temple of Talhundereth adorn the walls of this crypt. A sarcophagus in this room bears the carved image of a dwarf woman wearing a large ring.
^2ab

The sarcophagus contains a single [dwarf skeleton](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/dwarf-skeleton-pabtso.md) (see the accompanying stat block). This was the influential priest who first received Dumathoin's vision for Talhundereth and who oversaw its initial construction. As fourteen Talhund assisted her, the number fourteen became important throughout Talhundereth and the crypt.

If the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section), the skeleton remains at rest when the characters enter. Otherwise, the skeleton pushes open the sarcophagus lid to attack when anyone enters. If a character spends an action, invokes the name of Dumathoin, and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, the skeleton stops attacking, though it attacks the characters again if they reenter the room.

##### Treasure

The dwarf skeleton has a gemstone worth 100 gp in its ribcage. The sarcophagus contains the founder's [ring of the orator](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-the-orator-pabtso.md), which fell off her finger when she became a skeleton.

#### P11: Valiant Approach

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room's east wall is bare stone. Carvings of dwarves battling giants, orcs, and other enemies adorn the other walls. A statue of a dwarf warrior, axe raised, stands in the middle of the room.
^2ae

There is a crypt haunting here (see "Crypt Hauntings" in the "Crypt Features" section) that manifests immediately.

Four [dwarf skeletons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/dwarf-skeleton-pabtso.md) (see area P10) lumber from area P12 as soon as anyone enters this room. Two more dwarf skeletons come from area P12 at the start of each subsequent round until all fourteen dwarf skeletons have entered the fray. Any skeletons already in a fight pursue fleeing foes. The skeletons fight until destroyed.

If a character spends an action, invokes the name of Dumathoin, and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, one skeleton stops attacking. The characters can temporarily stop all the skeletons, though all such skeletons attack the characters again if they reenter the room.

Defeating all fourteen skeletons or temporarily stopping them as described above puts this area's haunt to rest.

Words carved above the doorway leading to area P12 read "the valiant dead" in Dwarvish.

##### Sliding Wall

The wall between this room and area P15 is movable. When the levers in areas P9 and P13 are pulled at the same time, the wall lifts into the ceiling, turning areas P11 and P15 into one big room.

##### Treasure

Each of the fourteen dwarf skeletons has a gemstone worth 100 gp in its ribcage. Any character who steals a gem can't benefit from the Blessing of Dumathoin described in the "Purifying the Crypt" section earlier in this chapter.

#### P11a: Narrow Corridor

This long hallway connects areas P5 and P11.

##### Secret Door

Characters who search the corridor's east wall and who succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discover a secret door. Sliding a wall carving of a mountain peak causes the door to swing open to area P4.

#### P12: Valiant Dead

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room has fourteen stone slabs, each with an indentation where a dwarf warrior would rest. The walls are carved with images of valiant dwarf war-priests smiting enemies with glowing axes and blasts of radiant fire.
^2b4

The door to this area is slightly ajar. The fourteen dwarves laid to rest on these slabs animated as skeletons, which the characters faced already in area P11.

#### P13: General's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three slabs with indentations for bodies lie in this room, the central slab more ornate that the other two. Armor scraps and brittle bones rest atop each slab. Carvings show a female dwarf leading other dwarves in battle.
> 
> To the east, a metal lever built into the wall stands in the "up" position.
^2b6

Brelta Gemblade—the dwarf general who was instrumental in securing peace in the region—was laid to rest here, along with her loyal aides, Murnig and Nelja.

The general and both of her aides have returned from the dead as [ghosts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md). If the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section), the ghosts don't manifest when the characters enter the room. Otherwise, the ghosts attack when the characters enter. If a character spends an action, invokes the name of Dumathoin, and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, the ghosts stop attacking.

##### The Lever

The east wall's metal lever can be moved only if the lever in area P9 is moved at the same time. Moving both levers simultaneously rotates the hidden sanctum, as described in area P14.

##### Treasure

Among the bones and armor scraps on each slab is a gemstone worth 100 gp. The general's slab also contains her [mindguard crown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mindguard-crown-pabtso.md).

#### P14: Rotating Sanctum

![Finding the obelisk shard ...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/096-06-011-hidden-obelisk-shard.webp#center "Finding the obelisk shard hidden in the Crypt of the Talhund requires opening a tricky device to access a hidden room")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This round room has three alcoves with exits, each supported by stone pillars and lintels to resemble a mine. The room's center contains a dais with a pedestal that holds an enormous, multifaceted emerald that glows with warm, green light.
^2ba

Three [wraiths](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) manifest and attack as soon as any other creature enters the room. They can't leave the room and fight until destroyed.

##### Rotating the Sanctum

This hidden room is set atop a massive gear. When the characters first arrive in the Crypt of the Talhund, it's not aligned with any of the sanctum access rooms (area P4). When the levers in areas P9 and P13 are both pulled at the same time, the gears grind and the room rotates clockwise. Rotating the room aligns its three entrances with the access rooms and pulls aside the wall between areas P11 and P15, turning those areas into one big room.

##### The Sanctum's Gemstone

The mind flayers found this sacred room and discovered that the 10-foot-diameter gemstone was not an emerald. The green-hued crystal was a dependable receptacle for their psionic echoes, so they imbued it with splinters of their malignant intellects. This desecration is a major reason the crypt remains haunted.

The Talhund blessed the gemstone so that it can't be shattered, but it can be chipped. The svirfneblin [Rivibiddel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rivibiddel-pabtso.md) in area P9 wants a chip of the gemstone at the heart of the sanctum. He doesn't care that it's not a genuine emerald, as its importance to him is religious instead of monetary.

#### P15: Blessed Dead

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room contains fourteen alcoves, each one containing a sarcophagus. The lid of each is carved to depict a pious dwarf priest. A dim radiance emanates from each carving. Slumped in the room's center are six armored skeletons.
^2be

The virtuous souls of the priests interred here weren't affected by the mind flayers' corruption, but the six crypt guardians assigned to watch over the dead were. When a character enters this area, the slumped skeletons rise as six [revenants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/revenant.md) with the following changes:

- They speak Dwarvish only.  
- They have sworn vengeance against all living trespassers in the crypt.  
- They don't rejuvenate if the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section).  

These guardians can't leave the area until the characters rotate the sanctum and the wall between areas P11 and P15 pulls aside. The crypt guardians make their way into the crypt's western half to fight intruders there. If the characters split up to pull the levers in areas P9 and P13, the revenants split up to attack both locations.

If the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section), the guardians' bodies don't rise. Otherwise, the revenants attack the characters on sight.

If a character spends an action, invokes the name of Dumathoin, and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, one revenant stops attacking and returns to its rest. The characters can temporarily stop all the revenants from attacking, though the revenants attack the characters again if the characters reenter the room.

##### Sliding Wall

The wall between this room and area P11 is movable. When the levers in areas P9 and P13 are both pulled at the same time, the wall lifts up into the ceiling, turning areas P11 and P15 into one big room.

#### P16: Haunted Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Lining this hallway are grand carvings of mountain peaks above smaller carvings of multifaceted gemstones.
^2c1

There is a crypt haunting here (see "Crypt Hauntings" in the "Crypt Features" section) that manifests when a creature steps within 5 feet of the door to the architect's tomb (area P17). Defeating the mummy in that room quells the haunt.

The doorway at the north end of this hall is carved with the words "the blessed dead" in Dwarvish. The southern doorway is carved with "the digging dead" in Dwarvish.

##### Secret Door

The secret door in this hallway sits slightly askew in its frame, making it easier to discover than other hidden sanctum entrances. Characters who search the hall and who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discover the secret door. Pressing the carving of a gemstone on the wall causes the door to swing open.

#### P17: Architect's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Architectural designs are carved into the walls of this room, showing the chambers and passages of the crypt. A statue of a glowering dwarf stands protectively over a sarcophagus with a cracked lid.
^2c4

The statue is an old [shield guardian](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md) bound to the crypt's architect, who was buried here with several sheaves of his best architectural plans. The corrupted energies unleashed by the mind flayers bound the designs to the corpse of the dwarf, creating a [mummy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) wrapped in architectural plans. If the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section), the mummy doesn't animate and the statue doesn't move. Otherwise, the mummy pushes off the lid to the sarcophagus and rises to slay intruders, while the shield guardian protects it. The mummy has complete knowledge of the crypt, and might, for example, move through the rotating sanctum (area P14) to intercept characters who flee.

If a character spends an action, invokes the name of Dumathoin, and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, the shield guardian and the mummy stop attacking. The creatures attack the characters again if they reenter the room.

##### Crypt Map

The wall carvings show a complete map of the crypt, including the secret doors, secret areas, and the rotating sanctum. Anyone reviewing this map automatically finds any secret door in the crypt.

##### Treasure

The mummy has a gemstone worth 500 gp hidden in its torso.

#### P18: Obelisk Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is lined with seven carvings of dwarf miners hard at work. A mining cart against the north wall holds a large chunk of black stone about a foot long.
^2c8

![A wizard hid an obelisk fr...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/097-06-012-obelisk-in-mining-cart.webp#center "A wizard hid an obelisk fragment in a mining cart in the Crypt of the Talhund")

The seven carvings are no mere decorations; each covers a burial niche in which a miner-turned-priest was put to rest. These miner-priests were among the most revered of the Talhund, as they had lived the experience of Dumathoin's teachings before hearing the call to join the clergy.

##### Obelisk Fragment

A wizard cast [passwall](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md) to bypass most of the crypt, which allowed them to place the obelisk fragment here in the mining cart for safekeeping. The wizard never returned to claim it. The obelisk fragment has been here for years, amplifying the psychic echoes resonating within the crypt. See the "Obelisk Fragments" section at the beginning of this chapter for more information about the fragment's properties.

When the obelisk fragment is touched, the dwarf spirits within the walls emerge to defend it, unless the characters have put the crypt's haunts to rest (see the "Purifying the Crypt" section). In that case, the spirits don't emerge from the carving.

Initially, four [specters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) emerge from the carvings. At the beginning of each round, another [specter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) emerges from another carving until the fragment is removed from the room or until all seven specters are summoned into the fight.

The specters attack the characters on sight. If a character spends an action, invokes the name of Dumathoin, and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, one specter stops attacking. The characters can temporarily stop all the specters from attacking, though the specters attack the characters again if they reenter the room.

##### If the Characters Fail

If the characters are defeated by the specters, the mind flayer fanatics send minions into the crypt to recover the obelisk fragment. Record if the fanatics get the fragment, as it alters how the characters confront the mind flayer fanatics in chapter 8.

##### Development

Once the characters have explored Talhundereth and the Crypt of the Talhund, they should head to Gibbet Crossing if they haven't done so already.

## Gibbet Crossing

Gibbet Crossing is a forlorn place. It was once a crossroads of the Underdark where drow, duergar, and svirfneblin communities lived in uneasy peace. The duergar had a lucrative business making collapsible cages (their well-crafted hanging cages gave the crossroads its name), and the duergar came to rely on mithral that the svirfneblin supplied. The drow provided the duergar with security in exchange for inclusion in svirfneblin trade contracts, while the drow simultaneously negotiated fair prices for duergar goods. Tensions between the three groups were always present. When mind flayers attacked the area long ago, the groups didn't fight alongside one another and were individually annihilated.

Only monsters live in the crossroads region today. Humanoids rarely travel through the area, as cave-ins and flooding have made it inconvenient as a thoroughfare.

A group of thieves who recently obtained an obelisk fragment came to plunder an abandoned vault in Gibbet Crossing. The obelisk's magic activated a nearby forgotten magic item, trapping the thieves. They died with their treasures.

Recently, the mind flayer fanatics sent one of their most powerful agents, a mind flayer warlock named [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md), to secure the obelisk fragments. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) knows that one of the fragments is hidden somewhere in Gibbet Crossing, and the mind flayer has grimlock minions searching for it.

Reaching Gibbet Crossing is normally a daunting affair, as Underdark dangers deter most travelers. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) has killed or driven away the dangerous creatures that normally lurk in the area so the grimlocks can come and go with ease. The dangers of Gibbet Crossing itself have proven harder to uproot, but [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) has an idea where the obelisk fragment is located, so the mind flayer hasn't needed to clear the old crossroads.

When the characters travel to Gibbet Crossing, it's up to you whether they face any random Underdark monsters or threats. Narrating the daunting journey to this subterranean area could be just as effective as running random encounters.

### Gibbet Crossing Features

Gibbet Crossing consists of three areas separated by wide, natural tunnels smoothed for easier travel. The duergar workshop is to the west, the svirfneblin enclave is to the northeast, and the drow trading halls are to the southeast.

#### Illumination

[Continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells still illuminate the natural tunnels after many years, but the chambers are unlit and the current denizens rely on [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) to see. Descriptions of unlit areas assume that the characters have a light source or some other method of seeing in the dark.

#### Doors

Doors throughout Gibbet Crossing are made of 2-inch-thick slabs of stone. Any door opening into a natural tunnel has grooves to place a reinforcing bar, but the bars are nowhere to be found, except in the passage to Talhundereth (area G11).

#### Ceilings

Ceilings in the svirfneblin enclave (areas G11 to G14) are 9 feet high. Ceilings in the rest of Gibbet Crossing are 10 feet high, unless the text states otherwise.

### Gibbet Crossing Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.5.

#### G1: Surface Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A few lumps of old slag and tumbled stone are all that remain in this large room. Words are carved into a double door that leads south. Doors also exit to the east and west; the one to the west bears a large "X" in dark red.
^2d3

The tunnel from the surface winds down through the earth for more than a mile. The deepest point is a cave-in that collapsed the back wall of this room.

The words on the door leading south to the workshop repeat "toil" in Dwarvish.

Previous explorers have taken everything of value from this room. The painted red mark is intended to indicate a safe exit door, although the characters might interpret it differently.

#### G2: Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shelves and racks in this storeroom hold iron bars of various lengths.
^2d5

The heavy bars were raw materials for the duergar workshop, left here once the duergar started relying on mithral from their svirfneblin neighbors. The bars are badly rusted and valueless. If a dwarf character or a character proficient in the [History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History) skill inspects the bars, they identify markings indicating they are of duergar make. A character proficient in [History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History) also realizes the duergar clan that once used these marks is long gone, overwhelmed by mind flayers many generations ago.

#### G3: Cage Workshop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stamps and lathes line the walls of this large workshop. Four eerie figures toil before a dark forge, striking metal that isn't there. Several stone tables bear old tools and metal rods adorned with spikes. A cage in the southeast corner bears inward-pointing spikes.
^2d7

Four [feral ashenwights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/feral-ashenwight-pabtso.md) are bound to the workshop in which they worked while alive. They attack trespassers and fight until destroyed.

This workshop was used to create metal cages of various sizes, all adorned with wicked spikes pointing inward and outward, or both. Cunning hinges and reinforced pins make these cages easy to fold for transport when empty. The duergar ran a moderately successful business selling these macabre cages, but their business reached new heights when they started incorporating lightweight mithral into their folding cages.

##### Treasure

The fully assembled cage in the corner is a finished example. It can be folded flat with 1 minute of work. It weighs 50 pounds. Although much of the cage is made of iron, it has reinforcing bars and hinges made of mithral. The cage doesn't have a lock; customers paid extra for locks manufactured elsewhere. The cage is worth 200 gp.

#### G4: Living Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several short, iron bed frames are jumbled together in this room. Nothing remains of any bedding. An opening to the south leads to an alcove containing only two long tables and a splintered chair.
> 
> To the west, a door bearing a painted red "X" opens to a long hallway that leads deeper into the crossing.
^2da

Ashes and burn marks on the floor indicate past campfires. Remains of wooden chairs in the alcove to the south appear to have been broken up for firewood.

The long hallway to the west includes doors to the showroom (area G5) and the depleted mine (area G9).

##### Treasure

A shredded backpack contains a set of [cartographer's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-tools.md), six [pints of oil](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-flask.md), an illustrated book about ropers, an emerald worth 250 gp, and a [lantern of revealing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/lantern-of-revealing.md).

#### G5: Showroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is empty, but crumbling wall carvings show a duergar unfolding a spiked cage step by step.
^2dd

The duergar would show off collapsible cages to prospective purchasers in this room. The chain devil in the adjacent prison (area G6) comes here to investigate any sounds of intruders.

#### G6: Prison

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two spiked cages are jammed with old bones and bits of decaying flesh. A woman with red skin wrapped in loose chains sits on the floor.
^2df

Duergar diabolists bound a [chain devil](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md) to this room long ago. She dimly remembers her name is Vakketar. When the mind flayers routed the duergar, they blasted Vakketar's mind and left her for dead. The chain devil survived, however, as did the magic that binds her here. She can leave this area for only 1 minute at a time before the binding magic compels her to return.

Vakketar used to demonstrate the efficacy of the cages for customers, usually on captured thieves or duergar who worked too slowly. She might talk briefly with the characters, but only as a pretense to determine their numbers and weaknesses. She can't comprehend the passage of time except with extraordinary concentration.

An ageless and sadistic jailer, Vakketar likes to catch intruders and shove them into the spiked cages. She has captured many curious travelers over the years and tries to capture the characters, too.

##### Treasure

Both cages are like the ones in area G3, except they are sized for Large creatures. Once emptied of bones and gore, each can be folded flat with 2 minutes of work and weighs 500 pounds. Neither cage has a lock because Vakketar would wrap her animated chains around the cage doors to keep them closed. Each cage is worth 400 gp.

#### G7: Stairs to Flooded Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This wide passage is inlaid with roughly cut stairs that descend into murky flood waters.
^2e2

A subterranean waterway flooded this passage several decades ago, and it's now completely submerged. Part of the tunnel has collapsed, creating an opening to the negotiation chamber (area G16).

#### G8: Intersection

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stalactites hang from the ceiling of this 30-foot-high, vaulted cavern. The floor is slick with moisture, and it's carved level and even. Passages extend in several directions, and a stone double door bearing the carving of a spiked cage is set into one wall.
^2e4

A [grick alpha](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/grick-alpha.md) recently moved into this area and is coiled around one of the eastern stalactites, where it can easily slither down the nearby wall to snag prey. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the grick, which attacks when noticed. The first time it is injured, the grick emits a loud squeal that draws the gricks lairing in the mine (area G9) to its aid. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md)'s grimlocks know to avoid the grick when they come this way on errands.

Although the days when this intersection was a bustling market are gone, it resonates with faint psychic echoes of traders and travelers conducting business. Characters who enter this area hear momentary auditory hallucinations of this ancient business.

#### G9: Depleted Mine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rough walls indicate that mining was once performed here. Clots of repulsive mucus jam the crevasses. A narrow door is wedged into the back of the mine.
^2e6

Six [gricks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/grick.md) lair here amid the nests they've made from their own mucus. The characters might have already encountered them if the grick alpha in the adjacent intersection squealed for aid.

The duergar initially tried to mine metal for their cage workshop here, but they soon learned the svirfneblin provided better product. The door at the rear of the mine was installed later as an escape route that let many duergar flee the mind flayers during the attack.

#### G10: Collapsed Tunnel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The wide tunnel ends suddenly around this bend. Large chunks of stone suggest a long-ago collapse.
^2e8

![Ropers lurk amid the ruined mine tunnels](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/100-06-013-roper.webp#center)

Two [ropers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md) lurk amid the stones here. They enjoy ambushing travelers, but there haven't been many travelers recently. The ropers don't know that gricks have been poaching their potential prey. They're hungry and desperate for victims.

The ropers know about the strange effect in the adjacent receiving room (area G12). Once one roper is defeated, the other one retreats just inside the doorway of the receiving room to gain the protection that room provides.

The long-ago collapse caused desperate times for the svirfneblin enclave. The tunnel once led to several other svirfneblin communities from which these svirfneblin acquired mithral, but the collapse proved too extensive for even the skilled tunnelers to safely excavate. The isolated svirfneblin began to rely on traders from Talhundereth to get mithral, even though this cut deeply into their profits.

##### Treasure

Each roper has consumed four amethysts, each worth 30 gp. The xorn in area G14 is desperate to recover these amethysts.

#### G11: Talhundereth Passage

Breaking into this room from area G10 is difficult, as the door is barred. A character can remove the bar from the other side by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md), or by succeeding on a DC 21 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to shove the door hard enough to break the bar. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) rightly believes a passage to Talhundereth is behind the door, so the mind flayer sent grimlocks to investigate. The door bears marks from [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md)'s grimlocks. The ropers from area G10 ate the grimlocks before they could get through the door.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An irregular tunnel leads from a fissure to the north to a reinforced door to the south.
^2eb

The fissure at the north end of this room leads to area T1 in Talhundereth (see map 6.3). The svirfneblin worked hard to limit this access to Talhundereth and kept watch here. They weren't expecting a mind flayer attack from Talhundereth and were quickly dispatched.

#### G12: Receiving Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A double door in the northwest corner of this room has been knocked off its hinges and lies on the floor. The room is blurry, as though seen underwater.
^2ed

This room's blurry appearance is the result of a permanent magical effect from when the mind flayers burst into this room and slaughtered the svirfneblin. The gnomes cast [blur](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blur.md) as a last-ditch effort, and their magic soaked into the room, making everything within it harder to see. Attacks against creatures or objects in the room have disadvantage unless the attacker doesn't rely on sight, as with [blindsight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight), or can see through illusions, as with [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#truesight).

#### G13: Private Rooms

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Half a dozen rough chambers along an L-shaped passage remain mostly intact. Each chamber contains a pair of short stone beds and an empty metal footlocker.
^2ef

The svirfneblin stationed at this outpost shared rooms. Anyone stepping into one of these rooms has a momentary flash of dread, as though being awoken by a warning of an ambush occurring nearby. This is a psychic remnant from the mind flayer attack.

#### G14: Toppled Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The east side of this room bears a strange, angled structure, as though a squat tower tipped sideways and fell through the wall. Muddy knobs protrude and retract from its irregular surface in a slow, hypnotic motion. Near the structure, two rocky creatures and a three-legged, three-armed, egg-shaped monster with a wide maw on its head chatter in a grunting language.
^2f1

A [xorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/xorn.md) named Zoklork lairs here with two [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md). They are discussing the tower in Terran.

##### Toppled Tower

The strange tower is a variant of [Daern's instant fortress](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/daerns-instant-fortress.md) called a [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md). Svirfneblin scouts liberated the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) from enemies deeper in the Underdark and hid it in this enclave until they could decide what to do with it. They never figured out how to activate it.

The erratic magic of the nearby Netherese obelisk fragment caused the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) to grow and tip through the natural stone between the gnome enclave and the drow treasure vault. Wedged in the earth this way, the tower is immune to all damage. Without the command word, the only way to shrink it again is to sprinkle a handful of gravel from a [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) creature upon it.

![Mudslick Tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/101-06-014-mudslick-tower.webp#center)

##### Talking with Zoklork

Zoklork has spent a lot of time around svirfneblin and speaks Gnomish and Undercommon as well as Terran. If the characters parley with the elementals or Zoklork, the xorn can share the following information:

- **Amethysts.** Zoklork came here a few years ago with their "rockmate"—akin to a xorn sibling—in search of delicious amethysts the svirfneblin left behind. The earth elementals were already here; like Zoklork, they find the ever-shifting mud of the toppled tower strangely fascinating.  
- **Greedy Mate.** Zoklork's rockmate found and ate all the amethysts, even though Zoklork was clear about wanting a share.  
- **Gutted.** The rockmate lumbered from the enclave and into a roper ambush. The ropers killed and ate Zoklork's rockmate, including the amethysts in the rockmate's gut.  
- **Revenge.** Zoklork is angry at the ropers and really wants those amethysts back.  
- **Tower.** If the characters give Zoklork the amethysts, or if the characters killed the ropers but didn't recover the amethysts, the xorn considers it a great favor and shares a secret about the odd tower: it's a rare magic item from the Plane of Earth that seems to have been accidentally activated (Zoklork doesn't know about the obelisk fragment). The [mudslick tower's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) command word can be used to shrink it; the command word is "petrification" in Terran.  
- **Withdrawn.** Zoklork isn't willing to scout for the characters because dangerous creatures lurk nearby.  

If the characters don't learn how to shrink the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) from Zoklork, they can learn its command word with an [identify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md) spell or by perusing the notes in the drow shrine (area G20).

If the characters shrink the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md), whether with [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) gravel or its command word, the path opens between the killing hall (area G23) and the vault to the east (area G25). If the characters haven't yet dealt with [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md), the mind flayer and associated grimlocks relocate from the guard room (area G24) to the vault.

##### Treasure

In addition to the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md), this room contains a strongbox with 1,300 gp inside.

#### G15: Duergar Delegate Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long, low table in this room bears bits of metal. Stairs descend to the south, beneath an archway bearing deep, jagged carvings.
^2f6

Drow and duergar living in this area didn't trust each other but realized the benefits of working together to obtain greater profits from their wares. This is the room where duergar prepared for negotiations with drow. The metal pieces on the table are hinges from the duergar folding cages, which they'd intended to show off.

The carving above the archway reads "trust no one" in Dwarvish.

#### G16: Negotiating Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is flooded with two feet of dark water. The crumbled remains of an old stone table emerge just above the waterline. Four enormous, crab-like monsters skulk around the room.
^2f8

The water makes this room difficult terrain for creatures without a swimming speed. Four [chuuls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) lurk here, alert for prey entering from any direction. They know about the secret door in the south wall (see below), but they also know that a dangerous creature is beyond it. They don't pass through the secret door unless they can chase foes that way.

##### Secret Door

Drow priests often spied on the negotiations from behind this secret door. A character who searches the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds the door, which opens by shifting a sliding panel. Behind the door is a staircase that ascends to area G20. Opening the secret door causes water to submerge the bottom 2 feet of the stairway.

#### G17: Drow Delegation Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two feet of water pools in this room. Rusted metal chair frames jut from the water, and delicate script is carved above the doorway leading east.
^2fb

The metal frames used to be comfortable chairs, but everything other than the frames has rotted away.

The carved script reads "distrust all strangers" in Elvish.

#### G18: Drow Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Natural stone stairs descend into a passageway flooded with dark water. The upper half of a door protrudes above the water on the west side of the passage.
^2fd

This wide passage leads to territory in the Underdark once claimed by drow. Two drow trading houses kept outposts on each side of the passage (areas G19 and G21).

The lowest point of this passage is flooded with dark water about 2 feet deep.

#### G19: Azfadiel Receiving Room

The door leading from the wide tunnel bears a symbol of a coin with spider legs and the name "Azfadiel" in Elvish. A character who is proficient in the [History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History) skill, or who is a drow, remembers that House Azfadiel was a drow trading house that was exterminated by mind flayers generations ago.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This wide room has several chairs made of tough silk over metal frames. Against the west wall stands a metal cabinet adorned with symbols of coins crawling on spider legs.
^2ff

When the mind flayers attacked, the drow denizens moved the large, empty metal cabinet in front of the door to the shrine (area G20) to hide it. This ruse worked; the mind flayers never entered the shrine or found the yochlol demon bound to protect it.

Moving the metal cabinet out of the way is necessary to open the shrine door, although the yochlol from area G20 can seep under the door and the cabinet in mist form.

Everything here is much cleaner and better maintained than other areas of Gibbet Crossing.

#### G20: Azfadiel Shrine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Coins on spider legs creep along webbing that covers the ceiling of this room. A table stands against a stairway descending to the north. Against the south wall, a marble altar has a noticeable indentation. Near the altar is a monocular creature with a body that resembles melted yellow wax.
^301

The [yochlol](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) Zuluthl was summoned by the priests of House Azfadiel, and it has remained here ever since. The demon knows that the Azfadiel drow here were killed a long time ago, but the fight was over too quickly for the yochlol to join. Although Zuluthl doesn't need to remain here, the yochlol considers itself on an extended break from the chaotic machinations of the Demonweb Pits. It enjoys the solitude and reacts violently to intruders.

##### Command Word

The table contains several slate tablets filled with notes in Undercommon. Reviewing them reveals that the writer was eavesdropping on conversations between duergar and drow. Apart from dull trade information about sharing resources to get more money from traveling customers, the duergar were seeking a command word to activate a magical stone tower. The drow claimed ignorance. The notes indicate that the drow already researched the command word and were separately negotiating with the nearby svirfneblin about sharing it with them. The drow hoped to be paid twice for the same command word. Characters who spend at least 10 minutes reading the notes find a drawing of a tower with the Terran word for "petrification" written under it. The characters should be able to determine that this is the [mudslick tower's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) command word once they've examined the tower in area G14.

##### Treasure

The spiders creeping through the webbing are mundane coins enchanted by the yochlol. If removed from this room, they revert to ordinary coins. There are 80 gp in total here. In addition, on top of the altar is a [spell scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-4th-level.md) of [freedom of movement](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/freedom-of-movement.md).

#### G21: Receiving Room

The double door leading from the wide tunnel has a stylized symbol of a dagger thrust into a metal ingot and the name "Triestoroth" in Elvish. A character proficient in the [History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History) skill remembers that House Triestoroth was a wealthy drow trading house exterminated by mind flayers generations ago. Many people believe that House Triestoroth had undiscovered treasures hidden in well-defended vaults.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Steps lead from a double door into a room flooded with several inches of water. Lifelike but heavily damaged statues are pushed against the walls of the room. A few sodden nests made of rubbish sit atop the old tables, giving the room a dreadful reek. Milling near the nests are two squat, lizard-like creatures with eight legs each and five gray-skinned Humanoids.
^305

Five [grimlocks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md) live here, keeping watch on the doors and resting from their interminable excavations in the hall to the north. They keep two [basilisks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/basilisk.md) as pets. The grimlocks can't be [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) by the basilisks.

The door leading west is cool to the touch, due to the brown mold growing on the other side of it.

##### Statues

The six statues pushed into the corners are two dwarves, a drow, two quaggoths, and a basilisk that saw its own reflection. Each is extraordinarily lifelike and caught in an expression of surprise or fear. Other than the basilisk, these are [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) Underdark travelers who ran afoul of [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) and the mind flayer's minions. The grimlocks disfigured each statue enough to prevent the victims from being restored to life.

The characters can acquire a handful of gravel from the smashed statues to shrink the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) if they've learned to do so.

#### G22: Moldy Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This once-opulent dining room is flooded with more than a foot of dark water. Metal rods that once held tapestries now support sheets of mold. Six chairs surround a large table. A moldy brown crust has formed on the water in one corner.
^308

A 10-foot-wide patch of mold to the south is [brown mold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/brown-mold.md) (see the "Dungeon Hazards" section of the "Dungeon Master's Guide") and has chilled the water enough to create a thin crust of ice.

#### G23: Killing Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Narrow slits line the west side of this twisting hall.
^30a

The arrow slits provide three-quarters cover to creatures in area G24.

[Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) and the grimlock minions have occupied the adjacent guard room for the past few weeks. The grimlocks are likely to hear or smell intruders in the hall through the arrow slits. The grimlocks don't have ranged weapons, but [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) might attack through the narrow openings.

##### Blocked Hall

The top of the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) blocks the end of this hall except for gaps only a few inches wide between the battlements along the toppled tower's roof. It churns with muddy knobs that emerge and collapse into the tower, just like the tower's base in area G14. Two [grimlocks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md) diligently work to batter their way through the tower. They've made no progress, as any lapse in their work allows the tower to magically repair the damage. They don't stop their work unless enemies get close.

##### If the Tower Is Gone

If the characters have already shrunk the [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) and opened the way to the vault, the grimlocks here and all the denizens of area G24 have relocated to the vault (area G25). There, [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) studies the obelisk fragment to determine how to best help the mind flayer fanatics.

#### G24: Guard Room

![Qunbraxel, leader of the g...](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/phandelver-and-below-the-shattered-obelisk/img/102-06-015-qunbraxel.webp#center "Qunbraxel, leader of the grimlocks in Gibbet Crossing, sits on a throne")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The east wall of this room bears several arrow slits. The south wall contains an enormous map drawn in charcoal, with numerous arrows and annotations. A stone throne sits against the west wall.
^30e

[Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) (see the accompanying stat block) is an arrogant mind flayer warlock. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) is either seated on the stone throne or reviewing the intricate map drawn on the wall. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) is always attended by four loyal [grimlocks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md). They swap this duty with other grimlocks nearby, although [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) can hardly be bothered to tell one grimlock minion from another.

[Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) uses the grimlocks as front-line combatants. While [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) fights, the mind flayer telepathically berates the characters with dire warnings and predictions such as the following:

- "The ritual will devastate Phandalin! You bear witness to the rise of a new illithid empire on the surface!"  
- "There is power in the Far Realm for those daring enough to seize it. And I dare!"  
- "The chosen ones are preparing the ritual while you natter about!"  
- "The obelisk fragments will bolster the ritual, and I will join the chosen ones when my minions deliver the fragments!" If the characters tell the mind flayer that they've already secured one or more obelisk fragments, [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) responds, "No matter! I shall add those that I can recover to the goblins' fragments, and my place among the chosen ones is assured!"  
- "Those you care about in Phandalin will be transformed into illithids—if they survive at all!  
- As the mind flayer is defeated, [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) boasts, "The ritual can't be stopped. The chosen ones know all about you. The Far Realm will twist your body and shatter your sanity!"  

##### The Ilvaash Fanatics' Mission

The mind flayer fanatics manipulated the insufferably arrogant [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) with vague promises to bring [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) into their inner circle. Cut off from any elder brain [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) considers worthy, the mind flayer hopes to join the Ilvaash fanatics and receive power and insight from the Far Realm.

The mind flayer fanatics had little intent on welcoming [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) into their fold, but they've been happy to exploit the sycophant's efforts. They told [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) to relocate to Gibbet Crossing because it was near Phandalin. They hoped [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) would acquire the fragments, but [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) was more interested in establishing a court of grimlocks and turning Gibbet Crossing into a lair. Once the Sawplee goblins succeeded at finding the obelisk shards in Phandalin, the fanatics commanded [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) to hurry with collecting the rest of the obelisk fragments.

[Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) guessed that the nearby fragment was somehow connected to the toppled tower that's blocking the way to the old drow vault. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) ordered the grimlocks to bash through it, determined to eventually overcome the tower's regenerative protections. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) isn't aware of the [mudslick tower's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md) nature, or even that it's a magic item wedged into the stone.

[Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) is less certain about the locations of the other fragments. The mind flayer knows the Sawplee goblins acquired the smaller fragments scattered throughout Phandalin. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) believes a fragment in Talhundereth is guarded by an encephalon cluster, as the mind flayer has caught psychic glimpses of the creature. [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) knows another is in the crypt beneath Talhundereth but doesn't yet know where in the crypt to find it.

##### The Map

The map drawn on the wall shows the obelisk reassembled with all seven parts. Three stylized mind flayers surround it, sequestered in an underground stronghold deep beneath Phandalin that is labeled "Illithinoch."

Wavy lines emanate up from these mind flayers to a sketch of Phandalin, miles above Illithinoch. Tiny Humanoid figures in the town that are touched by the wavy lines appear to be transforming into mind flayers. Several mathematical formulas calculate the percentage of people who will transform into mind flayers. Variables in this equation produce different outcomes, from as few as three in ten to as many as seven in ten people transforming into mind flayers. The ritual painfully kills anyone who doesn't transform. If the characters haven't already figured it out, share the information in the "The Sinister Truth" and "The Ritual" sections at the beginning of the chapter.

#### G25: Drow Vault

If [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) and the grimlocks relocated to this vault, the grimlocks are happily picking their teeth with bones while [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) examines the obelisk fragment.

The bones are the remains of three drow thieves. They discovered the obelisk fragment on their way to plunder this vault. The magic churning in the obelisk fragment proved to be their doom, however, as it activated the nearby [mudslick tower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mudslick-tower-pabtso.md), blocking the vault's only exit. Unable to batter through the stone tower, the thieves starved to death amid the treasures they sought.

##### Obelisk Fragment

The obelisk fragment rests near the pile of bones. See the "Obelisk Fragments" section at the beginning of this chapter for more information about the fragment's properties.

##### Treasure

Each drow thief had a set of [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) that is still intact. The shelves here contain 5,900 gp, 14,050 sp, a jeweled [dagger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md) worth 200 gp, eleven jacinths worth 90 gp each, a [wand of magic detection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-magic-detection.md), and a [Heward's handy haversack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hewards-handy-haversack.md).

##### If the Characters Fail

If the characters are routed from this room before acquiring the obelisk fragment, [Qunbraxel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/qunbraxel-pabtso.md) or other servants of the fanatics immediately remove the obelisk fragment. Record if this happens, as it alters how the characters confront the mind flayer fanatics in chapter 8.

## What's Next?

In the best case scenario, the characters recover all three obelisk fragments and put the dangers in the Starmetal Hills to rest.

Yet there are still leads for the characters to pursue. The characters haven't found any more missing townspeople. Perhaps more concerning, they've learned about the mind flayer fanatics lurking deeper underground in a place called Illithinoch, and the characters now know how to get there.

In any case, the characters' next step is to return to Phandalin to rest and learn what they can about the mind flayer fanatics.

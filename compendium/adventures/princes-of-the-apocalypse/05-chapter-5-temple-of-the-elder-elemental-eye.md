# Chapter 5: Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, p. 112* 

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/053-poa05-01.webp#center)

The struggle to defeat the forces of Elemental Evil is coming to a head. Characters have cleared out the cult's surface outposts and taken the fight to the temples beneath the Sumber Hills. Below the ancient dwarven stronghold of Tyar-Besil is a deeper and even older maze of dark caverns—the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye. This area consists of the Fane of the Eye and the four elemental nodes from which the cults draw their power.

The elemental nodes are growing so strong that their mere existence is triggering catastrophes. Little investigation is to be done at this point; the cultists' plans are clear. The big question is whether the characters can contain the damage. Time is pressing, and the party might have to make hard choices.

> [!note] Character Advancement
> 
> If the party cleaned out each of the temples in chapter 4, the adventurers begin this chapter around 10th level. The Fane of the Eye is intended for a 10th-level group; the Howling Caves are designed for an 11th-level party; the Plunging Torrents and Black Geode are intended for a party of about 12th level; and the Weeping Colossus is designed for a 13th-level party. As a rough guideline, the party should gain one level after clearing the Fane, one level after finishing the first elemental node they explore, and one more level after completing the third node they explore.
^character-advancement

## Wrath of the Elements

The elemental prophets sense that they are running out of time, and they redouble their efforts to expand Elemental Evil's power across the Dessarin Valley. If they can't subdue the area with [devastation orbs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/devastation-orb-pota.md), the prophets tear open rifts to the elemental planes so that nothing can resist the elemental power.

The characters must contain the damage. Each time the characters retreat from the Fane of the Eye or finish exploring an elemental node, run one of the encounters from among "Downpour," "Burning Hills," and "Tortured Earth."

In addition, two new threats establish themselves in the area. Haayon the Punisher threatens Beliard, while Westbridge gives in to the Counsel of Despair. The adventurers might receive word of these situations, or the party might stumble across them.

### Downpour

If the water node is still active, a torrential downpour begins while the adventurers are traveling in the Sumber Hills. This torrent lasts for 12 hours, producing an immense amount of rain, wind, and lightning. The downpour has the following principal effects:

- The adventurers can't finish a long rest unless they are indoors.  
- All overland travel takes twice as long.  
- Vision is heavily obscured past 100 feet.  
- The DC to avoid becoming lost increases to 15.  

You can present the characters with unexpected obstacles related to the storm to convey the idea that conditions are worsening in the Dessarin Valley.

### Burning Hills

Use this event only if the fire node is still active. The characters find themselves—and perhaps a settlement they care about—in the path of three [fire elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) and five [smoke mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/smoke-mephit.md). The elementals go for the nearest large combustible objects, while the smoke mephits scatter and use their cinder breath to start small peripheral fires.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The smell of smoke drifts on the air. Upwind, plumes of smoke billow up from the hillsides. Grass is catching fire at a furious rate, and the fire is moving quickly your way. Big creatures made of flame race over the ground, while small shapes flit in the smoke.
^450

The adventurers detect the fire when it is 500 feet away. It covers a front of about 200 feet. At the start of each round, the fire advances `2d6 × 10` feet. Smoke renders the fire's area, and 100 feet ahead of it, lightly obscured. A creature that enters the fire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes `1d10` fire damage. If the creature isn't immune to fire and needs to breathe, it must also succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) from smoke inhalation until the start of its next turn.

### Tortured Earth

If the earth node is still active, one of the tremors wracking the Dessarin Valley strikes almost under the party's feet. The effect is like that created by an [earthquake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md) spell, but the area's radius is 1,000 feet. The saving throw DC is 15.

As the tremor ends, a [young purple worm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/young-purple-worm-pota.md) with 184 hit points (challenge rating 13) burrows out of the ground. Driven into a frenzy by the quake, it attacks other living creatures nearby. It retreats rather than perishing in combat.

### Counsel of Despair

Seeing no end to the destruction visited on their homes, a cowardly faction among the elders of Westbridge submits to the forces of elemental earth. They hope to be spared further sorrow and destruction. Characters learn of this development from Sedina Wolfpaw, a half-elf [scout](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) from Triboar who visited Westbridge, discovered the situation, and hurried to track down anyone who could help. She introduces the problem as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Westbridge was badly damaged by earthquakes. I was down that way, and I found half the town gathered in front of the Harvest Inn. Most of them were listening to a priest in stony armor. He was preaching about how destruction was coming, and only the chosen would be spared, and they were listening to him!" She shakes her head. "When I tried to speak up, the priest told the townies to seize me, but I managed to escape. I knew I had to find someone who can fight these lunatics, so here I am."
^453

Sedina is happy to accompany the party to Westbridge. Otherwise, she continues on her way.

#### Arrival in Westbridge

When the adventurers reach Westbridge, their reception depends on the manner of their arrival.

##### Direct Approach

Characters who come into town openly are met by a haggard orchardist named Jendon (a human [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), who wears a cloak with a brown patch made of the same fabric as the robes the earth cultists wear. Jendon tries to persuade the adventurers to leave, explaining that, "We don't have any choice. The earth priests are the only ones who can save us now."

Jendon isn't evil. He just doesn't see any evidence that so-called "heroes" have managed to stop the catastrophes ravaging the area. Jendon knows some might call him a coward, but he is convinced that submission to the forces of elemental earth is what any rational person would do.

##### Clandestine Arrival

If the characters try to slip into town without being spotted, they quickly meet a bowyer named Reetha (a human [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). She wants nothing to do with the Black Earth cult and despairs that her neighbors knuckled under to the cultists. Reetha tells the characters that most townspeople are just scared, and that cultists have taken over the Harvest Inn.

#### New Converts

The adventurers find the cult already at work.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Much of Westbridge lies in ruins. A handful of people are out and about, but they keep to themselves. Several dozen more townsfolk have gathered in a clearing. They each wear a brown patch on their cloaks or tunics as they stand listening to a trio of hooded priests who are leading them in strange prayer to "the Black Earth."
^458

The three hooded priests are junior members of the Black Earth cult ([cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md)) who are enjoying haranguing the forty or so [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) undergoing indoctrination. The cultists taunt any characters who approach, saying, "These people have learned the truth. You can't save them, but we can."

The Westbridgers are [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). They don't like the cultists, but they think they need the cult's protection against future disasters. Some beg the characters not to interfere, while others take the adventurers' arrival as reason to stand up to the cult. If fighting breaks out here, most of the commoners scatter, but six aid the adventurers. These braver folk warn the characters that the "high priest," Dreyon, is at the Harvest Inn and has a hill giant in his service.

#### The Harvest Inn

Dreyon, the leader of the cult contingent occupying Westbridge, is a [Black Earth priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/black-earth-priest-pota.md). Two [Black Earth guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/black-earth-guard-pota.md), a [hill giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) named Lomm, and a gang of six [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) aid him. (See chapter 7 for the cultists' statistics.) The group has taken over the Harvest Inn. Lomm sleeps in the stable he has emptied of livestock.

Herivin Dardragon, the halfling proprietor, remains on the premises, along with four of his staff (human [commoners](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). They are little better than poorly treated servants desperately trying to keep up with the hill giant's appetite. Herivin and his staff want the villains dead.

When confronted, Dreyon orders the commoners to drive out the characters. If that fails, he then tries to use the Westbridgers as living shields.

### Haayon the Punisher

This encounter occurs only after the prophets of the Cult of the Howling Hatred and the Cult of the Crushing Wave have been defeated. Bands of raiders roaming the area, minor outposts and lairs far from the Haunted Keeps, and survivors of the party's attacks are scattered and leaderless without direction. New leaders arise to gather the dispersed cultists and reestablish the defeated temples; one such leader is Haayon the Punisher.

Haayon is a cloud giant who hopes to become the next leader of the air cult. Late to answer the call of Elemental Evil, he recently arrived in the Dessarin Valley to discover the cult broken. The cloud giant believes the air cultists were defeated because they were weak, so he imposes a brutal regime of self-denial and atonement on surviving cultists.

Given time, Haayon might very well rebuild the Cult of the Howling Hatred. He knows little of what's happening underground, though he's extensively questioning each cultist he encounters. In his arrogance, he sees the existence of fleeing cultists as proof that new leadership is needed.

#### The Punished

Through rumors in a town or messages from faction members, the characters hear the following tale. For the description, choose a settlement the characters aren't in and that has not been destroyed.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Refugees have been shuffling down from the hills north of the town. Some wear the white robes and black-feathered cowls of air cultists, while others are dressed in the green of the water cultists. Each person bears a placard around his or her neck, reading "I am punished."
^45c

The refugees are [cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) who fled the defeats at the Haunted Keeps and the elemental temples, but then got rounded up by Haayon. Those who Haayon finds worthy are welcomed into his camp. The unworthy are marked with placards and sent away. Only the rejected cultists know where Haayon's camp is.

#### Haayon's Camp

The giant's band has gathered at a hilltop ruin in the hills overlooking Jundar's Pass, where the road leads northeast from Beliard. When the adventurers locate the camp, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A footpath leads to a ruined stone wall that rings a hilltop. A dozen tents are pitched in the shelter of the walls, along with a pavilion. At one side of the camp, five slumped figures are tied to wooden posts, each captive with a placard around his or her neck. Silent figures in leather breeches stand guard.
^45e

Five [Crushing Wave reavers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/crushing-wave-reaver-pota.md) and a [Howling Hatred priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/howling-hatred-priest-pota.md) wearing a [balloon pack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/balloon-pack-pota.md) watch the outer camp. (See chapter 7 for the cultists' statistics and rules for the [balloon pack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/balloon-pack-pota.md).) The figures tied to the posts are five air and water cultists. Each has 1 hit point remaining and wears a wooden placard that reads, "I am punished."

Haayon the [cloud giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md), two [Feathergale knights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/feathergale-knight-pota.md) (see chapter 7), and six loyal [cultists](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) gather inside the pavilion. Behind the pavilion are two [hippogriffs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hippogriff.md) that serve the knights as mounts. The giant and his minions hear any fighting that breaks out in the outer part of the camp but don't join the fray until their turns during the fourth round.

##### Roleplaying Haayon

If the characters approach peacefully and with a plausible story, Haayon is willing to hear them out. If they ask about the punished cultists, the giant justifies their humiliation by saying they're weak. If they serve as a warning to others, all the better.

Haayon is a patient and perceptive listener. He is committed to forcing any newcomers to join his group. Such initiates must subject themselves to his judgment. If the adventurers refuse, Haayon says, "Consent isn't necessary for judgment. Lack of it proves punishment is required." He then gives the signal to attack.

#### Treasure

Haayon's pavilion contains two large wooden chests filled with the valuables he has confiscated from those who failed his judgment. The chests holds 260 gp, a pouch with six citrines worth 60 gp each, and another pouch containing two [potions of flying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-flying.md) .

## Fighting the Prophets

After the characters defeat one prophet, the remaining three prophets receive visions that encourage them to retreat to the caverns below Tyar-Besil. One prophet of your choice relocates to the Fane of the Eye. That villain can be found in area F21, beseeching the Elder Elemental Eye for aid. The other two prophets relocate to their elemental nodes and begin to summon their respective Princes of Elemental Evil. The adventurers interrupt the first prophet they encounter in a node. The second successfully summons his or her patron just as the characters arrive.

## Saving the Delegates

A few delegates from Mirabar and their possessions remain to be found:

- Deseyna Norvael is in the Howling Caves (area N17).  
- [Rhundorth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rhundorth-pota.md) is in the Black Geode (area G15).  
- Teresiel is in the Weeping Colossus (area W17), along with her pouch of magical seeds.  

Saving the delegates solves the mystery that drew the characters into this adventure.

## Fane of the Eye

Below the ruined halls of Tyar-Besil is a maze of natural caverns and ancient structures that was here before the dwarves built their stronghold. Long ago, drow exiles devoted to the worship of Elemental Evil built this subterranean shrine to the Elder Elemental Eye. This is where the four prophets found their elemental weapons.

The Fane of the Eye serves as common ground for the cults. Here the animosities among air, earth, fire, and water are set aside, and a wary truce prevails. Malevolent and inscrutable, the Eye watches over the cultists and judges them, or so the prophets believe. Were it not for the belief that the Eye wants them to work together, the cults would fight constantly.

Each temple complex in the ruins of Tyar-Besil offers access to the fane. Below the fane are four elemental nodes from which the cults draw their power. Cultists traveling to an elemental node must pass through the fane. Each cult keeps control over access to its elemental node, but any of the temples or elemental nodes can be accessed from the fane.

### Fane Features

The fane consists mostly of caverns, some improved by magical manipulation of the rock. The northeast portion includes chambers built by the dwarves of Besilmer, so it resembles the stonework of their city. The complex has the following features. Any exceptions are noted in areas to which they apply.

#### Ceilings

In the passages, the walls slope together unevenly to meet at an angle about 15 feet above the floor. The chamber ceilings are about 10 feet above the floor near the walls, but they can be as much as 30 feet high in the middle.

#### Dark Curtains

Clouds of black fog, cold and oily to the touch, cordon off areas of the fane. They block vision and mute sound. Objects pass through unimpeded, but living creatures doing so feel psychic resistance and nausea from pushing through. Only creatures devoted to Elemental Evil are untroubled by the sensations.

#### Doors

Doors are made from stone slabs balanced on central pivots. Opening a door creates two openings about 3 feet wide. No original locks remain operable, but the cultists secure some doors with a hasp-and-pin mechanism. A door closed in this way can be forced with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

#### Light

The glow of weird, phosphorescent lichen—a side effect of the strange magical properties of the area—provides dim light. The lichen is more heavily concentrated in the upper reaches of the large chambers, and just barely visible in the passages.

### Areas of the Fane

### F1. Worm's Stair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The skeleton of a giant worm is fused to the sides of this long tunnel, disappearing into a nearly vertical tunnel fifty feet above the floor. Wooden steps have been lashed to the bones, creating a makeshift staircase. Several odd backpacks lie in a pile on the floor at the foot of the stairs.
^46c

The vertical tunnel leads to area A20 of the Temple of Howling Hatred, almost 150 feet above. The stairs end after 50 feet, requiring an easy climb up the ribs.

#### Treasure

The odd backpacks are five [balloon packs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/balloon-pack-pota.md) (see chapter 7) left here by the cultists.

### F2. Howling Pit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Wind howls as it climbs this dark shaft.
^46f

After 80 feet, the pit tapers into a tunnel (area N1 of the Howling Caves, described later in this chapter). Chaotic gusts blow up and down the shaft, too weak to pose an actual hazard. Climbing the rough pit walls requires successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks.

### F3. Wind Prison

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stone pedestal in the middle of this cavern holds a glassy sphere about eight inches in diameter. The sphere seems to contain swirling smoke. Battered armor, damaged weapons, and tattered clothing are strewn around the chamber, but the floor within ten feet of the sphere is free of such debris. Several weapons on the ground seem like they might still be serviceable, although all are badly worn.
^471

If the orb is disturbed, all creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be swept up into a whirlwind, suspended 20 feet in the air. The orb vanishes as the whirlwind forms.

Those suspended in the whirlwind are [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and battered by windblown debris. At the start of each of its turns, a creature [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the whirlwind takes `1d10` bludgeoning damage. A creature in the whirlwind can use its action to attempt a DC 20 Strength check. If successful, the creature ends the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on it, falls 20 feet to the floor, and escapes the whirlwind. A creature outside the whirlwind can attempt a similar check to pull another creature from the whirlwind, assuming it has the ability to reach a target 20 feet in the air. The whirlwind lasts 1 minute and then collapses, releasing creatures caught within it.

While the whirlwind rages, four [flying swords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/flying-sword.md) animate from the debris scattered around the cave. The flying swords attack creatures outside the whirlwind.

### F4. Harpy Nest

Characters spot the light in this chamber before entering it.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A bronze torch glowing with a magical light lies next to the corpse of a bare-chested man with a shield in the shape of a crab shell and a broken shark-toothed sword. Several other corpses are scattered on the floor. Some have been picked down to bone, their clothing and armor discarded nearby, while others have hardly been touched.
> 
> The walls are uneven, with small ledges and fissures on all sides. The ceiling is about a hundred feet high.
^473

Three [harpies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) nest on the highest ledges. These wicked creatures guard the cave for the Cult of the Howling Hatred. The bodies are those whom the harpies lured to destruction. When the harpies spot intruders, they begin to sing.

Those who are affected by the harpies' song are compelled to climb. The nests are 80 feet above the floor. The first 40 feet of the climb require a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks, but after that, the DC is 15.

#### Corpses

The bodies on the floor include a water cultist (the figure with the crab-shell shield and broken sword), two lizardfolk, an ogre, and a male halfling in the robes of a cleric of Sune, and a female half-elf fighter in battered plate armor.

#### Treasure

The harpies have collected loot in their nests, including 560 sp, 220 gp, a gold bracelet (50 gp), a silver ewer (10 gp), a pair of silver earrings shaped like skulls (each worth 10 gp), and a [potion of superior healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md) .

### F5. Rust Monster Pit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A low, thin mist clings to the floor of this cave, and the walls glisten with moisture. Several sets of crude bronze manacles are anchored to the walls, and three hold haggard human captives. The captives are [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious), although they groan and writhe slowly.
> 
> A steady breeze blows toward a passage to the west, while from the east comes the distant sound of running water.
^478

The mist is natural, caused by the humid air in area F6 being drawn westward by the draft in area F3 across cool stone in this cavern. The mist conceals a pit at the north end of the cave.

#### Pit

A character searching the floor notices the pit with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

A character unaware of the pit falls into it. The pit is 10 feet deep and contains a [rust monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/rust-monster.md) that wandered into this cave after being driven out of area F9. The rust monster is heavily obscured by the mist and makes a surprise attack against a creature that falls into the pit, gaining advantage on its attack roll if its target is [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

#### Prisoners

Three captives are chained to the walls. Two are fire cultists, while the third is a riverboat crewman captured a few days ago by Crushing Wave river bandits. The manacles are secured by cotter pins that are easy to remove, but the captives can't reach them. Manacles can also be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

### F6. Swift Stream

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A waterfall gushes out of the wall of this large cave, filling a swirling pool and then coursing through a passage to the north. A winding footpath follows the rushing stream. In addition to the stream's passage, there are stone stairs leading up into a passage of dwarven stonework to the north and cave mouths to the northwest and southwest.
^47d

This cavern is the center of the Crushing Wave cult's presence in the fane. Two [water weirds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) lurk in the pool and guard the area for the cult. They attack anyone approaching the water who fails to give the water cult's hand sign. The pool is 20 feet deep. Swimming in the pool requires DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks due to the swirling currents. Any creature that fails such a check is swept into the stream.

The stream is 4 feet deep, cold, and swift. Any creature without a swimming speed that moves into the stream for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be swept 40 feet downstream. Swimming against the current requires a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### Stairs

The stairs lead up to area C28 in the Temple of the Crushing Wave (chapter 4).

### F7. Blackmaw Throne

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A big stone bench surrounded by dozens of humanoid skulls stands against the northwest wall of this dank cavern. In the middle of the room, hot coals glow in a fire pit, while crude nests of moss and mud are heaped here and there.
^481

A [lizard king](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizard-king.md) named Drexa leads the Blackmaw tribe, a group of lizardfolk devoted to the Crushing Wave cult. A [lizardfolk shaman](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk-shaman.md) named Sskesh advises Drexa, and eight [lizardfolk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) warriors make their nests in this area.

Armed with morningstars, shields, and javelins, the Blackmaws are vile savages that torture, kill, and eat their enemies.

#### Roleplaying Drexa

Although the lizardfolk here are evil and bellicose, Drexa believes he should be one of the leaders of the Crushing Wave. He resents that such a position wasn't given to him. Those who look likely to overthrow [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md), or who have proof they have done so, might be able to convince Drexa to help them. Drexa has seen failed coups before, and he sides with the characters only if he's sure to wind up on top.

#### Narrow Tunnel

The tunnel leading east is 10 feet high and only 2 feet wide. Medium characters must squeeze to move through it.

#### Treasure

Drexa has amassed a small amount of treasure from the Blackmaws' participation in various raids on the surface. He regards the tribe's treasure as his own. Two wooden chests contain 2,300 cp, 1,250 sp, and 290 gp. In addition, Drexa wears a heavy gold chain worth 200 gp.

### F8. The Plunge

The waterfall here can be heard from quite a distance.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The roar of falling water fills this cavern. A stream flows from a passage to the south and spills over the edge of a forty-foot-wide pit. A set of slick stone steps descends into the spray-filled bowl to the north, while a passage to the west holds steps leading upward.
^487

A creature swept over the falls lands in a water-filled basin (area P1 of the Plunging Torrents, described later in this chapter), taking no damage. At the start of its turn in the basin, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be driven 10 feet underwater and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) there. The creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, ending the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on a success.

The stairs that hug the edge of the pit, though slippery, provide a much safer route down to area P1.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/056-poa05-03.webp#center)

### F9. Fungal Swamp

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A forest of weird fungal growth infests this large cavern. Giant toadstools and puffballs stand in and among shallow pools of water or atop ledges along the walls. Those walls are covered by huge growths of shelf fungi. Water drips constantly from above.
^489

The influences of elemental earth and elemental water meet in this cavern, producing a muddy bog crowded with enormous fungi. Most of the fungi are harmless, and some are even edible. However, three [violet fungi](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/violet-fungus.md) cluster where the footpaths intersect.

A [grell](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/grell.md) lurks in the upper reaches of the chamber, watching for lone travelers or stragglers it might be able to pick off. The creature quietly drifts down and attacks the rearmost member of a party that is otherwise occupied.

#### Shelf Path

Because dangerous fungi often lurk near the footpaths, denizens of the fane who pass through this chamber have found another way around. The shelf fungi adhering to the walls are surprisingly sturdy and offer a 3-foot-wide path that circles the eastern side of the chamber. Any character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher spots the shelf path, and exploration reveals it automatically.

### F10. Foebreaker's Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stone sarcophagus rests on a dais in the southern half of this room. A worn frieze circles the monument about four feet above the ground, but it has been badly damaged, and it is difficult to make out what the carvings represent.
^48d

This crypt marks the resting place of a dwarven hero of ancient Tyar-Besil who fought a great battle against monsters invading from the Underdark. Close inspection shows that the wall carvings depict a dwarf slaughtering minotaurs and grimlocks. The name Hendrel Foebreaker is inscribed in the Dethek script on the lid of the sarcophagus, followed by the Dwarvish phrase, "Bow your head, and remember valor."

The crypt contains Hendrel's bones, interred here as a warning to Besilmer's enemies. His tomb is also the center of a [hallow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallow.md) spell, which extends to the doors of the room. Any good-aligned humanoid who heeds the tomb's carving receives the effect of a 5th-level [aid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/aid.md) spell. A creature can benefit from this effect only once per day.

### F11. Foot of the Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cavern is a vertical shaft. Rising up the shaft is a black stone obelisk, twenty feet on a side, with a stone staircase wrapping around its sides, ascending into darkness.
^48f

The stairs ascend to area B17 in the Temple of Black Earth (see chapter 4).

### F12. Abandoned Mine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A natural passage enters this rubble-strewn chamber from the south, petering out to the north. Stone doors lead to the east, west, and south. Rusting iron rails are anchored to the floor, and a pair of ancient ore carts still rest on the rails. The dust on the floor is thick, and the air is stale.
^491

The dwarves of Tyar-Besil began to carve mining tunnels here, but they gave up when faced with too many threats pouring up from the Underdark.

Four [specters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) lurk in the shallow tunnel to the north. These are the spirits of grimlocks that died here long ago and became infused with the evil that permeates the fane. They attack any living creature that enters this chamber. The cultists avoid the area.

#### Treasure

If any character is currently under the blessing of Hendrel Foebreaker (area F10), the shining apparition of a stern dwarf warrior in golden mail appears when the last specter is defeated. With a slight smile of gratitude, the spirit silently points at a heap of rubble at the end of the northern tunnel, then fades away. Beneath the debris lies Hendrel's magic hammer, a [dwarven thrower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dwarven-thrower.md). The weapon can't be found until Hendrel's spirit manifests.

### F13. Hall of Black Crystal

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Weird crystals jut from the walls and the floor of this ancient hall, giving off violet light. On the east side, these crystals form a distinct doorway or gate, beyond which the floor slopes downward. Two huge bedrolls and barrels full of provisions are in the southern end of the room.
^494

The eastern passage descends to area G1 of the Black Geode (described later in this chapter). To protect their sanctum, earth cultists stationed two [hill giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) here. Each giant wears ring mail (AC 14).

#### Roleplaying the Giants

The giants, Karg and Maul, pass the time playing a game akin to Tic-Tac-Toe, using rocks of different colors. Maul is frustrated because he has been losing to Karg. When the party arrives, he calls out, "I wanna play dese li'l guys! Hey, puny-bones! Wanna play?"

If a character accepts the challenge, resolve the outcome of each game with an Intelligence contest. The giants usually bet 10 gp per game. Losing infuriates Maul; if the characters fail to calm him, he attacks, which prompts Karg to attack as well. The giants also attack if no character accepts the challenge or if they characters speak ill of their game.

#### Treasure

Karg and Maul carry large satchels. Between them, they have 160 gp, 22 pp, three red spinels (100 gp each), a fine amethyst (150 gp), and a mummified human head.

### F14. Zegdar's Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cavern is festooned with dozens of burned human hands and reptilian claws fixed to the walls with iron nails. An iron brazier in the middle of the room is full of hot, glowing coals. A large sleeping pallet of furs is arranged to the south. A hulking minotaur sits on the pallet, counting coins in an iron coffer, while a strange one-eyed creature cowers next to the brazier.
^499

The **minotaur **is [Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md), chief of the Emberhorn tribe. He has 117 hit points, wears a chain mail hauberk (AC 16), has an Intelligence score of 11, speaks Undercommon, and is blessed by [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md). The blessing grants the minotaur immunity to fire damage as well as the following additional action option:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Burning Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The minotaur exhales a cloud of burning embers in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
^49a

[Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) has directed Wyx, a simpering [nothic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md), to act as [Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md)'s adviser. Wyx flatters [Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md) so that he does his job and doesn't become a problem. The rest of the Emberhorns hate Wyx, but [Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md) sees the nothic as proof of his importance.

#### Trophies

The Emberhorn minotaurs take trophies by hewing the hands from their smaller defeated foes. To dedicate the victory to [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md), the minotaurs roast the hands in coals.

#### Treasure

[Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md)'s iron coffer contains 130 sp, 220 gp, and ten flawed hematite gemstones worth 5 gp each.

### F15. Fiery Throat

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ten-foot-wide slab of stone levitates in the center of this wide vertical shaft. A bridge-like pier of rock juts out to meet the platform from a wide ledge on the eastern side of the shaft. Hot fumes rise from below, and the shaft glows with fiery light below this level. The shaft continues upward into darkness.
> 
> Three passages lead away from the shaft. A small brass gong and a striking hammer are near the ledge.
^4a0

The floating disk is made to move by uttering the proper command word loudly enough for it to echo. The command words are "ash" to make the platform sink and "ember" to make it rise. It takes 1 minute for it to move from one place to another. The shaft ascends to area E14 in the Temple of Eternal Flame and descends to area W1 in the Weeping Colossus (the fire node, described later in this chapter).

Speaking either command word or striking the gong calls the disk to this level. Any such noise alerts the creatures in areas F14, F16, and F17 that someone is here.

### F16. Emberhorn Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A blackened ogre skeleton stands against the north wall of this cavern, pinned in place by iron nails and rawhide straps. A black iron brazier full of hot coals stands in the middle of the room. Three huge, filthy bedrolls lie near the feet of the ogre skeleton.
^4a2

This room houses three Emberhorn [minotaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md) waiting to receive the "blessing of [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md)" (the ability to breathe clouds of burning embers).

The ogre was a minion of the earth cult killed by the Emberhorns a couple months ago. As is their custom, the minotaurs roasted the body and hung the remains as a trophy.

#### Reinforcements

Any loud noise in here causes the minotaurs in area F17 to investigate. One goes to warn [Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md) in area F14, and the other joins battle as soon as possible.

### F17. Ancient Conjury

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stonework in this chamber is noticeably different from the natural caverns nearby. The room was roughly hewn from the surrounding rock but never dressed or finished. In the middle of the floor is a strange symbol shaped like overlapping circles, cut into the stone with two-inch wide channels.
^4a6

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/057-poa05-04.webp#center)

Two [minotaurs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md) of the Emberhorn tribe stand guard in this chamber, defending the fire cult's foothold in the fane. They have the Burning Breath special action (see area F14), having received the "blessing of [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md)."

Long before dwarves established their stronghold in the caves above the fane, these caverns belonged to drow who were drawn here by the area's elemental energies. This chamber was a conjuring room where drow summoned demons using the circles etched in the floor. Any character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the nature of the circles, and that they are ancient and damaged to the point of uselessness.

#### Reinforcements

Any loud noise in here causes the minotaurs in area F16 to investigate. One goes to warn [Zegdar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegdar-pota.md) in area F14, and the other two join battle as soon as possible.

### F18. Drow Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Flame dances above a pool of murky water to the south, lighting the room. A sarcophagus carved from glassy black stone stands atop a natural pedestal toward the north. The sarcophagus has fluted embellishments, delicate ribs, and friezes that show groveling demons.
^4aa

In the center of the sarcophagus lid is a symbol that combines those of the four elemental cults—the symbol of the Elder Elemental Eye (see chapter 1). The cultists believe the coffin is holy and left it undisturbed. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check can identify the sarcophagus as an example of drow artistry. The sarcophagus contains only dust and bones.

#### Trap

A [glyph of warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) protects the sarcophagus. A character can find the glyph with a successful DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Triggered by any attempt to open the coffin, the glyph casts [Mordenkainen's sword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mordenkainens-sword.md) (melee spell attack +10). The sword attacks any creature within 30 feet of the sarcophagus, starting with the triggering creature. It disappears after 1 minute.

#### Flaming Water

The flame burning on the water is fed by natural oil seeping into a tainted pool that is 5 feet deep. The water is undrinkable.

### F19. That Which Lurks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the middle of the chamber is a statue depicting an amorphous body and thick tentacles, hunching over as if to feed. A purple crystal the size of a human head represents one alien eye.
^4af

Drow carved this chamber and raised this idol to honor Ghaunadaur, a dark god associated with oozes. A character must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check to identify this obscure deity.

The "crystal" is worthless glass. Any creature that removes or destroys the stone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be subjected to Ghaunadaur's curse. The curse is like a [polymorph](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph.md) spell, except it turns the offender into an [ochre jelly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) that lacks the Split reaction. A [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell ends this effect.

### F20. Hall of Battle

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room smells of blood and death. The debris of several recent battles is scattered throughout this rough-hewn chamber. A dozen dead warriors, clearly of the earth and water cults, lie amid a handful of monstrous corpses, such as those of bugbears and ogres. Some of the bodies look like they have been here for months, while others are only days old. A whirlwind of air encased in armor and clutching a flail rushes into view.
^4b1

This chamber has been a battleground for the elemental cults as they seek to consolidate control of the fane. The Cult of the Howling Hatred presently holds the room, which is guarded by an [air elemental myrmidon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md) (see chapter 7).

When intruders appear, the myrmidon levels its flail at them and asks in a cold voice, "Whom do you serve?" The myrmidon decides whether the adventurers are friends or foes, based on their response to its question and the gear they wear. If the characters look like air cultists and reply that they serve elemental air or the Elder Elemental Eye, the myrmidon might be satisfied. If not, the myrmidon attacks.

#### Treasure

The various human corpses in this hall include air cultists, earth cultists, and a pair of fire cultists. No coinage or other valuables remain, but the characters can scrounge up cloaks, surcoats, or robes sufficient to create five air cultist disguises, four earth cultist disguises, and one fire cultistdisguise.

### F21. Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stone ziggurat capped by a huge altar of black granite stands in the middle of this cavern. At the foot of the altar lies a bound and gagged figure. Fresh rivulets of blood stain the altar and trickle down the steps of the ziggurat. On all sides of the cavern, guttering flames dance atop sluggish pools of oily water. Gusts of wind moan and howl from fissures high in the cavern walls.
^4b4

This chamber is the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye, the dark force that lies behind Elemental Evil. The ziggurat dates back to ancient times when drow renegades venerated the Eye, long before the days of Besilmer. The elemental prophets come here to seek visions and boons from the Eye, although it is a fickle and uncommunicative power that rarely responds in any recognizable way.

#### Altar

Any non-evil creature that touches the altar or makes a melee weapon attack against it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) psychic damage. The altar has AC 15, 150 hit points, and immunity to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, psychic, and thunder damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. As long as the altar remains intact, servants of Elemental Evil (including members of the hour elemental cults) can't be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) while in this room.

#### Flaming Water

The flames burning on the pools are fed by oil seeps beneath the water. The water is tainted and undrinkable.

#### Cult Forces

One of the four elemental prophets is here when the adventurers first arrive. Accompanying the prophet is a handful of subordinates. Choose from the following options, discounting any prophet who has been defeated:

- [Aerisi Kalinoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/aerisi-kalinoth-pota.md). The air prophet is accompanied by [Windharrow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/windharrow-pota.md) (if he escaped the Temple of Howling Hatred), two [hurricanes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hurricane-pota.md), and three [Howling Hatred initiates](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/howling-hatred-initiate-pota.md).  
- [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md). He is mounted on a [giant crocodile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md) and accompanied by four [Crushing Wave reavers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/crushing-wave-reaver-pota.md).  
- [Marlos Urnrayle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/marlos-urnrayle-pota.md). The earth prophet is accompanied by two [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) and two [Sacred Stone monks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sacred-stone-monk-pota.md) wearing gargoyle masks.  
- [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md). The fire prophet has a [flameskull](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) and two [razerblasts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/razerblast-pota.md) under her command.  

The prophet knows who the characters are. He or she is also aware of any other prophets the party has faced and defeated, having seen the events in fevered visions. The prophet dismisses any such defeat as the culling the weak, assuring the characters that no such weakness is to be found here.

If it seems in keeping with the prophet's personality (see chapter 7), he or she attempts to recruit the characters, saying, "You have shown you are resourceful and have great courage. We can use you. Swear allegiance to me, and I shall show you power such as you have never dreamed of."

##### Sacrifice

If the characters accept the prophet's offer, he or she demands a test of good faith. The prophet and entourage move to a tactically safe position. Then, to prove their sincerity, the new converts must offer the sacrifice. The villains have a [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) named Darreth, abducted from Womford weeks ago, as a sacrifice. Darreth is already bound, gagged, and lying at the foot of the altar.

Darreth doesn't know the layout of the fane, but he has met each prophet except the one the characters defeated on the temple level. He can describe their appearance and demeanor, and he can identify the elemental weapons that each one carries. Further, he knows that these weapons are important and somehow connected to places of elemental power called "nodes."

If he is set free, Darreth is brave enough to accompany the characters if they so wish, and also desperate enough to make the trip back to Womford alone if the characters give him directions back to the surface.

#### Treasure

Each elemental prophet carries an elemental weapon (see chapter 7).

### Conclusion

Defeating the prophet in the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye (area F21) causes the two remaining elemental prophets to receive a vision of the defeated prophet's final moments and the final incantations of a summoning ritual they haven't yet attempted. Each surviving prophet retreats into his or her respective elemental node and begins preparations to summon one of the four Prince of Elemental Evil.

Any monsters in the fane remain until the characters defeat them.

## The Howling Caves

These caves belonged to deep gnomes who had started to explore the Besilmer ruins when the air cult arrived. When the air cult seized the caves below Tyar-Besil, the svirfneblin organized resistance. Their attempt was futile. As soon as [Aerisi Kalinoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/aerisi-kalinoth-pota.md) understood the power of the [devastation orbs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/devastation-orb-pota.md), she tested one on the svirfneblin. The resulting cyclone obliterated the outpost, and its chaotic after effects imbued the caves with elemental power which blows through the caves to this day.

### Cave Features

The area has the following features. Any exceptions are noted in areas to which they apply.

#### Ceilings

Most cavern ceilings are 30 feet high, and passage ceilings range from 10 to 15 feet high.

#### Light

The Howling Caves are lightless.

#### Wind

Wind continuously moves through the Howling Caves, in whispers or howls.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.2: Howling Caves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/058-05-02.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/059-poa6.webp#gallery)

### Areas of the Caves

### N1. Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A subterranean wind blows north, up the tunnel, carrying distant screams from the south.
^4c4

The north end of the tunnel forms the bottom of a widening shaft that leads up to area F2 in the Fane of the Eye. The rough walls can be climbed safely.

### N2. Deadly Pool

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The temperature plunges in this cave, which is dominated by a frozen pool. Ice crystals glitter on the walls, floor, and other rock formations. Snow whirls about on strong gusts.
^4c6

When the characters first arrive, the temperature in this cave is −30 degrees Fahrenheit. The ice is frozen solid and slippery. (See chapter 5, ""Adventure Environments"," in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for rules on extreme cold and slippery ice.) For every minute the characters spend here, there is a cumulative ten percent chance that the temperature shifts dramatically.

When the temperature shifts, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Suddenly, the air grows very warm. Water rains from above. The ice cracks, and thick waves of steam rise from the pool. Bobbing among the breaking ice, the bloated bodies of small humanoids stare up with wide, dead eyes.
^4c7

The shift to extreme heat, as described in "chapter 5" of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, takes only a moment. When the heat begins, the ice cracks at the start of that round and is unable to hold any weight end of the round 3 rounds later. The lake is 12 feet deep and turns to boiling water. A creature that enters the water for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage. In addition, steam renders the cave lightly obscured.

#### Floating Corpses

The bodies are the boiled remains of svirfneblin that lived in area N5.

### N3. Oubliette

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Gore spatters the floor and walls of this windy cave, and the floor is strewn with dismembered humanoid corpses. A windy cyclone moves among the remains. A shaft in the ceiling leads up farther than you can see.
^4cb

The shaft leads to area A18 in the Temple of Howling Hatred. An [air elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) is bound to this area and cycles beneath the shaft like a red cyclone. Everywhere it moves, it spatters the walls with blood, bone, and viscera.

The corpses are sacrifices to [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md), hurled down the shaft by air cultists. The symbol of elemental air is cut into each victim's forehead. The characters can find an intact head and see the symbol in gory relief.

### N4. Storm Chasm

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A chasm divides the subterranean passageway, which continues on the other side ten feet away. Fog obscures the chasm's depths.
^4cd

The chasm is 50 feet deep, and the lower 40 feet of it is heavily obscured by fog. At the bottom of the chasm are blunt rocks and cave floor. The walls are rough and can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

The chasm fills with wind, thunder, or lightning at random times. If one or more creatures are in the chasm, have them roll initiative. On initiative count 10, roll a `d20` and consult the following table to determine what effect, if any, occurs in the chasm:

`dice: [](05-chapter-5-temple-of-the-elder-elemental-eye.md#^effect)`

| dice: d20 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1–10 | None |
| 11–15 | Wind |
| 16–18 | Thunder |
| 19–20 | Lightning |
^effect

#### Wind

A strong wind fills the chasm for 1 minute. The wind extinguishes open flames in or above the chasm and imposes disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks made by creatures in the chasm.

#### Thunder

Thunder momentarily fills the chasm. Each creature in the chasm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 10 (`3d6`) thunder damage and is [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened) for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened).

#### Lightning

Lightning momentarily fills the chasm. Each creature in the chasm must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (`8d6`) lightning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

### N5. Svirfneblin Settlement

If the nycaloth is in area N7, the characters hear a horrid, rasping song coming from the eastern passage.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Dwellings carved in the walls of this cavern have been torn asunder by some intense force. Ruins of several dwellings resemble gaps in the walls and piles of rubble. Scores of small humanoid corpses are scattered among the ruins.
^4d3

This svirfneblin settlement was the test site for [Aerisi Kalinoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/aerisi-kalinoth-pota.md)'s first [devastation orb](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/devastation-orb-pota.md). Four [specters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) of deep gnomes who perished here wander the ruins. The power of the air node imbued them with elemental energy, so their attacks deal lightning damage instead of necrotic. They attack any creature that enters the cavern.

### N6. Breathless Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Giant spiders are seized in death among dead cave lizards, giant bats, a carrion crawler, and a female drow decked in fine chain mail, with ruby-pommeled knives at her hips. No injuries are apparent, and the smell of death is fainter than one would expect. At the back of the cave, within ten feet of the drow, a breeze whistles through three tiny fissures in the rock.
^4d5

The fissures magically pull the air from the cave and the lungs of any creature that comes within 30 feet of the back of the cave. Such a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to breathe. The creature can't breathe normally again unless it succeeds on the saving throw, made again at the end of each minute. A [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell also ends the effect, as does [bottled breath](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bottled-breath-pota.md) (see chapter 7).

#### Treasure

The drow wears a suit of [elven chain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/elven-chain.md) and carries a pair of fine daggers decorated with rubies (1,000 gp each), as well as a scroll of [primordial ward](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/primordial-ward-xge.md) (see appendix B). See area N7 for more information on this drow.

### N7. The Floating Ones

If the nycaloth is alive here, the characters hear a horrid, rasping song coming from the area before they see it.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two humans, an aarakocra, and a drow hang suspended from hooks connected to chains. Blood pools on the floor beneath them. Beetles scurry along the floor, walls, and down the chains and onto the victims, which faintly struggle, rasp, and moan as a breeze turns them around and around. Debris, including tattered clothing and broken weapons, is scattered against the walls.
^4d8

This gruesome display is the work of a [nycaloth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nycaloth.md) that takes sadistic delight in torturing captives. It guards the outer reaches of the Howling Caves against intruders.

#### Prisoners

The prisoners here are in poor condition. Each one is incoherent and has 1 hit point remaining. Healing brings a captive back to his or her senses.

The humans are two [Howling Hatred initiates](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/howling-hatred-initiate-pota.md) (see chapter 7) who angered Aerisi one time too many. They're sullen and silent if interrogated. They flee for the surface at the first opportunity.

Feathergale knights captured the [aarakocra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/aarakocra.md), named Kazra and brought her here for interrogation. She wants only to fly under the open sky once again and pleads with the characters to escort her back to the surface.

The [drow mage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow-mage.md), Balix, is a historian and companion to the dead scout in area N5. They came to see the Fane of the Eye and to find out if surfacers were here, and they walked into a cult ambush. He wants nothing to do with the cults, the surface world, or anything other than returning to the nearest drow community. He uses his innate [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md) spell to retreat as soon as possible.

#### Treasure

Among the debris is a spider silk pouch with 23 pp and a [necklace of prayer beads](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/necklace-of-prayer-beads.md). The necklace holds one *bead of blessing*, one *bead of curing*, one *bead of summons*, and one *bead of wind walking*.

### N8. Wind Chorus

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Wind rushes through this curving natural passage and off into the darkness beyond, howling in a changing pitch as it feeds through the alcoves and fissures of faraway caves.
^4dd

Occasionally, while here, one or more characters hear whispered lies or hateful howls, as many times as you wish.

#### Whispered Lies

Choose an NPC friend or ally who was or is important to the affected characters. Those characters hear the NPC's voice on the wind, but the voice taunts and whispers of failures, flaws, and negative traits.

#### Hateful Howls

Choose an NPC adversary who was or is important to the affected characters. The voice of the adversary swears vengeance, makes threats, and foretells doom.

### N9. Mushroom Forest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cave has an uneven floor covered with toadstools. The toadstool caps are spotted white, purple, green, and blue. Some are as low and wide as forest ferns while others stand as tall as humans, their stems thick as the trunks of trees. Still others shed a faint light, eerily illuminating a sloped passage leading down to the shore of a placid body of water that also glows dimly. Beneath whispering gusts of air, the sound of dripping water echoes.
^4e2

Among the myriad fungi, several are magical and act as potions if eaten. One aqua-spotted toadstool acts as a [potion of longevity](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-longevity.md). Two amber toadstools flecked with gray work as [potions of heroism](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-heroism.md). Three pale lavender toadstools are like [potions of healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md). These magical toadstools regrow over the course of the next year.

Eating any other toadstool forces the eater to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw after `2d4` minutes. Failure indicates the consumer is [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). A creature [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, ending the effect on a success.

The sloping passage to the south leads to area N12.

### N10. Stalagmite Garden

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Wind blows through this weird stalagmite garden. The rock formations are smooth and contorted, their natural forms weathered to be chaotic and abstract.
^4e4

Supernatural air has weathered the stalagmites such that they form weird images as one moves through the cavern. The characters might see a line of figures struggling to walk against the wind, faces of the dead, or anything else you wish to depict or convey in your campaign.

### N11. Hero's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A yellow casket rests on the flat top of a stone column in the middle of a glowing mere.
^4e6

The natural column rises 20 feet and is slick with water and fungus, so it requires successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to climb unaided. The casket is covered with a patch of yellow mold (see chapter 5, "[Adventure Environments](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/yellow-mold.md)," in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

Beneath the mold, a Dwarvish inscription on the casket reads, "Here rests Godwyd the Wyrmbane, dragonslayer and peacekeeper." The casket contains dust, bones, a cloven skull and helm, and a battered breastplate. A gleaming shortsword is clutched in the skeleton's hands (see "Treasure" below).

#### Treasure

Godwyd's shortsword is a [dragon slayer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dragon-slayer.md). Removing the blade causes a low moan to rise from the casket, but nothing else happens.

### N12. Glowing Mere

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Surrounded by tall stalagmites and fungi, a wide, placid pool of water stretches through this elongated cavern. The water glows a soft blue, and in its shallows, silvery fish dart in and out of sight.
^4e9

The mere is 15 feet deep at its deepest point. The water here is clear and clean.

### N13a–N13b. Whispering Caverns

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cave has an uneven floor. Wind whispers through the flowstone formations here.
^4eb

These caves are empty.

### N14. Air Node's Doorstep

Wind blowing from area N15 intensifies as it passes through this area, extinguishing torches and other open flames.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several windy tunnels meet at a chasm. Ledges along the cavern walls create natural footpaths above the abyss.
^4ed

The chasm is 100 feet deep. The strong wind makes walking on the narrow ledges treacherous. Any creature doing so must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. A creature that fails this check falls from the ledge into the chasm. Normally, the chasm would be easy to climb, but the wind makes it so the climb requires successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks. A creature that fails such a check falls from the chasm wall.

### N15. Windhuggers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A warm wind swirls through this smooth cave, seemingly changing course at random. Nine cultists wearing feathered cloaks stand here with arms outstretched, as though waiting for the wind's embrace or, perhaps, waiting for the wind to carry them somewhere far, far away.
^4ef

A [Howling Hatred priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/howling-hatred-priest-pota.md) and eight [Howling Hatred initiates](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/howling-hatred-initiate-pota.md) (see chapter 7 for both) are here, but they are too swept up in their "windhugging" to fret about intruders. They attack only if the characters disturb them. This wind here is loud enough that sounds of combat in this cave can't be heard elsewhere.

### N16. Tortured Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls have a smoothed, rippled look about them, as if the stone was melted. Squat stalagmites and elongated stalactites bend and lean in unnatural arcs. A strong draft blows across the rock formations, eliciting a hollow howl.
^4f1

As the characters explore this area, a [black pudding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md) pours out of a narrow crack in the wall behind them, cutting off their escape. It fights until slain.

### N17. Sacrifices

Characters hear the wind and spot the green light here before arriving.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At an intersection of four tunnels, a mighty gale blows from the northern way, making a constant howl. Two braziers burn with green flame, lighting the area. Numerous rock columns join the floor to the ceiling. Severed silk ropes, darkly sodden with blood, sit at the base of three gore-spattered columns. Tied to two other columns are two women, each with a symbol cut into her forehead.
^4f3

Prisoners are kept here until they can be sacrificed to [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) in area N19. Two [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [barlguras](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) guard the prisoners. The demons lurk among the columns in the upper reaches of the cave, dropping down to attack intruders who dare free the prisoners. If they spot the characters, the two women warn characters of the "[invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) demons" that guard them.

#### Light

Two braziers light this area with [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells.

#### Prisoners

Two humans are kept here, the symbol of air cut into each one's forehead. One is Nerise Gladham, a farmer (an unarmed [commoner](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) with 2 hit points remaining). The other is Deseyna Norvael, a high-ranking Waterdhavian diplomat (an unarmed [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) with 4 hit points remaining) who was part of the Mirabar delegation. Both prisoners want only to escape this area and return to civilization.

### N18. Royal Guard

The wind is so strong in this chamber and the tunnel leading to area N19 that each creature starting its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet toward area N17. Flying creatures have disadvantage on the save. From this point on, a creature must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to area N19. Flying creatures spend 5 feet of movement instead of 2.

The wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a fifty percent chance to extinguish them.

The characters spot the green light ([continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md)) from the brazier here before arriving.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A powerful wind roars through this small cave, causing bits of debris to ricochet off the walls, exploding into dust from the impact. In the middle of the cavern a stone brazier is lit with a steady green flame. Blocking the tunnel to the north are four thin figures in billowing cult robes. The wind doesn't seem to impede them at all.
^4f8

Four emaciated [Howling Hatred priests](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/howling-hatred-priest-pota.md) (see chapter 7)—Aerisi's most devout cultists—guard this area. Periods of sustaining themselves upon only air have warped their bodies. Their eyes bulge from cavernous sockets, and skin stretches across jutting bone. Because of their devotion, they are immune to the wind's effects.

### N19. Air Portal

Characters hear thunder and see flashes of light as they approach this area.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the middle of this cavern, spikes of stone jut upward like three immense claws. Between them, a churning thundercloud thrashes with lightning. Thunder cracks, and cascades of tiny rocks tumble from above. Beneath the thunderhead stands a raised area splattered with the blood of many sacrifices.
> 
> A silvery window is sometimes visible in the center of the cloud. It opens onto clouds in an endless sky.
^4fa

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/060-poa05-06.webp#center)

If the characters defeated Aerisi, two [air elemental myrmidons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md) (see chapter 7) defend this cave.

If Aerisi is here but isn't the only prophet still alive, use the "Encounter with Aerisi" section. Use the "Encounter with [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md)" section if Aerisi is the only remaining prophet. In either encounter, the air elemental myrmidons aren't present.

#### Encounter with Aerisi

[Aerisi Kalinoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/aerisi-kalinoth-pota.md) (see chapter 7) stands next to the air portal, protected by an [air elemental myrmidon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md). While attempting to call [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) into the world, she tries to stay out of the characters' reach while casting her destructive spells. The myrmidons focus on thwarting and killing ranged attackers and spellcasters.

Aerisi refuses to flee at this point, and trying to do so through the air portal with [Windvane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/windvane-pota.md) would be disastrous. When the characters defeat her, she vanishes in a scream of wind, but [Windvane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/windvane-pota.md) remains, as does the portal.

#### Encounter with Yan-C-Bin

When the characters arrive, [Aerisi Kalinoth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/aerisi-kalinoth-pota.md) is alone. She holds [Windvane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/windvane-pota.md) aloft and cries, "With this key, I call forth my lord and master!" The moon elf then bows as [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) (see chapter 7) flies through the portal. The Prince of Evil Air appears as a gaunt, dark-gray man with white hair and glowing eyes. In this form [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) smiles, and his eyes flash with lightning. As Aerisi gloats, [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) focuses on destroying the characters.

#### The Air Portal

The thundercloud surrounds a silvery window, which is a portal to the Plane of Air that leads directly to the steps of [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md)'s [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) castle. This portal is 30 feet from the floor.

Those who pass through the portal arrive on the steps of [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md)'s [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) fortress, where [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) comes forth to destroy them. Although [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) can enter the world only when the proper ritual is complete, the characters can easily flee through the portal.

Characters can close the portal only by hurling [Windvane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/windvane-pota.md) into it, destroying the weapon in the process. If the portal closes while [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) remains in the world, he is forced back to the Elemental Plane of Air.

#### Treasure

Aerisi has decked herself in royal finery. She wears a platinum torc (worth 1,600 gp), gold and sapphire rings (four, each worth 1,000 gp), and a diadem (6,400 gp) from Evereska. She carries [Windvane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/windvane-pota.md) (see chapter 7).

## The Plunging Torrents

Dangerous waterfalls, sudden deluges, and weird elemental effects fill the Plunging Torrents, a cavernous extension of the Elemental Plane of Water.

### Torrents Features

The complex has the following features. Any exceptions are noted in areas to which they apply.

#### Ceilings

Cavern ceilings are 10 feet above the water.

#### Climbing

The walls are rough, slippery stone that require successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to climb.

#### Currents

In locations near steep waterfalls, rapid currents exist. Whenever a creature enters a strong current for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be carried 10 feet in the direction of the current, as indicated by arrows on the Plunging Torrents map. The creature can attempt to swim against the current by making successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks. Such water is difficult terrain for all swimmers.

#### Doors

Interior doors are made of stone and have neither locks nor keyholes.

#### Light

The node is dimly illuminated by blue and green glows that radiate from the water.

#### Water Depth

Most water is 20 feet deep.

#### Waterfalls

Waterfalls are 40 feet high. A creature swept over a waterfall takes no damage from the fall. However, at the start of its turn in the lower basin, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be driven 10 feet underwater and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) there. The creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, ending the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on a success.

#### Aboleth Whispers

Whenever the characters explore a new area, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1, choose one character to receive an image of the setting features (but not creatures) in area P4, P5, or P6. The aboleth living in the node is telepathically projecting these images to frighten trespassers and ultimately lure them to its lair.

Whenever a character responds to this telepathic contact, a link is established. The aboleth instantly knows all the character's desires and goals. It then intermittently projects images to the character in which everything the character loves is destroyed by the Cult of the Crushing Wave. After receiving these images, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a random form of short-term madness, as described in chapter 8, "Running the Game," of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

#### Random Encounters

Check for a random encounter every 10 minutes. Roll a `d20` and consult the following table to determine what, if anything, the characters encounter:

`dice: [](05-chapter-5-temple-of-the-elder-elemental-eye.md#^encounter)`

| dice: d20 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 [giant octopus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus.md) (see area P11) |
| 2–3 | `1d4` [ice mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/ice-mephit.md) (see area P14) |
| 4 | 1 [water weird](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) (see area P16) |
| 5 | 1 [Dark Tide knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/dark-tide-knight-pota.md) mounted on a [water weird](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) (see area P16) |
| 6 | `1d4` [swarms of quippers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md) |
| 7–20 | None |
^encounter

#### Symbol of Water

Within the Plunging Torrents, any creature that has the symbol of water scratched into their flesh gains a swimming speed equal to its ground speed, is immune to the effects of currents, and suffers no negative effects from descending a waterfall. Inscribing the mark deals 1 slashing damage and leaves a scar. Healing magic can remove the scar and the capabilities it grants.

### Areas of the Torrents

### P1. Waterfall Basin

The waterfall here can be heard from quite a distance.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A loud waterfall pours into this mossy cavern. Wet stairs hug the western wall, climbing higher than the waterfall and descending into the water-filled basin. Where the stairs meet the water's surface, an iron post juts at an angle, and a flat boat is tied to it. Tunnels to the northeast and northwest channel the water from the pool. Above the pool, a seven-foot-diameter globe of water hovers in midair.
^50e

A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 10 or higher notices the water symbol engraved above the northeast passageway.

The stairs descend 5 feet beneath the lake surface, ending at a rough underwater ledge 15 feet above the submerged cavern floor. The stairs ascend to area F8 in the Fane of the Eye.

#### Iron Post

The iron post is a recent addition to the cavern, planted haphazardly into the rock of the staircase. When the characters arrive in the chamber for the first time, a punt is moored here.

The punt is a long, flat-bottomed boat equipped with a pole for navigation through the water node. This punt can accommodate up to seven Medium creatures. As part of its movement, a creature can use the pole to propel the punt 10 feet. The punt has AC 8 and 50 hit points. If it goes over a waterfall, it loses 25 hit points and capsizes.

#### Watery Globe

The 7-foot globe of water floats 1 foot above water level and is stationary until a creature touches it, whereupon it envelops the creature and carries it to area P20 via the northeast tunnel (passing though areas P12, P14, and P16). The globe has a flying speed of 10 feet, and a creature contained within gains the benefit of a [water breathing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-breathing.md) spell for as long as it remains in the globe. Any time during the trip, the creature inside the globe can swim out of it as an action. The globe carries only the one creature and bursts upon reaching its destination. A globe is immune to damage, though [dust of dryness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dust-of-dryness.md) destroys it.

When the globe is destroyed or leaves this cave, another one rises up out of the water to take its place.

### P2. Plunging Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The current moves swiftly toward a small, rocky island that splits the waterway north and south. The sound of falling water is louder to the south.
^513

The current pulls to the south of the island toward the waterfall leading to area P17. Characters navigating the area by water are pulled south and over the falls unless they take countermeasures.

The waterway to the north flows westward down the passageway, unaffected by the current.

### P3. Nets

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The waterway dead-ends in a long cavern where only the distant sound of the falls echoes off the walls. Nets divide the cavern, spanning the distance between pairs of stalagmites jutting above the water.
^515

Seven [giant crabs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-crab.md) dwell in this cavern. Three are in plain sight on the rocky ledge to the northwest. Two crabs cling underwater to each span of net. Characters observing the water must roll a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to spot the submerged crabs, which climb their nets to attack any creatures that pass within reach. Once combat starts, all the crabs attack.

#### Nets

Each net draped across the cavern has AC 8 and 20 hit points. They extend 5 feet above the water. Because the nets are wet, each has resistance to fire damage. Once a net drops to 0 hit points, the net sinks into the water and provides no impediment.

#### Underwater Passage

If the characters explore beneath the water, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Forty feet beneath the water, the walls are constructed of worked stone. Red and black mosaics of tentacles flank a set of black marble doors in the south wall. Reliefs of long, curving fangs line the arc of the door frame.
^519

The double doors push open to reveal an underwater passage to area P4.

### P4. Temple Entrance

The walls of this cavern are covered with slime and can't be climbed without gear, and the water here is fouled and unfit to drink.

The water fills the cavern to within 2 feet of the ceiling. The following boxed text assumes that the characters can see underwater:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Through the water looms a colonnade supporting an arched pediment above a long portico. Behind the colonnade is a pair of stone doors graven with a relief of a circular, saw-toothed maw. In the plaza in front of this structure, four slimy, fishlike humanoids kneel beneath a sunken stone idol of branching tentacles, which convene at the top around a circular fanged mouth.
^51b

At the southwestern end of the plaza, a set of curving stairs climbs above the water.

Four [kuo-toa](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa.md) worship at the altar, while a [kuo-toa monitor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa-monitor.md) guards the northeast doors. The kuo-toa try to capture victims for their aboleth god (see area P6).

#### Reinforcements

If a battle occurs here, the creatures from area P7 investigate and join the fray.

### P5. Shrine of Yngukulub

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room echoes with the roar of falling water. Relief carvings of horrific mouths, each framed by a knotwork of oozing tentacles wrought in stone, adorn the slime-covered walls of this half-submerged shrine.
^51f

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stairs lined with columns ascend from the water to a landing where a block of smooth stone serves as an altar. Chains snake from the base of the altar, ending in open, rusty manacles.
^520

Three fish-like humanoids with jagged teeth stand around the altar. One wears a headdress of kelp and seashells, and it holds aloft a trident with tines shaped like tentacles.

This is where the aboleth in area P6 comes to feed on sacrifices. A [kuo-toa archpriest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa-archpriest.md) armed with a [trident of fish command](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/trident-of-fish-command.md) and two [kuo-toa](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa.md) attend their god here. They attempt to capture the characters and chain them to the altar. The rough-hewn landing on which the altar sits is 20 feet above water level.

Replace the kuo-toa archpriest's Scepter action with the following action:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Trident of Fish Command.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, or 6 (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
^521

The walls of this cavern are covered with slime and can't be climbed without gear, and the water here is foul and unfit to drink.

#### Reinforcements

If the aboleth is in area P6, it crawls up to the landing and joins the battle.

### P6. Yngukulub the Devourer

An [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) named Yngukulub the Devourer has allied itself with [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) and the Cult of the Crushing Wave. Deranged kuo-toa bring the aboleth sacrifices, and when they lack a proper sacrifice, they willingly feed themselves to their hungry god.

Yngukulub obeys [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) because it awaits the day when [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) drowns the civilized world and crushes the temples of the gods. In the dark age that results from the triumph of [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md), aboleths can return to their proper place as rulers of the world.

If [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) was defeated in the Temple of the Crushing Wave, the aboleth guards the water portal in area P20. Otherwise, it is here.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The slimy water that fills this cave flows through a hole in the east wall before plunging into the cavernous darkness beyond. Tall, slime-covered columns ascend from the foul water. Each one is decorated with a mosaic depicting elves, dwarves, humans, and other races descending into the fanged maw of a three-eyed, tentacled horror at the base of the column. The monster's eyes glitter like gems.
^526

If it is here, the aboleth reaches out telepathically to the characters, promising to fulfill their desires in exchange for servitude. Characters who refuse are pulled down into the briny depths and devoured. The aboleth is heavily obscured by the dark, slimy water while completely submerged. It has no trouble pursuing prey that plunges over the waterfall to the east.

#### Reinforcements

The kuo-toa in area P5 come to the aboleth's defense if they aren't already dead.

#### Treasure

The triple eyes of the aboleths depicted on the columns are actually emeralds, sapphires, and blue-green opals. The six gemstones are worth 1,000 gp apiece.

Lying on the floor of the aboleth's cave are 180 pp, 1,700 ep, and a [tentacle rod](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tentacle-rod.md).

### P7. Quipper Pit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stairs rise to a small, damp cave where five loathsome fishfolk stand around a pit, choking and muttering.
^52b

The pit is 10 feet wide and 40 feet down to the water. The water at the bottom of the pit is 10 feet deep (enough to cushion a fall).

Four [kuo-toa](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa.md) and a [kuo-toa whip](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa-whip.md) have filled the pit with a [swarm of quippers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md). They ritually feed creatures to the quippers at times when they and the aboleth are sated. Their ritual is nonsense: gasping, muttering, and croaking with no basis in any known language. The kuo-toa attempt to push characters to the pit.

### P8. Sloping Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stalactites cover the ceiling of this cave, which slopes down toward the south. Embankments skirt the edges, and small, flat stones rise from the water, which is about 5 feet deep. Tiny white fish move through the shallows, darting over glittering coins visible beneath the water.
^52d

A [roper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md) and four [piercers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/piercer.md) cling to the cavern ceiling among the stalactites. A character who pays close attention to the stalactites and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots the symbol of water etched into the creatures' tough flesh.

The roper attacks first. As it snares prey with its tendrils, it pulls its prey under the nearby piercers, which then drop from the ceiling. The piercers have advantage on attack rolls made against creatures [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the roper.

#### Treasure

Beneath the water are 230 ep and 563 gp.

### P9. Crushing Wave Outpost

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ceiling of this large, water-filled cavern is 30 feet above the water's surface. In the middle of the cavern, two rocky plateaus rise twenty feet above the water. Atop each plinth crouches a humanoid with slimy, translucent skin. The water flows toward the southeast, where you hear a thunderous waterfall.
^530

The water is only 5 feet deep in this cavern. The walls of the plateaus are wet but rough, and can be climbed with successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks.

Two [Crushing Wave reavers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/crushing-wave-reaver-pota.md) (see chapter 7) keep watch atop the plateaus. Each has five javelins. They are slaves of the aboleth, and slime covers their translucent flesh. They aren't afraid to die.

Unless they are drawn to area P20 to protect the aboleth, two [chuuls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) lurk behind the plateaus. They step out of hiding and attack interlopers as soon as the Crushing Wave reavers start hurling javelins. If a chuul paralyzes a foe, it allows the current to take the helpless creature over the falls and into area P20.

### P10. Trial by Water

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ribbon of dry land hugs the walls of this cavern, the walls of which are covered with chalk-scrawled symbols of elemental water.
> 
> In the center of the cavern, a wrought-iron cage dangles from a rope lashed to a stalactite. Three-fourths of the cage hangs submerged in the pool that fills the middle of the cavern. A dozen humanoids pack the cage, elemental water's symbol raised in a scar on every brow. Tired hands grasp at the bars as the captives struggle to press their mouths above the water. Among the mass of wrestling forms, some lay still, floating face down inside the cage.
^532

Eight [Crushing Wave reavers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/crushing-wave-reaver-pota.md) (see chapter 7) occupy the cage with the drowned corpses of four other cultists.

[Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) locked weak and disobedient cultists inside the cage in a ritual meant to strengthen them. The cultists attack if the characters free them, using bare hands until they can seize weapons. They surrender if reduced to half their number.

### P11. Hunter's Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Water drips from the stalactites in this serene cave, echoing through the gloom. Wide rock ledges extend around the perimeter, and natural stone islands provide ample room to sit or lay down.
^534

This cave is the lair of a [giant octopus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus.md). It spends most of its time hunting, so it has only a ten percent chance each hour to be in its lair.

Submerged tunnels connect this cave to areas P12 and P18. Characters swimming underwater spot them automatically.

#### Secret Passage

A one-way secret door blocks access to a submerged tunnel that ends at another similar door. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check is sufficient to find either door, but they open only from the other side.

### P12. Feeding Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long pool fills the cavern, broken only by an island bristling with stalagmites. A corpse floats face down in the water near the island.
^538

[Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) uses this cave to dispose of those who oppose or displease him.

#### Underwater Gate

A submerged tunnel leads to area P13. This tunnel is blocked by a sturdy and locked iron gate. Four short iron chains ending in manacles are anchored to the iron bars of the gate. Using thieves' tools, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The gate can also be wrenched open with a successful DC 25 Strength check.

#### Drum

A drum stands amid the stalagmites on the island. The cult uses the drum to alert the ghouls in area P13 when fresh meat awaits them.

#### Floating Corpse

The corpse belongs to a Crushing Wave initiate who got too close to the underwater gate while inspecting its manacles and was [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) and clawed to death by the ghast in area P13. A search of the corpse reveals a ring with two keys—one that unlocks the gate, and another that unlocks the gate's manacles.

#### Southern Area

While exploring the southern part of this area, characters can hear the cackling of the mephits in area P14 above the roar of the falls. The temperature begins to drop the closer one moves toward area P14.

### P13. The Hungry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Humanoid bones are scattered across the water's bottom. Barnacles cling to the cave walls, and piles of splintered bone crowd the cave's ledges and islands. The smell of brine battles with the stench of decay.
^53f

Seven [ghouls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) and a [ghast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghast.md) gnaw on the bones in this cave. When a creature enters their lair, the ghouls dive in to devour it and escape confinement.

### P14. Eye of Anguish

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Frosty mist fills this cave. Icicles and water crystals glitter along ledges, the ceiling, and the walls, and a brittle crust of ice surrounds a central isle upon which crouches a pale-skinned, bare-chested man wearing an eyepatch. He is surrounded by seven cackling, prancing, imp-like creatures made of ice. Five humans are spread-eagled against the far wall, frozen to its surface, their skin black from frostbite. Some hang upside down or sideways; some are missing fingers, hands, and feet.
^541

A [one-eyed shiver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/one-eyed-shiver-pota.md) (see chapter 7) and seven [ice mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/ice-mephit.md) inhabit this cave. The one-eyed shiver, called the Eye of Anguish by the other cultists, oversees the torture of prisoners. The ice mephits assist him.

#### Frozen Prisoners

The humans stuck on the cave wall are surfacers who learned too much about the Cult of the Crushing Wave or who stood in its way. A few could be adventurers who failed to stop the cult. Decide who these prisoners are, if any of them are alive, and what role you want them to play.

#### Development

If the battle here is extremely loud, the cultists in area P16 know to prepare for danger.

### P15. Reflection Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A throne made of coral and seashells stands on the rock at the center of this chamber. Across the arms of the throne, a pearl- and sapphire-encrusted narwhal horn rests like a lordly scepter. The smooth surface of the cavern's pool reflects the throne.
^546

[Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) uses this chamber as his personal retreat, where he reflects on the future of his cult.

The water here radiates divination magic under the scrutiny of a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. Once per day, when a creature touches the narwhal horn to the pool, a [scrying](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) spell is instantaneously cast. The spell is limited to creatures and locations within the Plunging Torrents, allows no saving throw, and turns the pool's surface into a scrying sensor. If the horn's wielder doesn't specify a target before touching the horn to the pool, roll a `d20`. The roll is the number of the area shown in the pool for the spell's duration. (For example, a roll of 9 focuses the scrying sensor on area P9.)

A submerged passage leads to area P14. Characters swimming underwater spot it automatically.

#### Secret Passageway

An underwater, one-way secret door swivels to allow access to a submerged tunnel leading northwest. Finding the door requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. A similar secret door at the end of the tunnel opens into area P11 and can be spotted without an ability check.

#### Treasure

Encrusted with sapphires and pearls, the narwhal horn is worth 10,000 gp. A creature holding the narwhal horn in this cave feels it tug toward the reflective water.

### P16. Hut of the Dark Tide

The waterfall at the southern end of this cave is audible from the northern approach.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A crude stone hut perches atop a stony island in the midst of a wide pool. Water drizzles from the cavern ceiling, and the roar of a waterfall echoes throughout.
^54b

Two [water weirds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) hidden beneath the water's surface serve as bonded mounts for two [Dark Tide knights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/dark-tide-knight-pota.md) (see chapter 7) who live in the hut on the island. One knight is standing guard on the island when the characters first arrive; the other one is resting inside the hut.

The hut contains two hammocks made from fishing nets, as well as the knights' weapons, clothing, and belongings. None of these belongings are valuable.

### P17. Elemental Guardian

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Water pours into this cavern from a waterfall to the north, then flows over a second waterfall to the south. Thick mist conceals the cavern ceiling, with only an occasional stalactite piercing the fog. The surface of the water undulates in big, rolling waves.
^54d

The ceiling is 30 feet above the eater's surface. A [water elemental myrmidon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md) (see chapter 7) lurks under the water but rises to attack trespassers not dressed as water cultists.

### P18. Wrecks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Heavy rain batters what must be a gigantic cavern, its walls and ceiling lost in the driving storm. Even the roar of the waterfalls to the north, west, and south hush beneath the rain's noise as it strikes the water.
^54f

At the center of the cavern, the shattered hulks of sailing vessels lean upon their sides. Barnacles cling to the hulls. Humanoid skeletons droop from the rigging or lay in tangled piles, and seaweed hangs from the gunwales.

The rain renders the entire area lightly obscured, and strong currents on either side of the wreckage pull toward areas P19a and P19b. Despite the enormity of the cavern, the water here is only 5 feet deep.

A [hydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md) nests among the wrecks, and it attacks any intruder that isn't [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md).

#### Wrecked Ships

[Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) channeled the power of the water node to deliver these vessels to [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) as a demonstration of her power. One of the wrecks is the Tethyrian merchant galley that once conscripted a young [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) into brutal indenture. The other is the same Calishite pirate vessel that attacked the Tethyrian merchant galley, an event that caused Gar to be cast adrift and lose his arm to a shark.

The wrecks form solid ground, but in most places they are difficult terrain, slick with rain where they aren't full of holes and splintered wood. Any character who attempts a complex maneuver, or takes the Dash or [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action, must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or fall from the wreckage.

The ships lean on their sides. At your option, the ships might have multiple levels of vertical terrain, hanging sails, and tilting masts, which the characters can climb or use as walkways.

#### Treasure

The Calishite pirate ship carries a chest laden with treasure. Characters searching the wreck find the chest, which contains a [+1 scimitar](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md), an [alchemy jug](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemy-jug.md), 1,200 gp, a diamond worth 5,000 gp, and two small rubies worth 1,000 gp each.

The hold of the Tethyrian merchant vessel is gutted, its supplies long gone. One of the skeletons aboard wears a suit of fine scale mail decorated with shell motifs. This scale mail is [mariner's armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/mariners-armor.md).

### P19a–P19b. Vortexes

Strong currents channel water from area P18 to these caves. In the center of each cave is a swirling vortex. Any creature drawn down into the vortex is teleported to a random body of water within the Plunging Torrents. Roll a `d20`; the number rolled determines of the location where the creature appears. For example, on a roll of 7, the creature teleports to the quipper pit in area P7.

### P20. Water Portal

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An island rises from a lake at the epicenter of three roaring waterfalls. Flutes of rose, ivory, and lavender coral fringe the island. Above the island floats a gigantic, shimmering globe of water. Smaller globes of water emerge from it, drift outward, and hover in the air a few feet above the surface of the lake. The ambient light reveals the cavern ceiling, eighty feet above the island and hung with countless stalactites.
^555

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/063-poa05-08.webp#center)

The cave floor gradually rises toward the island, such that the water is 20 feet deep at the cave perimeter and only 5 feet deep within 10 feet of the island.

If the characters previously defeated [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md), use the "Encounter with the Aboleth" section. If Gar has retreated to the node and the characters have defeated two other elemental prophets, use the "Encounter with [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md)" section. If Gar is the sole remaining prophet, use the "Encounter with [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md)" section.

#### Water Globes

When the characters first arrive, three 7-foot-diameter globes of water drift about this cavern. Each globe of water floats 1 foot above water level and is stationary until a creature touches it, whereupon it envelops the creature and carries it to area P1 via the north tunnel (passing though areas P18, P17, and P2). The globe has a flying speed of 10 feet, and a creature contained within gains the benefit of a [water breathing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-breathing.md) spell for as long as it remains in the globe. Any time during the trip, the creature inside the globe can swim out of it as an action. The globe carries only the one creature and bursts upon reaching its destination. A globe is immune to damage, though [dust of dryness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dust-of-dryness.md) destroys it.

If a globe is destroyed or leaves this cave, another one emerges from the water portal to take its place.

#### Encounter with the Aboleth

The [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) from area P6 and the two [chuuls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) from area P9 guard the portal. The creatures are submerged in the southwest corner of the cave when the characters first arrive. The aboleth hopes to kill or enslave the characters, seize [Drown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/drown-pota.md), and replace [Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) as [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md)'s prophet.

#### Encounter with Gar Shatterkeel

[Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) (see chapter 7) stands on the island before the water portal, beginning his ritual to call forth [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md). He is guarded by a [water elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) and three [crocodiles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/crocodile.md) that circle the island, attacking any creatures that approach.

Gar makes a final stand here. He can't retreat to the Plane of Water with [Drown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/drown-pota.md), and he refuses to abandon his grim mission. When the characters defeat him, he turns to inky water and courses away. [Drown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/drown-pota.md) remains where he fell.

#### Encounter with Olhydra

[Gar Shatterkeel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gar-shatterkeel-pota.md) stands on the island, unguarded. He holds his trident aloft and cries, "With this key I call forth my mistress!" A dark flow emerges from the portal, forming an immense water elemental with pearly, malignant eyes. This is [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md), Princess of Evil Water (see chapter 7). [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) focuses on remaining in the world to work evil, especially keeping [Drown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/drown-pota.md) away from the characters.

##### Rising Water

When [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) appears, the water in the lake rises 2 feet at the end of each round. Since the waterfalls in the cavern are 40 feet high, the lake rises to the level of areas P9, P16, and P18 after 20 rounds. Once the water reaches the tops of the waterfalls, the water stops at 60 feet deep.

#### The Water Portal

The water portal is a 13-foot-diameter globe of water that floats above the island.

Characters who pass through the portal arrive underwater on the Elemental Plane of Water, where [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) comes forth to destroy them. Characters can retreat through the portal; however, [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) can't pass through the portal until the ritual is complete.

Characters can close the portal only by hurling [Drown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/drown-pota.md) into it, destroying [Drown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/drown-pota.md) in the process. If the portal closes while [Olhydra](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) remains in the world, she is forced back to the Plane of Water. No more watery globes form within the Plunging Torrents, and the water in the node returns to normal levels. Over the course of the next few days, much of the remaining water siphons out into the surrounding earth.

## The Black Geode

The Black Geode is a natural cavern distinguished by the seams of luminous violet crystal. [Marlos Urnrayle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/marlos-urnrayle-pota.md) used [Ironfang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ironfang-pota.md) to transform these caverns into an earth node. In the Black Geode's largest cavern lies a portal that leads to [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)'s domain on the Elemental Plane of Earth. Bizarre creatures from that place have crossed through the gate and now inhabit the caverns, while the raw energy of the elemental plane seeps out and is slowly transforming the Black Geode into a reflection of [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)'s domain.

### Geode Features

The area has the following features. Any exceptions are noted in areas to which they apply.

#### Character Recognition

Even if he has not yet encountered the characters, Marlos has seen them in his visions. The earth prophet gives descriptions of the characters to all cultists in the Black Geode.

#### Ceilings

Cavern ceilings are 30 feet high, while tunnels are 15 feet high.

#### Light

Most areas are dimly lit by crystal formations that give off a soft, violet glow.

#### Random Encounters

Check for random encounters once every 30 minutes. Roll a `d20` and consult the following table to determine what, if anything, the characters encounter:

`dice: [](05-chapter-5-temple-of-the-elder-elemental-eye.md#^encounter)`

| dice: d20 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 [burrowshark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/burrowshark-pota.md) riding a [bulette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) (see area G13) |
| 2 | 1 [stonemelder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/stonemelder-pota.md) and `1d3 + 1` [Black Earth guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/black-earth-guard-pota.md) (see area G12) |
| 3 | `1d2` [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) |
| 4 | 1 [umber hulk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/umber-hulk.md) (bursts out of a nearby wall) |
| 5 | Bleeding earth |
| 6 | Ceiling collapse |
| 7 | Crystal extrusion |
| 8 | Fissure |
| 9 | Flowstone growth |
| 10–20 | None |
^encounter

##### Bleeding Earth

A nearby wall swells and splits open, oozing thick black mud.

##### Ceiling Collapse

A tremor causes part of the ceiling to collapse above one random party member. If the party includes NPCs, be sure to count them as well. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and buried. While buried in this way, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to extricate itself or another buried creature, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

##### Crystal Extrusion

A crack splits open on a nearby wall, extruding foot-long, luminous violet crystals.

##### Fissure

A tremor causes a fissure `1d6 × 10` feet deep to open in the floor beneath one party member (determined randomly). If the party includes NPCs, be sure to count them as well. The affected party member must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure, taking bludgeoning damage as normal unless it is tied off or otherwise protected against falling. The walls of the fissure are rough and can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

##### Flowstone Growth

Stalactites within 30 feet of the party begin to drip like melting wax. By the time the change ceases, each stalactite has grown `1d4` feet longer. If a stalactite touches the opposite surface, it becomes a natural column.

### Areas of the Geode

### G1. Hall of the Guardians

This cave lies at the end of a twisting, declining tunnel that began in area F13 of the Fane of the Eye.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rough walls of this cavern rise to a vaulted ceiling hung with stalactites and clumps of slender, luminous crystals that bathe the cavern in a soft, violet light. Passages lead east and west. To the east, the tunnel ascends. The western passage is flanked by a pair of twenty-foot tall stone statues of rough-hewn humanoids, their faces grim masks of forbiddance. Next to each statue is a human guard encased in stone armor.
^56b

Two [Black Earth guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/black-earth-guard-pota.md) (see chapter 7) stand in front of the statues. Characters not wearing disguises are recognized for who they really are. Characters disguised as earth cultists or cult prisoners must make a Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check contested by the guards' Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks; if all the characters succeed, the guards are fooled and allow them to pass.

If combat erupts here, two [earth elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) burst up from the middle of the floor and join the battle. These elementals have veins of glowing purple crystal; each sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for another 15 feet beyond that.

### G2. Keltar and Gorx

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this circular chamber are thick with glowing crystals. In the middle of the room is a fat, egg-shaped creature with three arms, three legs, heavy-lidded eyes, and a wide mouth atop its stony ovoid body. Casually dropping gemstones into the creature's gaping mouth is a creepy-looking earth cultist.
^56d

A [stonemelder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/stonemelder-pota.md) (see chapter 7) named Keltar keeps vigil with a [xorn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/xorn.md) he discovered hiding in area G17. If the characters attack either, both retaliate in kind. The xorn flees once it has fewer than 20 hit points, but Keltar fights to the death.

#### Roleplaying Keltar

Keltar believes the xorn, called Gorx, is an emissary from [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) sent to test the cult's worth. In fact, the creature wandered through the earth portal out of curiosity. Since Keltar was eager to please Gorx, it has done nothing to dissuade him.

The xorn has convinced Keltar that [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) wants tribute, and so Keltar extracts offerings from everyone who passes through. Keltar is so obsessed with offerings that he ignores the appearance of passersby and the usual pass phrase. When he notices the characters, he asks, "Do you bring an offering?"

Making an offering involves throwing precious metals or gems into the xorn's maw. Keltar soberly informs contributors the treasure is transported to [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)'s domain.

The xorn can smell the party's wealth, and so it demands a tribute of 500 gp in Terran. If the party complies, Keltar asks, "Is our prince satisfied with the offering?" to which Gorx replies, "The prince finds this sacrifice pleasing." Keltar believes the xorn has deemed the party worthy, so he allows them to pass. He also helpfully responds to inquiries. If the characters are undisguised, he directs them toward area G3, as another test of their worthiness. Keltar directs the characters toward area G6 if he believes them to be cultists and also reminds them of the pass phrase to cross the stone bridge (area G9) safely: "We walk in the shadow of [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)!"

If the characters refuse to pay, the xorn attacks the character carrying the most treasure. Meanwhile, Keltar flees to area G6.

#### Treasure

The xorn's stomach still contains some undigested offerings: 9 gp, three egg-sized chunks of rough moonstone worth 25 gp each, three carnelians worth 50 gp each, and a cracked amethyst worth 100 gp. Keltar carries two more carnelians and hides a folded scroll of [investiture of stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/investiture-of-stone-xge.md) (see appendix B) in a pocket.

### G3. Roper Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cave is a thicket of stalagmites and stalactites. Several weapons and broken pieces of armor lie scattered among the spires in the room's center.
^572

A [roper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md) hangs from the ceiling above the debris. It ate several cultists before the others started avoiding the area. Eager for more humanoid flesh, the roper attempts to subdue as many of the adventurers as it can. It closes its eye and retracts it tendrils when reduced to 20 hit points, hoping the characters leave it alone.

#### Treasure

Scattered amid the broken weapons and armor are 65 gp, a brass statuette of an imp with onyx eyes worth 180 gp, and a [ring of swimming](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-swimming.md).

### G4. Bewildering Crystals

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cave is a forest of glowing crystals, which grow like foliage on slender stone columns that make it difficult to gauge the chamber's true size. Slumped against one of the columns is a dead man wearing a stone breastplate.
^575

Any creature entering the cave for the first time on a turn or starting its turn inside must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of a [confusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell. Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

A thunderous noise emanates from the northeast tunnel, which is only 5 feet high and slopes gently upward to area G6. The tunnel ends at a wall of falling mud (see area G6). Any creature passing under the mud takes 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage.

#### Corpse

The corpse belongs to a Black Earth guard killed by one of his fellow cultists. The guard carries nothing of value.

#### Secret Passage

The "secret" entrance to area G5 is a tunnel cloaked by a 6th-level [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md) spell to look like a solid stone wall. Discovering its nature from a distance requires a DC 19 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, although direct interaction immediately reveals the illusion.

### G5. Underdark Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A hole in the back of this cave forms the mouth of a tunnel that plunges deeper into the earth. The tunnel is devoid of the luminous crystals that grow elsewhere in these caverns, and a chill, fetid breeze wafts up from its depths.
^57a

This tunnel runs for miles, eventually branching off into the caves of the Underdark.

### G6. Mudflow Falls

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The dull roar of splashing, churning mud fills this cavern, the walls and ceiling of which are streaked with glittering veins of glowing violet crystal. A stream of mud pours through a gash in the roof, cascades down until it crashes onto a ten-foot-high ledge, then tumbles over the ledge into a thin river of mud that flows out through a hole in the northeast corner. A stone staircase climbs up to the ledge, where a passage leads north. A tunnel on the lower level leads south.
^57c

Earth cultists call this river of elemental mud the Mudflow. The river is 6 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and descends a total of 40 feet by the time it reaches area G11. Any creature that enters the river for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must make a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and be swept 20 feet toward area G11. A creature that is [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) in the mud must use an action and succeed on a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to stand up. Standing isn't possible within the section of tunnel between this cave and area G11; that stretch of the river is completely submerged in mud.

A creature can use an action to pull itself or another creature within its reach out of the Mudflow, doing so on a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

Every 1 foot of movement through the mud costs 2 feet of speed, 5 feet if the creature is trying to move against the flow.

#### Hidden Tunnel

A 5-foot-high tunnel hidden behind the mud descends to area G4. A creature must pass through the mud to reach the tunnel, taking 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage from the falling mud.

#### Ledge

The western portion of the cave is 10 feet higher than the eastern portion, and the ledge can be scaled with a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The stone staircase leading up to the ledge is on the north side of the Mudflow.

### G7. Empty Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small cave is striated with glowing violet crystals. A tunnel to the south turns sharply eastward, while a tunnel to the north slopes down and toward the east as well.
^581

This area is perfect for random encounters.

### G8. Cavern of the Lost Crown

As the party approaches this area for the first time, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Bloodcurdling screams come from the cave ahead. The cries last only a few seconds, then stop suddenly.
^583

Once the party can see the cave, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Humanoid bones litter the floor of this cavern. Some skeletons are partially intact, their rib cages shattered by boulders lying atop them. Only one skeleton remains whole, and it clutches to its chest an open-faced steel helmet decorated with a golden circlet above the brow, from which seven small gold spikes project upward.
^584

The crowned helmet is an ancient dwarven relic (see "Treasure" below) that radiates strong magic when scrutinized with a [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. As soon as someone tries to take it, the [ghost](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of a duergar treasure hunter named Reulek appears and uses his Horrifying Visage, screaming, "Thieves! Learn from my folly! Even in death, the dwarves of Besilmer guard their fabled treasure!" As the ghost intones these words, four [specters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter.md) of dead drow killed here long ago in a cave collapse materialize and attack the living.

#### Roleplaying Reulek

Earth cultists found the crowned helmet in the Temple of Black Earth but failed to realize its significance. Reulek later stole it and was sneaking toward area G5 when he fell prey to the specters in this cave.

Reulek believes the specters killed him for stealing the helmet. His soul is bound to the relic by the thought that he must return it to its rightful owner before going to his eternal rest.

If the adventurers defeat the specters and talk to the ghost, Ruelek explains his predicament. If the characters point out the specters weren't dwarves and probably didn't care about the crown, Reulek admits that his death may have had nothing to do with the relic. He knows that the remains of the last king of Besilmer are beneath the Halls of the Hunting Axe. He asks the characters to help him return the crowned helm to the king's tomb. Characters who agree find that Reulek accompanies them through his connection to the relic, although he manifests only when you wish him to do so.

If the party refuses to help, or if at any point Reulek gets the sense that they aren't going to follow through on their promise, he uses Possession to enforce the agreement. If the party stays true to the bargain, Reulek's spirit thanks them as he goes to his rest.

Reulek was the partner of an oni named Obratu (see "Vale of Dancing Waters" in chapter 6). The characters might recognize his name from the note they find if they defeat Obratu. Reulek shrugs if the characters mention Obratu, saying, "It was a partnership of convenience."

#### Treasure

The golden-spiked helm is the [Lost Crown of Besilmer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/lost-crown-of-besilmer-pota.md) (see chapter 7).

### G9. Narrow Stone Bridge

The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive here via the tunnel to the north or south:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage opens onto a smooth stone bridge flanked by boulders. The bridge is five feet wide, has no railings, and spans a wide cavern that echoes with strange clacking noises.
^589

The bridge is 40 feet long and sturdy. A creature on the bridge that takes 10 damage or more from a single source must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature is knocked off the bridge and falls. On any other failed result, the creature is knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) but manages not to fall off the bridge. The bridge is 40 feet above the floor of the surrounding cavern (area G10).

Two [galeb duhrs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr.md) guard the bridge—one at each end. They look like ordinary boulders until they open their eyes and move. To cross the bridge without rousing the galeb duhrs, someone among the passersby must speak the cult's pass phrase: "We walk in the shadow of [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)!" Otherwise, the galeb duhrs wait until intruders are halfway across the bridge before attacking, first by animating the boulders set near them and commanding them to roll across the bridge.

The clacking noises are made by the hook horrors in the surrounding cavern.

#### Reinforcements

Combat on the bridge attracts the hook horrors in area G10, which gather under the bridge and attack any creature that falls.

### G10. Clickety Clack

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This long cavern cuts a wide swath through the earth. Its jagged walls look as if the stone here tore itself apart. Shattered bones lie amid the scree. High above, a narrow stone bridge spans the defile. The chasm echoes with clacking noises that sound a little like falling rocks.
^58d

The cavern ceiling is 80 feet high, and the bridge (area G9) is 40 feet above the cavern floor.

Eight [hook horrors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hook-horror.md) hide in crevices along the walls, communicating with one another using a series of indecipherable clicks and clacks. The hook horrors attack any creature that tries to cross their territory or falls from the bridge.

#### Secret Way

Hidden at the back of one hook horror's crevice is a narrow passage leading 20 feet up to area G7. The opening to this tunnel requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to spot, although a character who explores the crevice by entering it finds the hidden tunnel without an ability check.

#### Treasure

Characters who search through the shattered bones of the hook horrors' previous victims find 17 sp, four pieces of blue quartz (10 gp each), a silver hand mirror inlaid with lapis lazuli (270 gp), and a *pearl of power*.

### G11. Elemental Mud Pool

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A river of thick mud gushes from a fissure in one wall, running a short way before gathering into a swirling pool. Standing next to the pool is an earth elemental encased in armor and several small creatures composed of thick, dripping mud.
^592

The river of mud flows into this cavern from area G6.

An [earth elemental myrmidon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md) (see chapter 7) stands guard, ignoring the taunts of six [mud mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/mud-mephit.md). The myrmidon is protective of the pool and attacks intruders. The mephits join in, but unlike the myrmidon, each one reduced to fewer than 10 hit points flees.

See area G6 for rules about moving through the river of mud. A creature that ends its turn in the swirling pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be sucked down into the Elemental Plane of Earth and lost. A creature tethered by a rope can be pulled 10 feet toward the edge of the pool with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### Development

If the characters observe the cave unnoticed for a few minutes, they see the myrmidon lean over the pool and pluck a fledgling [mud mephit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/mud-mephit.md) from the muck. The pool has a noncumulative five percent chance of spawning a new mud mephit each hour.

### G12. Hall of Meditation

If the characters approach this area quietly and without bright light sources, they can surprise the earth cultists within.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this cavern are broken at regular intervals by small alcoves, each of which holds a shard of glowing violet crystal. Four earth cultists are here. Each one kneels or sits in front of an alcove, in a way that suggests a form of meditation.
^595

At any given time, the cave contains two [Black Earth guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/black-earth-guard-pota.md), one [burrowshark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/burrowshark-pota.md), and one [stonemelder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/stonemelder-pota.md) (see chapter 7 for these cultists' statistics). The guards are in the southern part of the cave, the others in the northern section. If [Hellenrae](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/hellenrae-pota.md) (see chapter 7) has not been defeated, she is here in place of the stonemelder. The cultists are meditating, using the crystals as foci. They are too entranced to hear sounds of combat in areas G9 or G13.

Several barrels and crates stand at the north end of the cavern. They contain water and rations.

### G13. Bulette Kennels

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Boulders have been used to build crude, roofless enclosures similar to pens—three to the north and three to the south. Odd saddles and harnesses are piled in the middle of the cave, while spears and goads lean against the walls.
^597

There is a fifty percent chance that a [burrowshark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/burrowshark-pota.md) (see chapter 7) named Rorgrin is here, along with his trained [bulette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) mount; otherwise they're in area G14. If they are here, Rorgrin and his mount are in plain view and attack intruders on sight.

The enclosures to the north and south are kennels enclosed by 10-foot-high walls. The south kennels are empty. The northern kennels contain three young bulettes (use [rhinoceros](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/rhinoceros.md) statistics, but they bite instead of gore). These bulettes are sleeping if Rorgrin isn't present. A character can sneak past the sleeping bulettes by succeeding on a DC 11 Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. The bulettes awaken on a failed check or if one or more of them is attacked. If Rorgrin is in area G14, the roused bulettes hiss at strangers, alerting Rorgrin to their presence.

### G14. Rorgrin's Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The back of this small cave is filled by a nest made of broken shards of rock. Nearby, a bedroll is laid out on the ground with an odd saddle sitting in place of a pillow.
^599

If the party didn't encounter Rorgrin in area G13, they find the [burrowshark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/burrowshark-pota.md) here with his trained [bulette](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) mount. Half the time, the pair is asleep.

#### Treasure

Stashed under his leather saddle "pillow," Rorgrin keeps a small leather bag containing 91 gp, two garnets (worth 100 gp each), and a [potion of thunder resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-thunder-resistance.md).

### G15. Arcane Foundry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stone slabs line the walls of this cave. Weapons, pieces of armor, and various tools cover the slabs. In the middle of the chamber, steam rises from a well of boiling mud.
^59c

The slabs are worktables covered with tools used for chiseling and carving stone and crystal, as well as weapons and bits of armor (see "Treasure" below).

Two [stonemelders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/stonemelder-pota.md) (see chapter 7) work here, along with a dwarf master smith [Rhundorth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rhundorth-pota.md)—one of the delegates from Mirabar (see below). If [Miraj Vizann](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/miraj-vizann-pota.md) (see chapter 7) survives, he is here in place of one stonemelder. Three [nothics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md) watch from the shadows, ready to provide arcane insight during the forging process. The nothics are unwilling servants and flee toward area G16 if given the opportunity.

[Rhundorth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rhundorth-pota.md) has the statistics of a [guard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) but is unarmed and unarmored (AC 11). His Strength is 18, and he speaks Common and Dwarvish. If given a choice of weapons, he prefers a warhammer (+6 to hit, `1d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage, or `1d10 + 4` bludgeoning damage while using two hands). He is lawful good.

#### Roleplaying Rhundorth

[Rhundorth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rhundorth-pota.md) was conscripted to toil here, helping the earth cult craft armor and weapons in exchange for a promise that other delegates in the earth cult's custody wouldn't be harmed. He knows the sage Bruldenthar was left in the mines of the Sacred Stone Monastery, and Lady Deseyna was captured by air cult raiders. He also reports that the moon elf Teresiel was handed over to the fire cult a couple of tendays ago.

#### Mud Pool

A creature that enters the well of boiling mud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage. The mud is 5 feet deep and heated by a volcanic vent beneath the cave.

#### Treasure

Characters searching the worktables find several crystal staffs, stone morningstars, and pieces of rock armor, as well as a [+1 breastplate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-armor.md) crafted from polished crystal. It bears the symbol of earth, and it heightens its wearer's urges to act in a selfish, greedy, or wicked way.

### G16. Cathedral of Stone

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cavern has a vaulted ceiling supported by six natural stone columns. Crystal growths protruding from the ceiling cast a lurid purple glow over everything. Issuing from a tunnel that descends toward the east is the loud, constant sound of stone grinding against stone.
^5a2

If the nothics in area G15 retreat to this cave, they cower at the western end of the room.

### G17. Earth Portal

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This colossal cavern is an alien landscape filled with soaring stone buttresses, weirdly twisting columns, and gargantuan shards of glowing crystal. A long path of steps is cut into the uneven floor and wends its way between the mighty stone pillars to the cavern's core. There, the steps climb to the base of a stone monolith that is constantly changing its shape, filling the great cavern with a thunderous grinding noise.
^5a4

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/066-poa05-10.webp#center)

If [Marlos Urnrayle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/marlos-urnrayle-pota.md) has been defeated elsewhere, this cavern is guarded by two [earth elemental myrmidons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md) (see chapter 7) that stand before the monolith in plain view. If Marlos has retreated to this cavern and the characters have defeated two other prophets, use the "Encounter with Marlos Urnrayle" section. Use the "Encounter with Ogrémoch" section if Marlos is the last remaining prophet.

#### Encounter with Marlos Urnrayle

[Marlos Urnrayle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/marlos-urnrayle-pota.md) (see chapter 7) stands before the earth portal, attempting to summon [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md). The characters find him with his back turned and the hood of his rich cloak pulled up, so he looks like a finely dressed cult priest. Two [Black Earth guards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/black-earth-guard-pota.md) (see chapter 7) attend him, and four [gargoyles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) cling to the four nearest columns. Marlos continues incantations until he becomes aware of the characters. Then, he pulls back his hood and attacks.

Marlos taunts the characters, challenging those who avert their eyes to behold his power and beauty. The medusa is infuriated if anyone manages to meet his gaze and survive, concentrating his attacks on such characters.

The prophet stands his ground here. He can't flee through the earth portal with [Ironfang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ironfang-pota.md), and his pride doesn't allow him to relinquish his power in the node. When the characters defeat him, he turns to mud and melts away. [Ironfang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ironfang-pota.md) and the portal remain.

#### Encounter with Ogrémoch

[Marlos Urnrayle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/marlos-urnrayle-pota.md) appears much as he does in the previous section. When the characters arrive, he holds [Ironfang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ironfang-pota.md) aloft and intones, "With this key, I call forth the Mountain of Doom, the great and terrible [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)!" He steps back as the earth portal liquifies and the colossal form of [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) emerges (see chapter 7). [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) focuses on destroying the characters with little concern for the consequences to Marlos. The elemental prince's aim is to remain in the world and consolidate power here before sowing chaos.

#### The Earth Portal

The monolith is a portal leading to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Part of the monolith is in a liquid state at any given time, and any creature that touches the liquid stone is pulled into the Plane of Earth, near [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)'s dwelling place. The Prince of Evil Earth can attack intruders on his home plane but can't pursue them through the portal into the world until the proper ritual is complete.

Characters can close the portal only by striking the monolith with [Ironfang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ironfang-pota.md). When the elemental weapon strikes the monolith, it chips the otherwise indestructible stone, causing the portal to implode in a grinding display, showering the area with pulverized rock and crystal. [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) is forced back to his home plane when this event happens, serving the cult. Cultists other than Marlos cower and flee. After the portal is destroyed, [Ironfang](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ironfang-pota.md) turns to rust and disintegrates.

When the portal implodes, an [earthquake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md) spell is triggered, centered at the point where the monolith once stood. Five minutes later, this entire cavern collapses, killing and burying any creatures still inside. The bridge at area G9 collapses as well, while other areas of the Black Geode remain intact. Cut off from the influence of the Plane of Earth, the Black Geode no longer experiences tremors and weird magical effects, reverting to its natural state over a few days.

## The Weeping Colossus

The Weeping Colossus sits in the heart of a volcanic fissure. During the height of the dwarven civilization of Besilmer, lava filled this entire area, and the heat and magma rose into the lowest levels of the city where the foundries were located. When [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) arrived with her cult, she used her connection with [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md), the Prince of Evil Fire, to settle the magma and form the chambers left behind. Now, the fissure and lava tubes serve as the fire node, an extension of the Elemental Plane of Fire, resulting in lava flows, ash storms, gouts of liquid fire, and other strange elemental effects.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.5: The Weeping Colossus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/067-05-05.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/067-05-05-2.webp#gallery)

### Colossus Features

The complex has the following features. Any exceptions are noted in areas to which they apply.

#### Ceilings

Ceilings are 15 feet high in tunnels and 20 feet high in chambers.

#### Chambers and Passages

The various open spaces were formed from flows of lava that crusted over and cooled, with the hotter middle draining away. Where the walls and ceilings are solid, the surfaces are smooth like glass or folded where the liquid stone flowed in layers. In other places, drips and splashes have formed formations like stalagmites, stalactites, and rounded bubble formations similar to bunches of grapes. Despite the solidity of the formations, much of it is still hot.

#### Floors

Floors can be smooth and rounded or flat. In some places, the floor is a crust with lava beneath.

#### Lava

A creature takes `6d10` fire damage when it enters lava for the first time on a turn or when it ends its turn there.

#### Light

All areas of the node are brightly lit by fire or lava.

#### Sounds

The hiss and rumble of flowing lava can be heard throughout the node.

#### Elemental Heat

The map indicates three zones of heat intensity. The low intensity zone is uncomfortably hot but doesn't otherwise impede the characters. Characters in the medium and high zones are subject to extreme heat, as described in chapter 5, ""Adventure Environments"," of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. In the high intensity zone, the DC for avoiding [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) starts at 10.

#### Random Encounters

For every 30 minutes the characters spend inside the Weeping Colossus, roll a `d20` and consult the following table. Explanations of some of the encounters appear after the table. In the medium intensity zone, roll a `d20` and a `d4`, subtracting the `d4` from the `d20` roll. Use a `d6` instead of a `d4` in the high intensity zone.

`dice: [](05-chapter-5-temple-of-the-elder-elemental-eye.md#^encounter)`

| dice: d20 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–2 | 1 [fire elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) |
| 3 | `1d8` [magmin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magmin.md) |
| 4 | `1d3` [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) (see area W7) |
| 5 | Crust break |
| 6 | Flame gout |
| 7 | Lava rain |
| 8 | Smoke cloud |
| 9 | Sulfur cloud |
| 10–20 | None |
^encounter

##### Crust Break

A random character steps on a particularly thin spot on the floor. The character must succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall into a hole (seventy-five percent chance) or lava beneath the thin spot (twenty-five percent chance). If the case of a hole, the character falls `1d4 × 10` feet into an empty magma pocket. The lava deals damage as described earlier.

##### Flame Gout

A bubble of gas spontaneously ignites, creating a burst of flame identical to a [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) spell. The cone starts in the space of a random character and shoots in a random direction.

##### Lava Rain

At the start of a round, lava droplets form on the ceiling and fall in a 20-foot-diameter area, dealing 9 (`2d8`) fire damage to any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. The drops ignite exposed flammable objects. The rain ends at the end of a round `2d4` rounds later.

##### Smoke Cloud

A cloud of smoke kicks up, filling an area 40 feet in diameter and causing that area to become lightly obscured. The smoke dissipates in `1d4` minutes unless a wind disperses it.

##### Sulfur Cloud

A discharge of noxious fumes erupts from a nearby vent. The effects are identical to a [stinking cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stinking-cloud.md) spell.

### Areas of the Colossus

### W1. Volcanic Shaft

This shaft descends from area E14 in the Temple of Eternal Flame, past area F15 in the Fane of the Eye. A magical disk allows easy movement among the levels.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The natural walls of the shaft widen near the base. Heat and light radiate from a bubbling lake of lava that covers most of the floor. Lava flows through an exit to the northeast. Stone passages open to the northwest, west, and south.
^5ba

One [flamewrath](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/flamewrath-pota.md) watches from the tunnel labeled "a," while one [Eternal Flame priest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/eternal-flame-priest-pota.md) is positioned at the tunnel labeled "b." A [razerblast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/razerblast-pota.md) stands watch in the middle passage. (See chapter 7 for the cultists' statistics.) The guards attack intruders who fail to use the pass phrase, "Hail the heart of fire!"

#### Brass Plate

A small brass plate is embedded in the north wall of the middle passage, near where the razerblast stands watch. It has an indentation in the shape of a human hand. When pressed, the plate causes basalt pillars to rise from the lava, creating stepping stones between the floating disk and the middle passage. The pillars are hot when they first rise. A creature that comes into contact with a hot pillar for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3 (`1d6`) fire damage. After 1 minute, the pillars cool.

#### Lava Passage

The northeastern lava flow is only 4 feet lower than the ceiling of the passage through which it flows.

#### Development

The razerblast in area W2 takes the place of any guards slain here.

### W2. Sentry Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Half of this oddly shaped chamber is set higher than the other half, as if it cracked and shifted a few feet upward. A natural pillar is the only feature of the upper level. In the center the lower level, a vortex of flame jets from the floor toward the ceiling. Numerous exits head off in different directions around the perimeter.
^5c0

One [razerblast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/razerblast-pota.md) (see chapter 7) and one [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) lounge here, off duty from keeping watch over area W1. When the characters first enter this chamber, the fire giant is dozing on the upper shelf. The razerblast sits near the jet of flame, treating it like a campfire.

#### Hidden Exit

The passageway toward area W5 is hidden behind the basalt pillar and positioned high up along the wall. A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher notices it. Otherwise, the characters have to look in the right place. Crude holds are cut into the pillar and the wall, so they can be climbed like a ladder to the passage.

#### Treasure

The giant has a satchel made of chain mail. Inside are 600 gp, thirteen bloodstones worth 50 gp, and a [potion of invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invisibility.md).

### W3. Causeway

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber's lower reaches are filled with lava. An uneven stone causeway spans the lava, ending at a narrow ledge along the eastern wall. Hanging from a pair of stout chains near the western tunnel is a large brass gong.
> 
> To the north, lava flows out through a wide passage, the magma almost toughing the ceiling there. To the south is a similar passage, but the ceiling there is a few feet higher than the lava.
^5c5

[Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) sacrifices prisoners here by forcing them to cross the causeway to the eastern ledge, then ringing the gong to alert the molten roper in area W4.

#### Causeway

The causeway is 3 to 5 feet wide and has no railing. Its surface is rough and uneven. If the characters go out on the causeway, see area W4.

#### Gong

The gong creates a loud, reverberating tone that can be easily heard within 100 feet. If the characters strike the gong, see area W4.

#### Lava Passages

The southern lava flow is only 4 feet lower than the ceiling of the passage through which it flows. To the north, the gap between lava and ceiling is only a few inches.

### W4. Pool of Lava

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The causeway hugs the east wall, narrowing as it travels north until it finally peters out. The magma hisses and roils, and flames dance on its surface.
^5cb

A [roper](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/molten-magma-roper-pota.md) made of molten magma lurks in the middle of the lava pool, peeking up occasionally or rising to the sound of the gong. It has immunity to fire damage and vulnerability to cold damage, and its bite attack deals fire damage instead of piercing damage. A hit from the roper's tendril deals 4 (`1d8`) fire damage, and a creature takes the same damage each time it ends its turn [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the roper.

When the roper uses its Reel action, it pulls creatures it is grappling into the lava. Because of the lava, the roper has a challenge rating of 11 (7,200 XP).

### W5. Chamber of Skulls

This chamber sits at the high point of this part of the fire node. Both passages leading into it (from area W2 and area W7) rise toward it at a thirty-degree angle. A bizarre play of multicolored flickering light is visible before the characters enter.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The steep passage opens into a chamber with a convex floor. Scores of humanoid skulls, most of them scorched and charred, are stuffed into niches in the walls. Many of them burn with flames, each varying in color, casting the entire chamber in bizarre light.
^5cd

Because of the convex floor, characters standing at an entryway can't see the other exits.

#### Flaming Skulls

Most of the skulls are ordinary skulls with [continual flame](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on them. However, four of the skulls are actually [flameskulls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md). They attack if the prisoners in area W6 try to escape. Otherwise, they remain motionless.

#### Fumes

Due to the height of the room relative to the rest of the node, toxic fumes collect here. Whenever a creature starts its turn inside the room, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Holding one's breath doesn't negate the effects.

#### Hidden Levers

Levers are hidden in secret niches behind skulls at the points marked "c" and "d" on the map. Finding a lever requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Pulling either lever opens a small vent in the center of the ceiling, and natural air currents draw the fumes out of the chamber in a few moments. Characters to notice the steady airflow. The vent closes again 1 minute after a lever is pulled, and the chamber refills with fumes after 5 minutes.

#### Shaft

An alcove in the north wall contains an 8-foot-diameter shaft that leads 30 feet down to area W6. Read the following if the characters look into the shaft:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Intense heat and light radiate up from the bottom of this smooth-sided shaft, and the crackle of flames is easily discernible from below. A chain ladder is coiled up near the hole, one end attached to the wall.
^5d3

Characters can descend the shaft using the chain ladder without needing to make an ability check.

### W6. Prison

This room is 30 feet below area W5 and accessible via a vertical shaft. Once a character reaches the bottom of the shaft, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This rough, circular cave is painfully hot. A curved wall of fire stretches from floor to ceiling and leaves only five feet between it and the surrounding walls.
^5d5

The ceiling here is 20 feet high. The fire is a ring-shaped [wall of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md) spell made permanent (until dispelled) by [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md). A creature that ends its turn in this room but outside the ring takes `5d8` fire damage. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

[Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) can control this wall, lowering it (or parts of it) to deposit or extract prisoners and then raising it again. The wall radiates no heat inside the ring, so the prisoners are unharmed while they remain there.

#### Prisoners

Four prisoners are here and awaiting their fate as sacrifices. The prisoners include two Waterdhavian caravan merchants named Kharloss and Jarlee (use the [noble](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) statistics), a [Crushing Wave reaver](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/crushing-wave-reaver-pota.md) named Dirana, and a moon elf [druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) named Teresiel. They have been stripped of their armor and weapons, which the cultists tossed into the lava.

Kharloss and Jarlee are willing to pay up to 500 gp for an escort to any town in the Dessarin Valley. They're honest. However, it takes several tendays to acquire the necessary coin from their holdings in Waterdeep.

Dirana is willing to trade information. She can sketch a basic map of the Temple of the Crushing Wave and the Plunging Torrents. She hasn't been to either place in several tendays and doesn't know who or what inhabits most of the chambers.

Teresiel is a member of the Emerald Enclave. She managed to conceal on her person a tiny leather packet that holds nine yellow seeds. Under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, each seed radiates an aura of conjuration magic. Plating a seed in fertile earth causes it grow into an [awakened tree](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) after `1d6` rounds. The awakened tree understands one language known to its creator and follows its creator's commands to the best of its ability. Teresiel doesn't relinquish with the seeds willingly and is determined to deliver them to the abbey at Goldenfields. She asks the characters to help her complete the delivery.

#### Development

If the characters leave any prisoners here, [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) sacrifices the remaining captives to the magma roper (area W4) within a day. If the prison is empty, the ring of fire is a low flame near the floor.

Characters captured within the node are stripped of their gear and brought here. If they fail to escape within 24 hours, [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) comes with the cultists in area W8, takes the prisoners to area W4, and feeds them to the magma roper

### W7. Breeding Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnel opens above a pool of lava, the surface of which is thirty feet below. A metal catwalk suspended 10 feet from the ceiling by iron chains connects to another tunnel on the far side, as well as to a stone column rising up from the magma. The catwalk passes through a hole in the column. In the lava below, serpentine creatures glide and splash. To the south, the lava cascades into the pool before the current continues down a channel to the north.
^5da

Four [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) and eight [fire snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) swim in the lava, which they use as a breeding pool. The salamanders lob their spears at anyone other than [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) and her guards who crosses the room, while the fire snakes have no way to attack creatures on the catwalks. If seriously wounded, the salamanders and fire snakes dive below the lava and remain out of sight.

#### Catwalk

The catwalk has no rail and shakes as people move across it, but it's sturdy.

#### Treasure

Inside the column is a rock that has the symbol of fire carved into it. A character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher notices it. Under the rock is a small brass box—one of [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md)'s emergency stashes—containing two [potions of greater healing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) and a [potion of gaseous form](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md).

### W8. Fire Shrine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Basalt pillars rise from the glassy floor of this circular cave to support a smooth domed ceiling. Niches carved into the columns hold dancing flames that illuminate copper tapestries hanging on the walls. Each tapestry bears the symbol of the fire cult. Just in front of a wide exit tunnel stands a dais with an altar atop it. Before the altar kneel three cultists, two in robes and one encased in armor.
> 
> To the north and south are smaller chambers attached to the shrine. An ornate privacy screen blocks the view to the north. The southern room is circular and lavishly decorated.
^5df

If the efreeti from the Temple of Eternal Flame (see chapter 4) has withdrawn to its abode (area W9), it is visible to any character who enters this room.

This room serves as a place of reflection and worship. Two [Eternal Flame priests](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/eternal-flame-priest-pota.md) and one [razerblast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/razerblast-pota.md) (see chapter 7 for both) are praying to [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md) when the characters first arrive. Unless the characters are disguised as fire cultists, they are attacked on sight. The efreeti, if present, also joins the battle.

#### Treasure

Seven tapestries worth 50 gp each adorn the walls.

### W9. Efreeti Lair

The [efreeti](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) from area E13 in the Temple of Eternal Flame (see chapter 4) lives here.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Colorful carpets and throw pillows are scattered across the floor, while a sumptuous feast is laid out on an obsidian table along the far wall. Under it is an ornate chest. A divan with finely woven cloth coverlets and pillows sits along the north side. Small jets of flame that emerge from the walls at regular intervals light the place.
^5e2

The furnishings here are made of materials immune to fire. The food on the table is edible and delicious.

#### Treasure

The chest contains 750 gp, a [potion of speed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-speed.md), and a tin tube containing a [scroll](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of [immolation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/immolation-xge.md) (see appendix B).

### W10. Vanifer's Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the privacy screen is a comfortable bedchamber. Several pieces of suggestive art hang on the walls, and a number of risqué sculptures of humans, tieflings, and other creatures in the throes of passion adorn side tables. In the middle sits a bed with plush covers and many pillows. An armoire stands against a side wall.
^5e5

[Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) relaxes here and brings guests along when it suits her.

#### Treasure

An [elixir of health](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/elixir-of-health.md) is inside the pocket of a robe hanging in the armoire. Six paintings by a noted Calishite artist named Talik al'Hamud adorn the walls; the heat has ruined them, but they are still worth 25 gp apiece.

### W11. Flowing Lava

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stream of lava flows down this long, sloping chamber to an immense magma pool beyond, tumbling over a series of rock shelves. One enormous point of rock juts up and forward from the flow.
^5e8

A [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md), Halinaxus, sits upon the point of rock, contemplating whether he can abide serving the fire prophet. [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) and Halinaxus have a truce as they negotiate the terms of Halinaxus's assistance.

#### Roleplaying Halinaxus

The dragon is intrigued by the potential power of the cult. He considers how he might someday take over. Halinaxus also loves the prizes [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) has hinted at giving him, so he is willing to bide his time and watch events unfold.

Halinaxus has an unobscured view of the fire portal (area W12) and the causeway leading up to it. If he spots one or more party members not dressed like fire cultists, he alights from his perch and lands on the causeway to cut off their escape. He then demands that the characters plead or pay for their lives. The dragon is supremely arrogant and doesn't suffer any disrepect from puny humanoids. If flattered and bribed to his satisfaction, he scoops up his newly won treasures and returns to his perch.

#### Treasure

Halinaxus has accumulated a loose pile of loot. On his perch are 160 pp, eleven red garnets (100 gp each), a [potion of invulnerability](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-invulnerability.md), and a [wand of fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-fear.md).

### W12. Fire Portal

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This titanic cavern is filled with a lake of gently undulating magma. A rough, uneven causeway of natural rock leads out into the middle, to a point where two crooked pillars of glassy black rock jut up on either side of a great altar of the same stone. Just beyond the altar, a gargantuan stone colossus rises from the lava to its waist, its head thrown back as if in agony. Tears of lava stream down its face, and lava wells from its gaping mouth. Above the colossus's head hovers a great orb of fire and light—a miniature sun with motes of fire swirling around it. The ceiling is another twenty feet up, at least one hundred feet overhead.
^5ed

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/068-poa05-12.webp#center)

If [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) has been defeated, Halinaxus (see area W11) guards the fire portal and fights to the death to protect it. A [fire elemental myrmidon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental-myrmidon-mpmm.md) (see chapter 7) stands before the altar in plain view, rushing forward to attack anyone other than [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) who approaches the portal. If [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) has retreated to this cavern and the characters have defeated two other prophets, use the "Encounter with Vanifer" section. Use the "Encounter with Imix" section if [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) is the last remaining prophet. In either case, the myrmidon isn't present.

#### Encounter with Vanifer

[Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) (see chapter 7) stands before the obsidian altar, watched over by Halinaxus (see area W11). Incinerath, a [fire elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) with 150 hit points, protects [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md). The elemental considers itself an avatar of [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md). [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) prefers to let Halinaxus and Incinerath fight while she casts spells from behind a [wall of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md).

[Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) doesn't dissemble, ask for mercy, or try to escape. Instead, she is sly and contemptuous. Halinaxus and Incinerath are arrogant blowhards but fearless in battle.

If [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) is defeated, she turns to smoke with a mournful scream and dissipates. [Tinderstrike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinderstrike-pota.md) falls to the ground, and the portal remains.

#### Encounter with Imix

This encounter features the same antagonists as described in the "Encounter with Vanifer," above. When the characters arrive, [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md) holds [Tinderstrike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinderstrike-pota.md) aloft and cries, "With this key, I call forth my master, the Eternal Flame!" The fire portal flares, and a gout of flame strikes Incinerath. With a howl of glee, the elemental transforms into [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md) (see chapter 7). The Prince of Evil Elemental Fire then focuses on destroying the characters with little concern for the consequences to [Vanifer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vanifer-pota.md). [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md) wants to annihilate the characters, but he also knows he must keep the fire portal open. He summons fire elementals to aid him.

#### The Fire Portal

The fire portal is the giant ball of flame floating just above the head of the weeping colossus, 80 feet from the ground. It leads to the Elemental Plane of Fire, where [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md) dwells. [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md) attacks any enemy who comes through the portal. However, he can't pursue them into the world until the proper ritual is complete.

Characters can close the portal only by hurling [Tinderstrike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinderstrike-pota.md) into it. Once struck, the portal flares, consumes [Tinderstrike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinderstrike-pota.md), and implodes. It sucks all fire elementals, including [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md), back to the Elemental Plane of Fire. With the portal collapsed, the node gradually returns to its natural state. A small river of lava still flows from area W1 through areas W3, W4, W7, and W11 into area W12. The Weeping Colossus might remain, or the closing of the portal might shatter the stone titan.

## Concluding the Campaign

With at least one Prince of Elemental Evil down for the count and the others unable to reach the Material Plane through the nodes, the Dessarin Valley is safe from Elemental Evil, for now. Over the next few months, the region returns to its tranquil state. It's still a frontier, but monster predations and banditry decline. The weather returns to normal, even if the people of Red Larch point out that "normal weather means bad weather around here, and unpredictable besides."

Some tavern talk can be overheard about occupying the Haunted Keeps to scare away unwanted squatters, or razing the forts once and for all. No power in the valley has the soldiers to accomplish the task, so nothing comes of it unless the characters take action.

Remaining cultists slink away and disperse within a tenday of the cults' defeat. Bereft of leadership and reeling from the events, the cultists decide the Dessarin Valley isn't the place for them. Some go to nearby cities, especially Waterdeep and Neverwinter, and attempt to hide amid the bustle as they rebuild their ranks. Any monsters loyal to the cult are free to fend for themselves.

The characters can become involved in a mop-up effort against the cult remnants.

![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/princes-of-the-apocalypse/img/069-poa05-13.webp#center)

### Recovering from Defeat

If the characters fail to prevent a Prince of Elemental Evil from remaining in the world, all is not lost. The triumphant prince remains near the node for several weeks, reorganizing its cult and bringing the scattered remnants of the other cults to heel. This time allows the characters to plan a second assault.

The factions the characters are affiliated with take a more active role in thwarting Elemental Evil. Reports from characters who survived the first battle carry great weight with them, and it's possible that a faction was scrying near the node at just the right time and saw how the battle unfolded. If the characters need better gear or spells cast on their behalf, the factions get to work. No one wants a second assault to fail for lack of [potions of fire resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-fire-resistance.md), for example.

The ranks of the cult are depleted, and they can't be refilled until word spreads about the arrival of an elemental prince. Characters know what to expect, but the Prince of Elemental Evil is arrogant and disdainful enough to carry on just as he or she did in the first battle.

### Faction Actions

If the characters end the threat of Elemental Evil, the factions they're affiliated with are appropriately grateful and impressed. The characters can expect more tangible aid from the factions in the future. Were it not for the characters, the Dessarin Valley would be a bastion of evil that was bound to spread across the North.

A closer connection with faction leaders cuts both ways. If the characters stopped Elemental Evil in its tracks, just think of all the other threats and rivals one could deploy them against. The characters have proved themselves capable of mighty deeds, and now that's what the factions expect.

If the characters' victory was less complete, the factions goad them to finish the job. For example, the characters might have left elemental nodes open. All five factions are strident about getting those nodes closed, though their reasons, methods, and encouragements vary.

### Evil Dreams

The Elder Elemental Eye—whatever that power is—has suffered a telling defeat in the Dessarin Valley. However, it hasn't been completely expunged. The four cults were a promising incarnation of Elemental Evil, but they ultimately failed the test placed before them.

The next time the Elder Elemental Eye stirs in the Dessarin Valley, it doesn't choose relative newcomers like humans to do its bidding. It turns to the drow, who built it a shrine beneath the Sumber Hills thousands of years ago. The drow cult rises again, returns to the Fane of the Eye, and starts undermining drow society. If the drow fall under the sway of Elemental Evil, the surface world will need experienced characters to face this new threat.

Know anyone who fits that description?

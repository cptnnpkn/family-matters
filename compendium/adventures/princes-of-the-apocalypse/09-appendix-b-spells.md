# Appendix B: Spells
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, p. 230* 

This appendix presents new spells that you can make available to your players. Some of the spells are used by creatures in chapter 7.

It's up to you whether these spells are available at character creation, whether they are discovered over the course of the adventure, or whether they don't end up in the characters' hands at all. Many players are fine sticking with the spells in the *Player's Handbook*, whereas other players will be excited to gain new spell options.

## Traits

**Crushing Wheels** The Demon Grinder can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the creature was already [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), it takes an extra 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage. This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons** The Demon Grinder's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency** If the Demon Grinder rolls over and falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until flipped upright.

## Action Stations

Any nonmagical items the target was holding or carrying are destroyed as well.

**Wrecking Ball (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover)** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 40 (`8d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. Double the damage if the target is an object or a structure.

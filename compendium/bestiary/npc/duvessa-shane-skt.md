*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 248*  

The daughter of a Waterdhavian trader and a tavern server, Duvessa has her mother's talent for negotiation and her father's charm. As the first woman to serve as Town Speaker of Bryn Shander, and a young one at that, she has much to prove.

Ideal:"The people of Icewind Dale are survivors. They can weather any storm."

Bond:"My mother taught me what it means to be a good leader. I won't disappoint her."

Flaw:"I don't give an inch in any argument or conflict."

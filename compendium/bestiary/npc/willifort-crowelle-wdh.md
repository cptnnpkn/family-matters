"traits":
- "desc": "Willifort can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid\
    \ it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size,\
    \ are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.\
    \ It reverts to its true form if it dies."
  "name": "Shapechanger"
- "desc": "In the first round of a combat, Willifort has advantage on attack rolls\
    \ against any creature it surprised."
  "name": "Ambusher"
- "desc": "If Willifort surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the\
    \ first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the\
    \ attack."
  "name": "Surprise Attack"
"actions":

- "desc": "Willifort magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60\
    \ feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2\
    \ feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the\
    \ target is in range, Willifort can continue reading its thoughts, as long as\
    \ Willifort's [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\
    \ isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind,\
    \ Willifort has advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight))\
    \ and Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation),\
    \ and [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks against\
    \ the target."

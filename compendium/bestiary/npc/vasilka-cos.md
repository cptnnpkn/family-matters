    \ On a 6, Vasilka goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, Vasilka attacks\
    \ the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and\
    \ attack, Vasilka attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than\
    \ itself. Once Vasilka goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed\
    \ or regains all its hit points.\n\nVasilka's creator, if within 60 feet of the\
    \ berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. Vasilka\
    \ must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma\
    \ ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the check\
    \ succeeds, Vasilka ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40\

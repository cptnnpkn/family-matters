    \ At the start of each of its turns, Xazax decides which way the cone faces and\

- "desc": "Xazax shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll\
    \ duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:\n\
    \n- 1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Xazax\
    \ for 1 hour, or until Xazax harms the creature.  \n- 2. Paralyzing Ray. The\
    \ targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 3. Fear Ray. The targeted\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 4. Slowing Ray. The\
    \ targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't\
    \ take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn,\
    \ not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 5. Enervation Ray.\
    \ The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36\
    \ (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful\
    \ one.  \n- 6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or Xazax moves it up to 30 feet in any direction.\
    \ It is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the ray's\
    \ telekinetic grip until the start of Xazax's next turn or until Xazax is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).\
    \  \n\n    If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being\
    \ worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. Xazax can also\
    \ exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool\
    \ or opening a door or a container.  \n- 7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature\
    \ must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes\
    \ an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n-\
    \ 8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is\
    \ [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). It must repeat\
    \ the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.\
    \ On a failure, the creature is [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.  \n- 9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force\
    \ damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes\
    \ a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical\
    \ object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw.\
    \ If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this\
    \ ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- 10. Death Ray. The targeted\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10)\
    \ necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  "

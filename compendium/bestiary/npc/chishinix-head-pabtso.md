- "desc": "The head targets one creature within 5 feet of itself and forces the target\
    \ to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the head enters the\
    \ target's space and attaches to the target. While the head is attached, the target\
    \ takes 7 (3d4) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and the head\
    \ can't use Leech again until it detaches. It can detach itself by spending 5\
    \ feet of its movement. As an action, the target or a creature within 5 feet of\
    \ the target can detach the head by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check."

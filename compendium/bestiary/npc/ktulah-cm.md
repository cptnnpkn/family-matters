# [K'Tulah](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/ktulah-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 64*  

K'Tulah is a gregarious tabaxi, a catlike humanoid. She arrived at Candlekeep six days ago and received permission to use the library to conduct her research on regional forms of folk magic.

She is an animated talker whose exaggerated gesticulations while chatting annoy Varnyr, but the elf appreciates her academic expertise.

    \ When the paralysis ends, the target is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ of the knight for 1 minute. The [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage\

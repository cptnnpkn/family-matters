# [Marlos Urnrayle](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/marlos-urnrayle-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 199*  

Marlos Urnrayle is the earth prophet of Elemental Evil and the leader of the Black Earth cult in the Sumber Hills. He is a medusa of unusual power who was once a vain and cruel human nobleman. Marlos delights in petrifying his foes, especially those of great physical beauty, and smashing the remains to rubble.

Marlos wields the magical war pick Ironfang, which he found in the Fane of the Eye after being drawn to the spot by a vision. Because of his medusa curse and his possession of the elemental weapon, the other Black Earth cultists believe that he stands high in Ogrémoch's favor and are fanatically loyal to him.

## In the Earth Node

When the Temple of Black Earth is threatened, Marlos Urnrayle retreats to the Black Geode, the earth node. Within this node, Marlos gains one additional use of his Legendary Resistance trait.

    \ a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\

    \ on [earthquake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md), initiative count 20\

# [Olhydra](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/olhydra-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 218*  

Olhydra is the Princess of Evil Water. Sometimes known as the Crushing Wave, the Dark Tide, or the Well of Endless Anguish, she takes the form of a great wave, 20 feet high and 15 feet wide, with opalescent eyes. She prefers to remain in or near large bodies of water-seas, lakes, rivers, or sometimes great subterranean pools. When she needs to, she can surge onto dry land, moving much like a wave rushing up onto the shore, but only great anger or desperation would drive Olhydra to move more than a few hundred feet from her native element.

Olhydra surges forth tirelessly and relentlessly. She delights in creating dangerous and destructive manifestations of elemental water, especially maelstroms and floods. She is eager to assert her power by smashing any vessel that dares to venture into her realm, and lays waste to villages or towns established within her reach. Olhydra erodes that which she can't batter and drown; she is patient, retreating in the face of adversity only to return stronger than before.

Of all the Princes of Elemental Evil, Olhydra is the one most interested in mortals. She recognizes that pirates and raiders who redden the waters with mortal blood (and occasionally send treasure-laden ships into her clutches) are agents of her hateful outlook, whether they know it or not. Consequently, Olhydra sometimes spares the worst sort of seafarers from her wrath, patiently waiting for the day when they deliver others into her power.

## Olhydra's Lair

The Princess of Evil Water is native to the Elemental Plane of Water, where she can be found in the black depths of vast seas or enthroned among jagged reefs. Olhydra waits for the chance to enter the Material Plane through elemental water nodes or when called by the proper rituals. Whether she is in her elemental domain or temporarily occupying a water node, Olhydra commands the waters around her and can shape them to her will.

  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Violent downpours become frequent within 10 miles of the lair. A downpour\
    \ occurs once every 2d12 hours, and lasts 1d3 hours. Downpours are so heavy\
    \ that creatures moving overland travel at half normal speed  \n- Within 5 miles\
    \ of the lair, currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any\
    \ ability checks made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these\
    \ waters has disadvantage.  \n- Aquatic creatures that have an Intelligence score\
    \ of 2 or lower within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw when they enter the area. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is\
    \ [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) and attempts to\
    \ leave the area, remaining [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ while within it. On a failure, the creature becomes highly aggressive and remains\
    \ in the area for 24 hours. While in this state, the creature gains advantage\
    \ on saving throws against charm and fear effects.  \n- Natural springs and pools\
    \ within 1 mile of the lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of\
    \ Water, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those\
    \ points.  "

# [Imix](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/imix-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 214*  

Imix, the Eternal Flame and the All-Consuming Fire, is the Prince of Evil Fire. His natural form resembles a 30-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide pillar of fire with smoldering black pits for eyes. Imix rarely speaks, but he crackles and roars with terrible laughter as anything combustible within his grasp bursts into flame and feeds his hate. Mortal beings are mere objects of contempt to Imix, and he burns alive any he can catch for nothing more than the wicked glee of watching them writhe and die in his flames.

Like his native element, Imix is fickle, temperamental, and highly destructive. Anything combustible stokes his hunger, but he takes special delight in feeding on the handiwork and possessions of intelligent beings, such as crops, buildings, or goods. Imix doesn't even spare his own followers or those who placate him with gifts and sacrifices-he is capricious and unpredictable, and often turns on those who think they have earned his favor.

## Imix's Lair

Imix's home is a fiery inverted pyramid within a volcano on the Elemental Plane of Fire. This fortress-palace is known as the Temple of Ultimate Consumption. Imix is quick to answer calls from the Material Plane, since he hungers eternally for new forests, plains, and kingdoms to burn.

    \ on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or in any elemental fire node (such as the Weeping\

  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Any fires in the lair flare up drastically, quadrupling in size (for\
    \ example, a fire blazing in a 5-foot by 5-foot area expands to a 10-foot by 10-foot\
    \ area). Pools or streams of lava or other molten material are also affected.\
    \ Creatures caught in the area of an expanded fire are subject to the normal damage\
    \ for entering or being in the fire. Creatures caught by a sudden flood of lava\
    \ must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone),\
    \ in addition to the normal damage for contact with molten rock.  \n- A thick\
    \ cloud of black smoke and burning embers fills a 40-foot-radius sphere within\
    \ 120 feet of Imix, lasting until initiative count 20 of the next round. Creatures\
    \ and objects within or beyond the smoke are heavily obscured. A creature that\
    \ enters the cloud of embers for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there\
    \ takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.  \n- A [wave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wave.md)\
    \ of searing heat fills the lair in a 300-foot radius around Imix for an instant.\
    \ Each creature other than Imix in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\
    \ saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. Creatures that take fire damage from\
    \ this effect gain one level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).\
    \ In addition, there is a fifty percent chance that any container of fluid held\
    \ or carried by an affected creature (for example, a magic potion) is destroyed.\

"regional_effects":
- "desc": "The region containing an elemental node in which Imix is present becomes\

  "name": ""
- "desc": "- A dry, baking heat [wave](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/wave.md) strikes the\
    \ region within 10 miles of Imix's location. At first, effects are minor - grass\
    \ turns brown, animals become listless, work and travel become very tiring. The\
    \ longer Imix remains, the worse the heat becomes; after 5 days, crops die and\
    \ ponds dry up; after 10 days, unprotected livestock dies, and wells and small\
    \ rivers dry up; after 20 days, large lakes and rivers are reduced in depth by\
    \ 20 feet and shrink accordingly.  \n- Wildfires erupt within a 5-mile radius\
    \ of Imix's lair. Every hour, there is a ten percent chance that characters in\
    \ this area are caught in the path of a wildfire moving 50 feet per round. Each\
    \ character must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6)\
    \ fire damage. A wildfire continues to threaten the characters for 1d10 rounds\
    \ or until they get out of its path. Wooden structures caught in the wildfire\
    \ are destroyed.  \n- Lava fountains erupt from the ground within 1 mile of Imix's\
    \ lair. Every hour, there is a ten percent chance that characters in this area\
    \ are close enough to an erupting lava fountain to be in danger. A lava fountain\
    \ creates a vent 20 feet in diameter, and hurls globs of lava up to 200 feet away.\
    \ Each character within this area must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw\
    \ or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage. A fountain\
    \ lasts for 2d10 rounds before subsiding.  \n- Wildfires or volcanic fissures\
    \ within 1 mile of Imix's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane\
    \ of Fire, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those\
    \ points.  "

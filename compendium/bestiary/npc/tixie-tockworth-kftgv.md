# [Tixie Tockworth](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/tixie-tockworth-kftgv.md)
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 85*  

Using magic and mechanical know-how, Tixie Tockworth has transformed most of herself into a machine. What was once her torso is now a steel carapace that can discharge jets of scalding steam. Her left arm ends in a humming blade. Her right arm ends in a metal shield. Her eyes are shiny, metallic red orbs that can see through illusions.

In her current form, Tockworth ruthlessly seeks to destroy anyone and anything that stands in the way of her ultimate goal, which is to become a Construct. If she's allowed to continue her work, she will achieve this apotheosis in a matter of weeks, after which her creature type changes to Construct. She also gains immunity to poison damage, as well as immunity to the paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions. Her statistics are otherwise unchanged.

# [Lady Gondafrey](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/lady-gondafrey-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 152*  

Lafy Gondafrey is the result of a magical experiment, a gargoyle that has been imbued with the personality of a human knight of Tyr (god of justice). Manshoon is amused by the creature so keeps it alive and locked in a cell.

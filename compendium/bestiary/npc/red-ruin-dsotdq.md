# [Red Ruin](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 208*  

Known for her incredible awareness and reflexes, the dragonnel-flying ace Red Ruin leads the Red Dragon Army's airborne forces. Her actual name is unknown, leading her allies to refer to her merely as "commander" or "Red Ruin"â€”a sobriquet earned after razing numerous targets from the air. She rarely removes her distinctive dragonnel-shaped helmet, leading to speculation about her actual identity. She also speaks little, relying on sharp hand gestures to direct dragonnel-riders in flight.

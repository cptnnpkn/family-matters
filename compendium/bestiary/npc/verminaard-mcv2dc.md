> As the Dragon Queen wills me to obey, here is my assessment of your servant, Verminaard of Nidus: Unchanged. The man remains a blustering dastard awash in blessings earned by his blood rather than his brains. He glories in Takhisis's favor and wields her power in manners both frivolous and brutal. In their bunks, his troops whisper of his zealotry and claim that those missing from their ranks have been sacrificed on his secret altar. I don't dismiss this possibility.

Dragon Highlord Verminaard leads the Red Dragon Army—the largest and most powerful of the Dragon Queen's forces—with fanatic zeal and ruthless might. Though prophesied to banish evil forces from the lands of Krynn, Verminaard was tempted by Takhisis and her promises of glory. Corrupted by the Dragon Queen, Verminaard rose to become one of her champions, claiming command of the fiercest among the Dragon Armies.

Verminaard's extreme devotion to Takhisis allows him to channel her unholy power on the battlefield, bolstering those under his command while raining cursed fire on his foes. His towering silhouette is often wreathed in the fire of Ember, his red dragon companion and adviser.

> [!note] Draconic Devotion
> 
> Verminaard's stat block references the Draconic Devotion monster trait. Though this trait does not appear in any of the creatures in this compendium, you will find several monsters with the Draconic Devotion trait terrorizing the lands of Krynn in the book Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen.

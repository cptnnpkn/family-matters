# [Murgaxor](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/murgaxor-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 180*  

After giving the characters their quest, Professor Lang hands them a file with information the faculty members have collected about Murgaxor from university records. Tell the players the following to give them context about this evil spellcaster:

- Murgaxor is a bullywug who attended Strixhaven 200 years ago. He was a member of Witherbloom College, though there are no records of him participating in any activities or working on campus.  
- A mean-spirited, egotistical spellcaster, Murgaxor was censured repeatedly for disregarding safety protocols, hexing and cursing peers, and using harmful magic while on campus.  
- University officials believe Murgaxor began his illicit experiments with life-draining magic shortly after he enrolled as a student.  
- In his third year, Murgaxor was expelled for using life-draining magic when it resulted in another student's death. Murgaxor fled before he could be handed over to authorities.  
- For a few years after his expulsion, Murgaxor was reportedly sighted around the outskirts of campus, specifically in Sedgemoor and the Detention Bog. Authorities believed something about those locations enhanced his magic, but he was never caught. Sightings soon stopped, and no further evidence of Murgaxor's presence was found. Offcials assumed he was dead and struck Murgaxor from Strixhaven's records, as they considered him a blot on the university's reputation.

    \ inanimate clay after 1 hour.  \n- Earthen Fist. A medium fist of packed\
    \ earth rises from the floor in an unoccupied space that Murgaxor can see within\
    \ 30 feet of him. The fist attacks when one creature of his choice is within 4\
    \ feet of the fist. The fist has a +11 bonus to hit, and on a hit, the target\
    \ takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 15). The fist\

    \ this lair action recharges, allowing Murgaxor to use it again.  \n- Necrotic\
    \ Burst. Tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from the ritual circle and lash out\
    \ at any number of creatures Murgaxor can see within 15 feet of the circle. Each\

    \ obey Murgaxor's commands, take their turns on initiative count 15 (losing initiative\
    \ ties), and fight until destroyed.  "

# [Eldrick Runeweaver](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md)
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 215*  

One of the finest professors in the Amethyst Academy, Eldrick Runeweaver has personally instructed a generation of talented arcane spellcasters. He is the foremost living expert on abjuration magic, but is also highly regarded within the Academy as a dedicated administrator and calculating leader. If Eldrick Runeweaver successfully retakes the Inscrutable Tower, he will likely take up the vacant spot in the Academy Directorate and assume the mantle of Archmage of Drakkenheim.

Eldrick Runeweaver is a towering and broad-shouldered man in his mid-sixties. His amber eyes glow softly behind his circular glasses, and he has a square-cut, greying black beard. He wears nine rings of silver, gold, and electrum: one on each finger except his left thumb. He wears flowing purple garb with golden embroidery, and carries an obsidian staff tipped with a delerium crystal.

-     - **Personality Trait.** I carefully calculate my every action, and I speak using a few well-chosen words. I'm a teacher at heart, so I often phrase my responses in the form of a pointed question.    
-     - **Ideal.** I will seek out more information whenever I encounter an unknown situation or problem. Through reason and logic, the facts always bear out the truth of the matter.    
-     - **Bond.** I hold a position of responsibility and authority within the Amethyst Academy, and it is my duty to protect the Academy's interests, carry out its agenda, and keep its many secrets.    
-     - **Flaw.** I care deeply for my students, but tend to overlook their faults and failures. I've had several wayward apprentices over the years, and I've often had to cover up their mistakes.    

Eldrick Runeweaver has a cat familiar, and travels with an iron golem bodyguard and a homunculus servant. He most often communicates via sending, telepathic bond, and project image spells, or by sending his simulacrum instead. Eldrick always has a contingency spell in place, and has a clone kept in a distant stronghold with extra equipment should the unthinkable occur.

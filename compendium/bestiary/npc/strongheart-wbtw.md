# [Strongheart](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/strongheart-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 228*  

Strongheart is a fearless seeker of justice, risking his life to ensure that good triumphs over evil. He is thoughtful, kind, and seldom rash, yet never hesitant to punish those who spit in the face of law and order.

Strongheart doesn't worship a god but devotes himself to an ideal: that the world can be spared from evil by those who have enough courage to stand against it.

## Zikzokrishka's Phylactery

Zikzokrishka hid her phylactery deep within the Scimitar Spires, a mountain range to the east of the necropolis of Azumar. If the characters defeat her, Zikzokrishka uses her phylactery to rematerialize, having long ago prepared a dragon's corpse to house her spirit upon its return to the phylactery.

- "desc": "Bonnie can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid\
    \ it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size,\

    \ It reverts to its true form if it dies."

    \ of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet\
    \ of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target\
    \ is in range, Bonnie can continue reading its thoughts, as long as Bonnie's [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\
    \ isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind,\
    \ Bonnie has advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight))\
    \ and Charisma ([Deception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation),\
    \ and [Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks against\

    \ saving throw or take 26 (4d12) cold damage and become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).\n\
    \nWhile [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way,\
    \ the creature can't regain hit points. At the end of every hour, the creature\
    \ must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).\
    \ If the creature is in direct sunlight when it makes this saving throw, it automatically\
    \ succeeds on the save.\n\nIf the creature is targeted by magic that ends a poison\
    \ or disease, such as lesser restoration, while the creature isn't in direct sunlight,\
    \ the effect does not end."

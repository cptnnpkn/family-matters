- "desc": "Shards of a [vorpal sword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/vorpal-sword.md) once\
    \ broken against the devil replace its claws. A successful DC 12 Intelligence\
    \ ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception))\
    \ check identifies them as such. When the devil rolls a 20 on an attack roll with\
    \ a claw, the target is decapitated. (At your option, the attack can instead deal\
    \ an extra 6d8 slashing damage.) A target is immune to this effect if it is\
    \ immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, doesn't have or need a head,\
    \ or if you decide that the target is too large for its head to be cut off by\
    \ the devil's claws. If removed, the shards lose their magical powers."

    \ succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\

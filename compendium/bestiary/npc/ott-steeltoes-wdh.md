*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 214*  

The dwarf Ott Steeltoes has the nerve-wracking task of tending to Xanathar's pet fish, Sylgar. In his spare time, he worships Zuggtmoy, the demon queen of fungi, and cultivates mushrooms, spores, and molds. He wears a leather skullcap stitched with fake beholder eyestalks.

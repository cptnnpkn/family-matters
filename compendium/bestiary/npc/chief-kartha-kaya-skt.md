- "desc": "Chief Kartha attempts to magically possess a humanoid or giant. Chief Kartha\
    \ must touch the target throughout a short rest, or the attempt fails. At the\
    \ end of the rest, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw\
    \ or be possessed by Chief Kartha, which disappears with everything it is carrying\
    \ and wearing. Until the possession ends, the target is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated),\
    \ loses control of its body, and is unaware of its surroundings. Chief Kartha\
    \ now controls the body and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,\
    \ and it retains its alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores;\
    \ and its proficiencies. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, except the\
    \ target's knowledge, class features, feats, and proficiencies.\n\nThe possession\
    \ lasts until either the body drops to 0 hit points, Chief Kartha ends the possession\
    \ as an action, or Chief Kartha is forced out of the body by an effect such as\
    \ the [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, Chief Kartha reappears in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 5 feet of the body and is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned)\
    \ until the end of its next turn. If the host body dies while it is possessed\
    \ by Chief Kartha, Chief Kartha dies as well, and its body doesn't reappear."

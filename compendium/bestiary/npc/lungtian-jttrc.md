    \ Lungtian can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\
    \nAt will: [druidcraft](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/druidcraft.md)\n\n1/day\
    \ each: [barkskin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/barkskin.md), [pass without trace](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/pass-without-trace.md),\

  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "Lungtian has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical\
    \ effects."
  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "Lungtian can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language."
  "name": "Speak with Beasts and Plants"
- "desc": "Once on her turn, Lungtian can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically\
    \ into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within\
    \ 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of\
    \ the second tree. Both trees must be large or bigger."
  "name": "Tree Stride"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach\
    \ 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning\
    \ damage with shillelagh."
  "name": "Club"
- "desc": "Lungtian targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet\
    \ of her. If the target can see Lungtian, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or be magically [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed).\
    \ The [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature regards\
    \ Lungtian as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target\
    \ isn't under Lungtian's control, it takes Lungtian's requests or actions in the\
    \ most favorable way it can.\n\nEach time Lungtian or its allies do anything harmful\
    \ to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on\
    \ a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Lungtian dies, is on\
    \ a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus\
    \ action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to Lungtian's\
    \ Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.\n\nLungtian can have no more than one humanoid\
    \ and up to three beasts [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ at a time."

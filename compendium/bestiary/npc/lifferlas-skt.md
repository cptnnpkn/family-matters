# [Lifferlas](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/lifferlas-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 250*  

A druid of the Emerald Enclave awakened the tree Lifferlas with a spell. Goldenfields is his home, its people his friends. Children like to carve their names and initials into his body and hang from his boughs, and he's happy with that.

Ideal:"I exist to protect the people and plants of Goldenfields."

Bond:"Children are wonderful. I would do anything to make them feel happy and safe."

Flaw:"I can't remember people's names and often get them mixed up."

- "desc": "Joster Mareet ignores the range restriction on its telepathy when communicating\
    \ with a creature it has [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed).\
    \ The two don't even need to be on the same plane of existence."
  "name": "Telepathic Bond"
- "desc": "Joster Mareet can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid,\
    \ or back into its true form. Without wings, Joster Mareet loses its flying speed.\
    \ Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any\
    \ equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true\
    \ form if it dies."
  "name": "Shapechanger"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6\
    \ + 3) slashing damage."
  "name": "Claw (Fiend Form Only)"
- "desc": "One humanoid Joster Mareet can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on\
    \ a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ for 1 day. The [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target\
    \ obeys Joster Mareet's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any\
    \ harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending\
    \ the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect,\
    \ or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for\
    \ the next 24 hours.\n\nJoster Mareet can have only one target [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends."
  "name": "Charm"
- "desc": "Joster Mareet kisses a creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving\
    \ throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum\
    \ is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until\
    \ the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its\
    \ hit point maximum to 0."
  "name": "Draining Kiss"
- "desc": "Joster Mareet magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane,\
    \ or vice versa."

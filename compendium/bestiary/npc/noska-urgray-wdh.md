# [Noska Ur'gray](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/noska-urgray-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 213*  

Noska is a ruthless enforcer in the Xanathar Guild. A green slime in Undermountain dissolved his left hand and forearm, and the lost appendage has been replaced with a heavy crossbow that attaches to the stump.

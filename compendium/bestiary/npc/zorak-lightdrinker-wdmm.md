- "desc": "Augrek has advantage on saving throws against poison."
  "name": "Dwarven Resilience"
- "desc": "If Zorak isn't in sunlight or running water, he can use his action to polymorph\
    \ into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form.\n\nWhile\
    \ in bat form, Zorak can't speak, his walking speed is 5 feet, and he has a flying\
    \ speed of 30 feet. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged.\
    \ Anything he is wearing transforms with it, but nothing he is carrying does.\
    \ He reverts to his true form if he dies.\n\nWhile in mist form, Zorak can't take\
    \ any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed\
    \ of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there.\
    \ In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing,\
    \ and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and\
    \ Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage, except\
    \ the damage he takes from sunlight."
  "name": "Shapechanger"
- "desc": "If Zorak fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead."
  "name": "Legendary Resistance (3/Day)"
- "desc": "When he drops to 0 hit points outside his resting place, Zorak transforms\
    \ into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious),\
    \ provided that he isn't in sunlight or running water. If he can't transform,\
    \ he is destroyed.\n\nWhile he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert\
    \ to his vampire form, and he must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be\
    \ destroyed. Once in his resting place, he reverts to his vampire form. He is\
    \ then [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) until he regains\
    \ at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his resting place with 0 hit\
    \ points, he regains 1 hit point."
  "name": "Misty Escape"
- "desc": "Zorak regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least\
    \ 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Zorak takes radiant damage\
    \ or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Zorak's\
    \ next turn."
  "name": "Regeneration"
- "desc": "Zorak can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings,\
    \ without needing to make an ability check."
  "name": "Spider Climb"
- "desc": "Zorak has the following flaws:\n\nForbiddance. Zorak can't enter a residence\
    \ without an invitation from one of the occupants.\n\nHarmed by Running Water.\
    \ Zorak takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn in running water.\n\nStake to\
    \ the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Zorak's heart while\
    \ Zorak is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ in his resting place, Zorak is [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed)\
    \ until the stake is removed.\n\nSunlight Hypersensitivity. Zorak takes 20 radiant\
    \ damage when he starts his turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, he has disadvantage\
    \ on attack rolls and ability checks."
  "name": "Vampire Weaknesses"
"actions":
- "desc": "Zorak makes two attacks with his [dwarven thrower](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dwarven-thrower.md),\
    \ only one of which can be a ranged attack."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60\
    \ ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, or 12 (1d10 + 7)\
    \ bludgeoning damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack. On a ranged\
    \ attack that hits, the hammer deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage (2d8\
    \ if the target is a giant). Hit or Miss: If thrown, the weapon flies back to\
    \ Zorak's hand after the attack."
  "name": "Dwarven Thrower"
- "desc": "Zorak makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack."
  "name": "Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8\
    \ (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Zorak can grapple\
    \ the target (escape DC 18)."
  "name": "Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature,\
    \ or a creature that is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled)\
    \ by Zorak, [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated),\
    \ or [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). Hit: 7 (1d6\
    \ + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point\
    \ maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Zorak\
    \ regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target\
    \ finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces his hit point maximum\
    \ to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following\
    \ night as a [vampire spawn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn.md)\
    \ under Zorak's control."
  "name": "Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)"
- "desc": "Zorak targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of it. If the target\
    \ can see Zorak, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against\
    \ this magic or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by\
    \ Zorak. The [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target regards\
    \ Zorak as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't\
    \ under Zorak's control, it takes Zorak's requests or actions in the most favorable\
    \ way it can, and it is a willing target for Zorak's bite attack.\n\nEach time\
    \ Zorak or Zorak's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat\
    \ the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect\
    \ lasts 24 hours or until Zorak is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence\
    \ than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect."
  "name": "Charm"
- "desc": "Zorak magically calls 2d4 swarms of [bats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-bats.md)\
    \ or [rats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md), provided that the\
    \ sun isn't up. While outdoors, Zorak can call 3d6 [wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/wolf.md)\
    \ instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Zorak\
    \ and obeying his spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Zorak dies,\
    \ or until Zorak dismisses them as a bonus action."

"regional_effects":
- "desc": "The region surrounding a vampire's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural\
    \ presence, creating any of the following effects:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves\
    \ in the region.  \n- Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems\
    \ and branches become twisted and thorny.  \n- Shadows cast within 500 feet of\
    \ the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.  \n- A creeping\
    \ fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally\
    \ takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.  "

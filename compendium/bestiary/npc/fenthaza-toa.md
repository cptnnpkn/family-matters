    \ fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a DC 13 Intelligence\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage\
    \ and is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the\
    \ manifestation, believing it to be real. Fenthaza must concentrate to maintain\
    \ the illusion (as if concentrating on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute\
    \ and can't be harmed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each\
    \ of its turns, ending the illusion on a success, or taking 11 (2d10) psychic\
    \ damage on a failure."

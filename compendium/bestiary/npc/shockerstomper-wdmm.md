- "desc": "When a leg drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled, and Shockerstomper can\
    \ use a reaction to detach it from its main body. Whenever one of its legs is\
    \ disabled, Shockerstomper's walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. The whole contraption\
    \ topples over and shuts down if four of its seven legs are disabled."
  "name": "Disable"
- "desc": "A creature that ends its turn in contact with Shockerstomper's body (saucer\
    \ or turrets) must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10)\

    \ check or Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception))\
    \ check. As an action, a character can try to open the control module's access\
    \ panel, either by tearing it off with a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
    \ check or by dislodging it with thieves' tools and a successful DC 25 Dexterity\
    \ check. Behind the panel, embedded in the floor of the control module, is a 5-foot-diameter\
    \ pulsating crystal hemisphere with AC 10, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison\

    \ rock or similar object, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\

    \ to try to clear the obstruction, which requires another successful DC 15 Strength\

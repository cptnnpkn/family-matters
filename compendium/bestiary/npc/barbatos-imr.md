    \ (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following ranger\
    \ spells prepared:\n\n1st level (4 slots): [ensnaring strike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ensnaring-strike.md),\
    \ [hail of thorns](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hail-of-thorns.md), [hunter's mark](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hunters-mark.md)\n\
    \n2nd level (2 slots): [locate animals or plants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-animals-or-plants.md)"
  "name": "Spellcasting"
- "desc": "Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits Barbatos corrodes. After\
    \ dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage\
    \ rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition\
    \ made of metal that hits Barbatos is destroyed after dealing damage."
  "name": "Rust Monster Cloak"
- "desc": "Barbatos regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn. If Barbatos takes\
    \ acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of Barbatos's\
    \ next turn. Barbatos dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't\
    \ regenerate."
  "name": "Heart of the Troll"
"actions":
- "desc": "Barbatos makes two bone shortsword attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6\
    \ + 3) piercing damage."
  "name": "Bone Shortsword"
- "desc": "Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit:\
    \ 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution\
    \ saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\
    \ for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).\
    \ The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes\
    \ an action to shake it."
  "name": "Light Crossbow"
- "desc": "Barbatos corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object he can see within 5\
    \ feet of himself. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys\
    \ a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the\
    \ creature can make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid Barbatos's touch.\n\
    \nIf the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or\
    \ carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative 1 penalty to the AC it offers.\
    \ Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.\
    \ If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in Barbatos's\
    \ Rust Monster Cloak trait."

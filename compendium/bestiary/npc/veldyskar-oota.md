- "desc": "If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of Veldyskar and the two of\
    \ them can see each other, Veldyskar can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution\
    \ saving throw if Veldyskar isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).\
    \ On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\
    \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the\
    \ effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.\n\nA creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes\
    \ to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't\
    \ see Veldyskar until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.\
    \ If it looks at Veldyskar in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\
    \nIf Veldyskar sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes\
    \ itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze."

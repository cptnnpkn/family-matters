# [Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/keyleth-voice-of-the-tempest-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 263*  

## Vox Machina

Heroes. Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, "Wildemount", "Issylra", and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of "Stilben" to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.

The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.

Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the "Tal'Dorei Council", shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.

Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the [Vestiges of Divergence](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/vestiges-of-divergence-by-advancement-tdcsr.md), whose power they unlocked in the battles against the "Cinder King" and The Whispered One, are still within their grasp.

The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a "quest giver," for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.

## Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest

Many painters across Tal'Dorei have depicted the stoic, melancholy visage of Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest, as she stands at the edge of a lofty cliff of "Zephrah", gazing into the rosy sunset beside a pink-blossomed tree. In this image, people see a leader who has lost much—and sacrificed even more—for her people, for her world, and for the family she found on her journeys.

### Hidden Heart

Though Keyleth often looks back on the life she left behind, she does not dwell on the past. She remembers the joy and pain in equal measure, keeping her eyes on the horizon to seek the next sunrise, not the sunset. In public, she is a consummate leader, speaking tactfully, with calculated words and poise. Yet when she's with her friends from the old days, particularly [Pike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/pike-trickfoot-tdcsr.md), [Percival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md), and [Vex'ahlia](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md), her practiced public face falls away, revealing the same eager, enthusiastic, idealistic Keyleth that she's always been—just with a few more sorrows weighing upon her heart. She keeps a humble home in "Whitestone" near "Grey Hunt Manor", close to a "hidden forest trail she can walk down in peace, conjuring snowdrops as she goes".

### After the Epilogue

Keyleth buried herself in her duties as Voice of the Tempest after the loss of [Vax'ildan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md) and The Whispered One's defeat. She did everything she could to ally the Air Ashari with the rest of Tal'Dorei, and to create a world better prepared to unite against threats like The Whispered One and the "Chroma Conclave". Her heroic reputation, her political will, and her mighty elemental magic gained her many allies, but the entrenched elite of Tal'Dorei still see her as a potential threat to their stability. She rarely adventures anymore, preferring to hire others to tackle problems she sees arising across Tal'Dorei. But if the world is ever in need of an archdruid, she will answer the call.

# [Urstul Floxin](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/urstul-floxin-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 216*  

Urstul Floxin works for Manshoon, and he is the highest-ranking member of the Zhentarim squad stationed at House Gralhund. Urstul is a glorified thug with all the charm and breeding of a snake, but the Gralhunds tolerate him because he feeds them useful information culled from his spies throughout the city. Urstul takes his orders from Manshoon's current simulacrum, which comes and goes from House Gralhund by way of a teleportation circle (connected to the circle in Kolat Towers).

Urstul is a large, heavyset man in his forties. He storms about House Gralhund like he owns the place. He has a collection of black flying snakes that he uses as couriers to deliver messages to underlings throughout the city.

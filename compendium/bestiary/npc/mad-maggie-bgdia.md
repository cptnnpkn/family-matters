- "desc": "Maggie's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6\
    \ to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring\
    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md),\
    \ [magic missile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-missile.md)\n\n2/day each:\
    \ [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only), [ray of enfeeblement](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ray-of-enfeeblement.md),\
    \ [sleep](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sleep.md)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "Maggie has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical\
    \ effects."
  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself.\
    \ If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve\
    \ it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.\n\nHeartstone: This lustrous\
    \ black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession.\
    \ The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes\
    \ 30 days.\n\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's\
    \ Nightmare Haunting, Maggie catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched\
    \ flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night\
    \ hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes\
    \ 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag)."
  "name": "Night Hag Items"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13\
    \ (2d8 + 4) slashing damage."
  "name": "Claws (Hag Form Only)"
- "desc": "Maggie magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or\
    \ back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment\
    \ she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if\
    \ she dies."
  "name": "Change Shape"
- "desc": "Maggie magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or\
    \ vice versa. To do so, Maggie must have a heartstone in her possession."
  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "While on the Ethereal Plane, Maggie magically touches a sleeping humanoid\
    \ on the Material Plane. A [protection from evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long\
    \ as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last\
    \ for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit\
    \ point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's\
    \ hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul\
    \ is trapped in Maggie's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum\
    \ lasts until removed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or similar magic."

# [Warduke](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/warduke-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 221*  

Warduke's services as a remorseless killer-for-hire can be easily bought. The evil swordsman serves Kelek as a cohort and adventuring companion from time to time. He isn't terribly bright, which is why he leaves the plotting and scheming to others.

What does Warduke look like under his dread helm? No one knows. He never removes his helmet to reveal his face to others, but the visage beneath is that of a grim, hideously scarred gladiator.

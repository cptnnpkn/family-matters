- "desc": "- Avandra's Grasp. Alyxian uses the power of Avandra's ruined temple\
    \ (area H2) to create a watery tendril that rises out of the lake. One creature\
    \ Alyxian can see that's not submerged in the lake must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity\
    \ saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by the tendril. The tendril is a Large object that has AC 10, 15 hit points,\
    \ and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The tendril disappears when it is\
    \ reduced to 0 hit points or the next time Alyxian takes a lair action.  \n- Corellon's\
    \ Charm. Alyxian causes a magical wisp of light to emerge from Corellon's ruined\
    \ temple (area H3). The wisp enters the body of one creature Alyxian can see that\
    \ isn't inside Corellon's ruined temple or atop the rocky island that supports\
    \ it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by Alyxian until initiative count 20 of the next round.  \n- Sehanine's Torment.\
    \ Alyxian uses the power of Sehanine's ruined temple (area H4) to create a watery\
    \ form in the space of one creature that is either standing on the lake or submerged\
    \ in it. The watery form assumes the vague likeness of the creature whose space\
    \ it occupies and makes one melee weapon attack (+7 to hit) against it. On a hit,\
    \ the attack deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Whether it hits or misses,\
    \ the watery form disappears after making its attack.  "

    \ in the deity's prayer site. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion))\
    \ check, and the check has advantage if the character is a worshiper of that god.\
    \ On a successful check, the profane ruins atop the island melt away, and Alyxian\
    \ can no longer use the lair action associated with that prayer site. In addition,\
    \ Alyxian takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage, regardless of his current form."

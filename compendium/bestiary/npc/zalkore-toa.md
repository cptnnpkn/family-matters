- "desc": "When a creature that can see Zalkoré's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet\
    \ of Zalkoré, Zalkoré can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if\
    \ Zalkoré isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature\
    \ is instantly [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified). Otherwise,\
    \ a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\
    \ The [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature must\
    \ repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until\
    \ the creature is freed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to\
    \ avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it\
    \ can't see Zalkoré until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes\
    \ again. If the creature looks at Zalkoré in the meantime, it must immediately\
    \ make the save.\n\nIf Zalkoré sees itself reflected on a polished surface within\
    \ 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, Zalkoré is, due to its curse,\
    \ affected by its own gaze."

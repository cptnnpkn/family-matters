# [Prisoner 13](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/prisoner-13-kftgv.md)
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 68*  

Prisoner 13 is a dwarf named Korda Glintstone. Prior to her incarceration years ago, Korda was an ally and agent of Clan Axebreaker, a moderately influential dwarf clan in a stronghold called Gauntlgrym. Korda built a network of informants and agents, ostensibly all to the benefit of Clan Axebreaker. With each success, she paid tattooists to inscribe a memorial of her triumph onto her skin. Using ancient rituals, Korda infused many of these artful etchings with the magic of Gauntlgrym's forges, granting her wondrous gifts.

Korda grew too ambitious for her role as an agent, so she devised a plan to take power for herself. Over five years she took careful stock of Clan Axebreaker's wealth and, in one fell swoop, used her network of lieutenants to steal away most of the clan's gold, leaving only a pittance.

Prisoner 13 is a cunning schemer, ruthless and patient. She listens and watches, absorbing every detail she can, and shares as little as she can get away with.

## Prisoner 13's Tattoos

Most of Prisoner 13's inkwork is covered by her uniform. Her tattoos include the following:

- **Dwarven Poetry..** An excerpt from a poem in Dwarvish script on her neck and across her shoulder blades reads, "Endless dreams entombed in stone."  
- **Flames..** A roiling storm of brilliant flames covers her back and ribs.  
- **Shroud..** Black and gray smoke and shadows coil down her left arm, ending in runes on the fingers of her left hand.  
- **Knotwork..** Purple and blue knotwork and runes run down her right arm, across the back of her right hand, and down the length of each finger. The runes on her fingers, known as the keystone tattoo, form the key to the vault in Gauntlgrym.  
- **Mountain..** Silver and brown mountain peaks cover her chest, the tips following the angles of her collarbones.  
- **River..** Swirling green and blue waters form a cascading river across her stomach, with scaly creatures leering from the water.  
- **Power and Plunder..** Dwarvish script on her hips reads "Power" and "Plunder.  

Traced among Prisoner 13's tattoos are tiny magical sigils, each one matching a twin tattooed on one of her agents. A character who examines any visible tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices some of the hidden marks.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check determines that the sigils have something to do with minds or telepathy.

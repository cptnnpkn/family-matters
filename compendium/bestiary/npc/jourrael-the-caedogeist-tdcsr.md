> Of the great, terrible legends born in the blood and fire of the Calamity, few managed to defy mortality and endure the ages as deftly as the assassin queen Jourrael. Blessed by shadow and death, they walk between realms, relishing the hunt and stalking their target tirelessly, unburdened by wall, gate, or door. Whatever poor soul finds the ire of the Caedogeist can only accept their 'Inevitable End.'

Jourrael is a nightmarish specter and ancient assassin of many names. The Spider Queen bestowed upon her the title of Caedogeist, the specter of silent death, while scholars describe Jourrael as "the Inevitable End," more certain than death. Those who catch a glimpse of her whisper of a shadowy wraith with hair like fire, who wields daggers dripping poison and walks through walls and mountains as if they were water.

## Death Forbidden

Jourrael cannot die. A contract between the Lord of the Hells and the Spider Queen forbids death from claiming the assassin, though many have tried—often in increasingly creative ways. At the "Calamity's" end, armies joined together to separate Jourrael's body into disparate parts. The Savalirwood "elves" took their head to Veluthil, while their heart was hidden in the Lotusden Greenwood under a dread [wraithroot tree](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/wraithroot-tree-tdcsr.md).

The mysterious fiend Obann falsely believed that after recovering and reviving Jourrael, he could control her indefinitely. Inevitably, Jourrael dealt a killing blow to Obann, sending him to the death she will never meet.

## Unbound Future

Alive and well, Jourrael still serves the Spider Queen. Their ghostly form and unmatchable stealth fuel the attacks of their spectral blade and void dagger, with few surviving that onslaught. They shrug off nature's elements and mortals' weapons, won't be held against their will, and know no fear. After having spent so long dismembered and sealed away, Jourrael is eager to see the world of Exandria—and to kill any creature they deem worthy of dying on their blades.

## Alignment

Chaotic evil.

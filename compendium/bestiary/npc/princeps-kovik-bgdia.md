    \ (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled)\
    \ (escape DC 14) if Kovik isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple\

  "name": "Chain"
- "desc": "Up to four chains Kovik can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged\
    \ barbs and animate under Kovik's control, provided that the chains aren't being\

    \ resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When\
    \ Kovik uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one\
    \ additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own\
    \ but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate\
    \ state if reduced to 0 hit points or if Kovik is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ or dies."

    \ Kovik can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's departed\
    \ loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see Kovik, it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ until the end of its turn."

# [Graz'zt](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/grazzt-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 148*  

The appearance of this demon lord is a warning that not all that is beautiful is good. Every plane and curve of his nine-foot-tall body, every glance of his burning eyes, promises a mixture of pleasure and pain. Graz'zt can transform himself at will, appearing in any humanlike form that pleases him or his onlookers, all equally tempting in their own ways. In every form, though, a subtle wrongness pervades his beauty, from the cruel cast of his features to the six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.

Graz'zt surrounds himself with the finest of things and the most attractive of servants, and he adorns himself in silks and leathers both striking and disturbing in their workmanship. His lair and those of his cultists are pleasure palaces where nothing is forbidden save moderation and kindness.

Cults devoted to him are secret societies of indulgence, often using their debauchery to subjugate others through blackmail, addiction, and manipulation. They wear alabaster masks with ecstatic expressions and ostentatious dress and body ornamentation to their secret assignations.

Although he prefers charm and subtle manipulation, Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence when provoked. He wields the greatsword Angdrelve, also called Wave of Sorrow, whose wavy, razor-edged blade drips acid at his command.

## Graz'zt's Lair

Graz'zt's principal lair is his Argent Palace, a grandiose structure in the city of Zelatar, found within his abyssal domain of Azzatar. Graz'zt's demonic influence radiates outward in a tangible ripple, warping reality around him. Given enough time in a single location, Graz'zt can twist it with his power.

Graz'zt's lair is a den of ostentation and hedonism. It is adorned with finery and decorations so decadent that even the wealthiest of mortals would blush at the excess. Within Graz'zt's lairs, devotees and subjects alike are forced to slake Graz'zt's thirst for pageantry.

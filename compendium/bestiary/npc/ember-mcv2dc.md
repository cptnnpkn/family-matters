> Glory to the Dragon Queen's name! Our designs on Abanasinia unfold according to your plans. This is no thanks to the so-called "adviser" I've been saddled with, the dragon Ember. The beast is terrifying, both in might and cunning, but it undermines my every design and terrorizes my forces. It's too canny to be caught, but I'm certain some portion of the troops we've lost to Qualinesti ambushes in fact smolder in the wyrm's gut. It thinks I don't hear, but it whispers curses in reply to my every command. Were it not one of our queen's favored children, I would have replaced my bed linens with its hide.

> I will complete our queen's work with the troops at my disposal, but when I return to Neraka, I would have this viper reassigned. I recommend to Icewall.

Also known as Pyros, Ember is an imperious and ruthless red dragon who serves the Dragon Queen Takhisis. In his service to the Dragon Queen, Ember has taken on many roles at her behest—including that of a black-robed human member of the Mages of High Sorcery—but he is best known as the adviser of Dragon Highlord Verminaard, leader of the Red Dragon Army.

Empowered by Takhisis herself, Ember's innate fire can sear those nearby, and his breath weapon is a molten storm of ash and flame. In combat, Ember wears a set of magic plate armor that bolsters his already-impressive might, allowing him to annihilate entire cohorts with terrifying ease.

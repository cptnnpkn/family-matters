- "desc": "The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material\
    \ Plane, and vice versa."
  "name": "Ethereal Sight"
- "desc": "The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were\
    \ difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside\
    \ an object."
  "name": "Incorporeal Movement"
- "desc": "If it is destroyed, the ghost re-forms after 24 hours. To truly destroy\
    \ the ghost, characters must lay Eigeron's spirit to rest by killing Blagothkus."
  "name": "Rejuvenation"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17\
    \ (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage."
  "name": "Withering Touch"
- "desc": "The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\
    \ It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and\
    \ vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane."
  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "One humanoid or giant that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then\
    \ disappears, and the target is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive\
    \ the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or\
    \ other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ and [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). It otherwise\
    \ uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's\
    \ knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the\
    \ body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost\
    \ is turned or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for\
    \ 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\
    \ If a creature possessed by the ghost is forcibly removed from the Eye of Annam,\
    \ the ghost is expelled from its host and re-forms in the middle of this room."

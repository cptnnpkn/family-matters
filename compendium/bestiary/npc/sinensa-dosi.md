Myconids are intelligent, mobile fungi that live in caves, seek enlightenment, and dislike violence. Adult myconids live and work together in colonies and practice a form of communal meditation called a meld, in which they seek to transcend mundane reality through shared hallucination.

Myconid leaders like Sinensa use their Hallucination Spores to help myconids create melds.

# [Mortlock Vanthampur](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/mortlock-vanthampur-bgdia.md)
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 26*  

Mortlock is tolerated by his mother, Duke Thalamra Vanthampur, and despised by his older brothers, Thurstwell and Amrik, who view him as a simpleton and an abomination. Half of Mortlock's face was scarred by fire when he was a child, and his disfigurement gives him a fearsome countenance.

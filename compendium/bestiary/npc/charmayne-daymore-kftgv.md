# [Charmayne Daymore](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/charmayne-daymore-kftgv.md)
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 159*  

A powerful spellcaster, Charmayne had become jealous of the king's passion and warmth. Longing to possess those qualities, she painstakingly created rituals to drain Jhaeros's vitality and charm, and to funnel these qualities into herself. However, the magic only enhanced her greed and jealousy; the more she took from Jhaeros, the hungrier for power Charmayne became, going so far as to murder her fellow councilor, Regine, while she slept.

As she came to realize the people of Ghalasine didn't love her as they did the king, Charmayne became filled with rage. She used magic to tear out Jhaeros's heart while keeping it alive. She then used the still-beating heart as the focus of a ritual to destroy Ghalasine.

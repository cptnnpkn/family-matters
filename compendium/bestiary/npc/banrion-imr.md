# [Banrion](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/banrion-imr.md)
*Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild p. 91*  

Unrelated to the horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering like starlight. They allow good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food, but they hold evil ever at bay.

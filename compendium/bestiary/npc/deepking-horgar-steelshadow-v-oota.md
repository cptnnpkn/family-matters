# [Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/deepking-horgar-steelshadow-v-oota.md)
*Source: Out of the Abyss p. 82*  

Deepking Horgar V ascended to the throne in 1372 DR. He is a ruthless and canny ruler who engages in secret meetings with all the city's councils and clans to keep their members guessing what he's up to, hands out favors out of the blue, and lets it be known that he'll use any trick to maintain his hold on power. This includes hiring assassins through third parties to take care of potential troublemakers. This strategy keeps all the city's factions at each other's throats and out of Horgar's way.

Like many other duergar in the city, Horgar Steelshadow V has been touched by the demon lords' madness. Roll on the [Indefinite Madness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/indefinite-madness.md) table in "chapter 8" of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to determine Horgar's flaw.

    \ they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of Grandfather\
    \ Oak. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until Grandfather\
    \ Oak dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until Grandfather Oak takes\
    \ a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root\

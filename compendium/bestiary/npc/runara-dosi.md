*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle p. 40*  

Despite her innocuous disguise and her commitment to peace, the leader of Dragon's Rest is an adult bronze dragonâ€”a fearsome opponent or a powerful ally. Her capabilities go beyond what is presented here.

Many bronze dragons are friendly coastal dwellers who enjoy watching ships and sailors.

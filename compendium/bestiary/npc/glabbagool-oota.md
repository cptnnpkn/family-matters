# [Glabbagool](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/glabbagool-oota.md)
*Source: Out of the Abyss p. 35*  

Juiblex's arrival in the Underdark has granted Glabbagool sentience and awareness. The ooze is genuinely curious about other creatures and wants to learn more about the world. It defends itself if attacked, but doesn't otherwise try to harm the characters, instead asking who they are, where they come from, and why they have come to the temple.

    \ creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.\n\nOn a successful save,\
    \ the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of Glabbagool.\
    \ A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed\
    \ saving throw.\n\nOn a failed save, Glabbagool enters the creature's space, and\
    \ the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature\
    \ can't breathe, is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained),\
    \ and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of Glabbagool's turns.\
    \ When Glabbagool moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.\n\nAn engulfed creature\
    \ can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success,\
    \ the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of Glabbagool."

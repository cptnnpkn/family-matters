# [Thessalar](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/thessalar-imr.md)
*Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild p. 57*  

Thessalar was a master alchemist and creator of monsters, whose own blood was said to possess dire magical properties.

He is vainglorious, egotistical, and utterly ruthless in furthering his research. His career began as a priest in the service of Moloch, where he rose through the ranks before eventually taking over the temple as a working laboratory. Most of his experiments have involved the pursuit of new forms of life, resulting in such creatures as the thessalhydra and the owlbear. In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of lifeâ€”namely his own. Thessalar hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.

Over time, Thessalar has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties. He regularly uses it as the basis for many of the reagents used throughout his labs.

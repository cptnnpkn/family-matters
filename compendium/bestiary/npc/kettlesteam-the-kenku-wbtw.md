# [Kettlesteam the Kenku](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/kettlesteam-the-kenku-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 52*  

Kettlesteam the kenku snoops around the carnival under the cover of a [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions "earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.

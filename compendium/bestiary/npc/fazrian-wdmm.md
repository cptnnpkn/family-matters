# [Fazrian](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/fazrian-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 275*  

Once an exemplar of courage and good judgment, Fazrian now seeks to destroy any creature it believes is undeserving of continued existence. Fazrian's views are a mockery of what they once were. Every creature is guilty of "deformity" in the planetar's eyes. Unless someone can swiftly prove their innocence, Fazrian sentences that individual to an immediate death.

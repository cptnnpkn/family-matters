# [Miros Xelbrin](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/miros-xelbrin-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 251*  

Innkeeper Miros is a retired carnival attraction, dubbed "the Yeti" because of his barrel-shaped body and the thick, white hair covering his arms, chest, back, and head. When Goldenfields suffers, so does his business, so he takes strides to protect the compound.

Ideal:"As does the Emerald Enclave, I believe that civilization and the wilderness need to learn to coexist."

Bond:"Make fun of me all you like, but don't speak ill of my inn or my employees!"

Flaw:"When something upsets me, I have a tendency to fly into a rage."

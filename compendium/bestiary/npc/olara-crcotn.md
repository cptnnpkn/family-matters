# [Olara](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/olara-crcotn.md)
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 129*  

Olara speaks an ancient dialect that formed the basis for both Elvish and Orc, and any character who speaks and understands either of those languages can converse with her. This is a trait she shares with some of the ghosts of her kinfolk that still haunt the ruins of Cael Morrow, but Olara is no ghost; she is one of the few mortals who survived Gruumsh's attack centuries ago. She subsists on the kelp growing throughout the Drowned City.

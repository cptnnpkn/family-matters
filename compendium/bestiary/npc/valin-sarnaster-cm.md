# [Valin Sarnaster](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/valin-sarnaster-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 182*  

Valin Sarnaster has been thoroughly corrupted by visions of a future in which she sees herself as the immortal heir of Savras's realm.*The Canopic Being*came into her possession years ago, and an obsession with the dark rituals therein set the oracle on her present course.

Valin has become a powerful undead as the first step on her path to godhood, and is now a mummy lord.

Valin can use her lair actions in any area of the tomb.

## Valin Sarnaster's Lair

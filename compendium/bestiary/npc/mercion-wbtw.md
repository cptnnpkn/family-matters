# [Mercion](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/mercion-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 224*  

Mercion strikes the balance of a natural leader and a protective caregiver. She has a direct manner that reassures and inspires those around her.

Mercion does not worship a deity, but rather an ideal: that truth gives life to artistry and beauty, and that those who embrace deceit should be censured and punished. Light is her domain.

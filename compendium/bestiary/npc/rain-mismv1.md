# [Rain](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/rain-mismv1.md)

> [!note]
> Created by Kenzie C.

Rain lives in happy meadows atop clouds, away from all the evil of the world. She loves cupcakes and readily accepts them as gifts. She has fiery wings and a tiny halo around the tip of her horn. When confronted by bullies or evildoers, she can emit rainbow-colored positive energy from her haloed horn. Rain uses her rainbows to heal friendly creatures and punish evildoers, transforming the latter into glittering flowers.

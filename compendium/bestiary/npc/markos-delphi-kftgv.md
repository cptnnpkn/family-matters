# [Markos Delphi](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/markos-delphi-kftgv.md)
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 53*  

Markos Delphi grew up with an insatiable curiosity. Eventually, he had his fill of worldly knowledge and began delving into the arcane, eager to understand the secrets of the planes of existence. Raised in a family of scholars and academics, Markos wished to make a breakthrough discovery that would propel himself and his family to new heights.

This quest for understanding became Markos's obsession. He sequestered himself and his fellow researchers in the remote Delphi Mansion. Markos used astrology-based magic to attempt to contact other planes, and something finally answered him: an entity that called itself Krokulmar. This entity made a pact with Markos, granting insight into the multiverse in exchange for influence on the Material Plane. Markos assumed Krokulmar's intentions were benign.

# [Mirt](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/mirt-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 211*  

Once known as Mirt the Merciless and the Old Wolf, Mirt made a fortune and carved out a reputation as an adventurer and philanderer. Today, an older and wiser Mirt serves as one of the Masked Lords, a Harper, and a close advisor to Laeral Silverhand. The years have not worn him down, and though he has grown soft in the flesh, he remains deceptively strong, vigorous, and clear of mind. Mirt has survived the passing of centuries by means of magic, and of all the Masked Lords, he is the least concerned with concealing his identity.

Despite his prodigious girth, Mirt can move with good speed when he must, and he hasn't let his adventuring skills wither. His wife, Asper, passed away several years ago, and his rambling mansion has seen better days. Mirt spends his days embroiled in politics and whiles away his nights in drink and debauchery.

## Treasure

Mirt has access to magic items of all kinds, but keeps only a few on his person. He can equip himself with other magic items as the need arises.

In addition to his other magical gear, Mirt owns a Lord's ensemble (see appendix A). He dons the ensemble only when meeting with other Masked Lords in an official capacity.

# [Soluun Xibrindas](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/soluun-xibrindas-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 202*  

Soluun is a sadistic, fanatical bully who is fiercely loyal to Bregan D'aerthe, and to Jarlaxle in particular. His younger brother, Nar'l, has infiltrated the Xanathar Guild. Soluun considers Nar'l a weakling who turned to arcane magic by way of compensation, and he has never had much faith in his brother or his abilities.

Soluun has a burning hatred of surface elves and halfelves, having been taught from a young age to kill them as opportunity permits. When not engaged in a Bregan D'aerthe operation, Soluun spends his nights haunting the darkened streets and alleys of Waterdeep, looking for solitary elves or half-elves to pick off. He conceals his nighttime escapades as well as he can, but Jarlaxle, Fel'rekt, and Krebbyg know what he's up to.

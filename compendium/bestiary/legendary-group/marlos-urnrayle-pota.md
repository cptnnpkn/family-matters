# Marlos Urnrayle

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Marlos is in the earth node while [Ogrémoch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) isn't, the medusa can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Marlos uses a lair action to cast [earthquake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md) without using components. As long as he maintains [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on [earthquake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md), initiative count 20 is the start of Marlos's turn for the purpose of the spell. He can take no other lair actions while concentrating on [earthquake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md).

Marlos's second option for a lair action is to draw power from the earth node to heal. When he does so, he regains 30 (`6d8 + 3`) hit points.

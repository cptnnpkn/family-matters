Rumors speak of a dark intelligence rooted within, seeking power and using their own bones, or even the wriggling worms that thrive within their corpses, as currency to trade with shadowy merchants.

## Skeletons

Skeletons are often the first creatures to be reanimated by aspiring necromancers, imbued with a vulgar imitation of life and reassembled into an approximation of their living forms. No trace remains of the life that once animated a skeleton, whose only purpose is loyalty.

Skeletons follow the orders of their creators until those orders are completed. Their obedient, tireless nature makes them perfect as disposable battle fodder, guards, or distractionsâ€”and, in great enough numbers, turns them into an overwhelming tide of bone, tooth, and blade.

### Undead Nature

A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Alignment

Neutral evil.

## Flaming Skeleton

The skeletal remains of many of those who opposed "Thordak the Cinder King" are said to be forever imbued with the primordial power of his fire breath. Areas scarred by the red dragon's power, including "Thordak's Crater" in "Emon's" "Cloudtop District", the "Ashen Gorge" in the "Stormcrest Mountains", and "Serpent's Head" in the "Cliffkeep Mountains", are rife with flaming skeletons. These undead react to the raw power of the Elemental Planes, and are filled with an unquenchable desire to spread flames far and wide until nothing is left untouched by fire.

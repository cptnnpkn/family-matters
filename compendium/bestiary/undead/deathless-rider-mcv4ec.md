# [Deathless Rider](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/deathless-rider-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Legends told in the courts of Eldraine suggest that the deathless riders serve a warlock-queen, known simply as the Shadow Queen, who rules from a castle called Dynnistan. It isn't known whether these legends are based on any true experience or are simply the result of imagination trying to account for a terrifying and unexplained phenomenon.

In either case, deathless riders are undeniably real. They are undead knights, once human, who ride undead steeds through the remotest parts of the wilds. They are sometimes called lich-knights or fell horsemen.

In stark contrast to the knights of Eldraine, the deathless riders are without virtue of any kind. They are few in numberâ€”unless many more lurk in the dark heart of the forest than anyone is aware. But when mortal knights meet them in the wilds, the encounter rarely ends well for the living. The deathless riders fight with superhuman strength, heedless of wounds and relentless in their assault.

A typical deathless rider's mount is a warhorse skeleton, though some lich-knights ride equine spirits like nightmares.

- "desc": "If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then\
    \ use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other\
    \ creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity\
    \ saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.\
    \ On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked\
    \ [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), and is pushed 5 feet out\
    \ of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If\
    \ no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ in the bulette's space."

# [Specter of Night](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/specter-of-night-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Like dark mirrors of Eldraine's archons (see " Archon of Boundaries "), specters appear as shrouded figures mounted on horrific flying beasts. It is easy to look at a specter and imagine the rider in command of the mount, but the truth is the opposite; the flying horror is an Undead monster that scours the wilds for a knightly corpse. On finding one, the horror binds its essence to the dead body, giving the corpse the semblance of life as a rider. The two function as a single creature, more powerful for their unnatural union.

Humans of Eldraine view specters as heralds of death. Specters are said to utter a keening wail, mournful beyond all other sounds and audible only to those who are about to die.

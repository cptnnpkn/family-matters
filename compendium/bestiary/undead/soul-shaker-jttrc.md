# [Soul Shaker](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/soul-shaker-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 47*  

A grasping mass of Humanoid limbs, a soul shaker is an obsessive claimer of corpses and collector of body parts. These nightmarish creatures arise from ghoulish collections of severed limbs exposed to necromantic energies or when numerous crawling claws form a cooperative relationship.

Most of a soul shaker's victims have their vitality drained and their flesh pulverized by its many arms. However, should a soul shaker encounter someone with an impressionable mind, the creature attempts to charm the individual, using them as a lure to tempt others into its hunting grounds.

If defeated, a soul shaker disperses into several skittering, animate limbs. The terror can only truly be vanquished by destroying these disembodied appendages. If more than one of these pieces escape, the soul shaker reforms over the course of days and begins hunting once more.

# [Lichen Lich](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/lichen-lich-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 223*  

Lichen liches are undead remnants of powerful druids.

A lichen lich looks like a skeleton covered with fungi and bark-like lichen. A lichen lich has vines within its chest cavity. These vines exude viscid and poisonous black fluid.

    \ wind.  \n- The lich commands the might of its diseased grove, creating a shambling\
    \ mound. The shambling mound appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of\
    \ the lich, acts on its own initiative count, and obeys the lich's commands. The\
    \ shambling mound dies after 1 hour or when the lich uses this lair action again.\
    \  \n- Rotten roots and vines magically erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on\
    \ a point on the ground that the lich can see within 120 feet of it. The lich\
    \ is unaffected by the roots and vines. For all other creatures, the area becomes\
    \ difficult terrain, and each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength\
    \ saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by the roots. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another creature\
    \ within its reach, doing so with a successful DC 19 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
    \ check. The roots and vines wilt away when the lich uses this lair action again\
    \ or when the lich dies.  "

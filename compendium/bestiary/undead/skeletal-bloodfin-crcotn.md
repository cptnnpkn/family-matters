# [Skeletal Bloodfin](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/skeletal-bloodfin-crcotn.md)
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 159*  

Covered in vicious-looking crimson spines and sleek scales, the slithering bloodfin flashes through the lightless waters of the Netherdeep. As it swims closer, its toothed maw comes into viewâ€”just before it unhinges its jaw, clamps down on its prey, and swallows it whole.

A slithering bloodfin looks like a giant eel with a head like a shark's. It magically siphons life energy from swallowed prey and uses that energy to repair damage to its own body.

When a bloodfin dies, its body bursts. The resulting gore is toxic, threatening to infect nearby creatures, until it is dissipated by currents.

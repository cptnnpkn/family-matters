# [Girallon Zombie](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/girallon-zombie-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 240*  

Several new zombie variants are presented below. For more information on zombies, see the Monster Manual.

## Ankylosaurus Zombie

This creature is slow and barely aware of its surroundings.

## Girallon Zombie

Girallons are four-armed apes with white fur. Girallon zombies are slower than their non-undead counterparts but no less fierce. The necromantic energy empowering them fuels their murderous hearts and their hunger for living flesh.

## Tyrannosaurus Zombie

A tyrannosaurus zombie has a gullet full of smaller zombies, which it can disgorge. These zombies aren't under the tyrannosaurus zombie's control.

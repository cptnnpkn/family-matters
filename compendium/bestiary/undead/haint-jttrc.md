# [Haint](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/haint-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 185*  

Rising from the sorrowful dead, haints are spirits that change their shape in tragic imitation of what they once were. A haint can shift from its spectral form to appear as the corporeal Humanoid it was in life, passing as a living creature. These spirits might mistakenly view innocents as those who killed them or entreat mortals to exact revenge on their behalf.

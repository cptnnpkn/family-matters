## Rivermaw Warriors

The "Rivermaw herd" is a nomadic society mostly composed of "half-giants", also known as "goliaths", and a mighty force for good on the "Dividing Plains". The herd was once conquered by a goliath tyrant named Kevdak, then formed anew after Kevdak was eventually defeated by Vox Machina. Free of Kevdak's martial cruelty, the Rivermaw see it as their duty to prevent any such tyrant from conquering the "Dividing Plains" ever again.

Though most members of the "Rivermaw herd" are "goliaths", their ranks include people of all races who wish to live beyond the stone walls of "Westruun" and the palisades of plains towns like "Turst Fields". "Orcs", "humans", "halflings", and "gnolls" make up most of the rest of the herd's warriors. Most of those warriors value strength and endurance over other qualities, but the brawlers and stormborn of the Rivermaw are better known for cunning, intelligence, strategy, and a unique attunement to the mighty thunder of the Stormlord.

## Rivermaw Brawler

Many children in the "Rivermaw herd" get into friendly brawls, but only the truly dedicated learn the art of fist fighting. Rivermaw brawlers usually lead the charge on the battlefield, using their exceptional strength, speed, and cunning to throw an enemy vanguard into chaos.

Beyond the "Dividing Plains", brawlers trained by the Rivermaw can be found in noble adventuring parties, working for the "Clasp" as muscle, in underground fighting rings, and as personal bodyguards. In "Emon", the most famous fist fighters make a name for themselves within the "Brawler's League" or the "Godsbrawl", representing the Stormlord in that annual holy tournament.

Members of the "Clasp"—a stealthy organization of spies, thieves, assassins, and smugglers—are at once beloved folk heroes worthy of bardsong and bedtime stories, and sinister scoundrels whose deeds are the stuff of infamous legend. While definitely in the business of discreetly performing illegal deeds for the wealthy, "Clasp" operatives are also known as the roguish heroes who saved countless common folk of Tal'Dorei during the "Cinder King's" tyranny. They style their brand now as the "clasp" that holds society together—understanding that, after all, an organized criminal syndicate requires a functioning, civilized economy.

## Clasp Cutthroat

When the thieves and assassins of the "Clasp" need to acquire additional funds or relieve certain people of their possessions, the organization's cutthroats are the first to be called. However, the "Clasp" didn't earn an extraordinary customer satisfaction rating by letting just any scoundrel claim the rank of cutthroat. An effective cutthroat is patient and precise. Sneak in, take cover, wait, strike only with advantage, and fight without honor. If spotted, misdirect by fleeing—then regain a strategic position, and attack when they least expect it.

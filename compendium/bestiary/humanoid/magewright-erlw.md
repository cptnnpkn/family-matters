# [Magewright](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/magewright-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 318*  

In Khorvaire, magic is part of everyday life. A chef might use [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md) to heat and season food, while a blacksmith uses [mending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mending.md) to perform minor repairs and [guidance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md) to help inspire their work. Those who work minor magic into their labors are called magewrights.

Far more limited in magical power than a typical spellcaster, a magewright is dedicated to learning a handful of spells, and magewrights cast their non-cantrip spells as rituals—even spells that can't normally be cast in this way. Most magewright rituals take 10 minutes to perform, but certain complex rituals can take up to 1 hour. However long the ritual takes, it requires extra material components, usually in the form of dragonshards.

## Creating a Magewright

The magewright stat block provides the baseline statistics for a magewright. You then add to that baseline by choosing a specialty from the Magewright Specialties table, or roll for one. The specialty determines additional spells the magewright knows, including ones that can be cast only as rituals. The specialty also gives the magewright more proficiencies.

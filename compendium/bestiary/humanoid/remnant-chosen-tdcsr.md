# [Remnant Chosen](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/remnant-chosen-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 251*  

## Remnants

The "Remnants" is a foul cult dedicated to seeing their lich leader, The Whispered One, ascend to godhood. Cultists believe that self-mutilation and transitory failings are requirements to pierce the veil and see the world for the lie it is—including accepting that the true hidden world already belongs to The Whispered One.

### Bitter Victory

The "Remnants" have both won and failed in their dire goal, as The Whispered One ascended but was banished beyond the Divine Gate. Yet they name him the Ascendant One, the Banished One, or—because all others gods are pretenders—simply the One, and prepare patiently for his final ascension.

## Remnant Chosen

All devotees of The Whispered One are zealous followers, spending hours in silent meditation hoping to hear their long-dead master whisper a commandment from beyond. However, only a rare few hear the spectral voice of The Whispered One as it worms its way into their minds, emptying out other thought and filling their heads with clarity and direction. Much of this direction involves the "Remnants'" plans to leverage secrets stolen from the Plane of Shadow to increase the cult's power in Tal'Dorei.

# [Troglodyte Champion of Laogzed](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/troglodyte-champion-of-laogzed-oota.md)
*Source: Out of the Abyss p. 229*  

The Monster Manual provides statistics for the typical troglodyte. Once in a while, a troglodyte tribe produces an unusually smart and strong specimen that can spew acid-what many troglodytes consider blessings from Laogzed, their demonic god. These hulking troglodyte champions make excellent chieftains.

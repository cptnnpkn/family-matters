# [Oriq Blood Mage](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/oriq-blood-mage-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 201*  

Oriq blood mages create deadly weapons formed of their own blood. They can also sense the life energy within nearby creatures, making the blood mages almost impossible to ambush.

## Oriq

The Oriq are a secret society of mages who wield forbidden magic in the service of their leader, Extus Narr. Narr was in consideration for elevation to the role of Oracle of Strixhaven, but when the Founder Dragons passed him over in favor of Jadzi, his bitterness knew no bounds. He now uses the Oriq to gather the spells and magical energy he needs to summon a devastating being, the Blood Avatar, to destroy Strixhaven.

The Oriq work in secret, infiltrating Strixhaven to search for the magic their master covets and watch for impressionable students and embittered faculty they might turn to their cause. The Oriq take pains to hide their true allegiance and wear masks to hide their identities. These masks have magical properties that function only for their intended wearers.

## Vox Machina

Heroes. Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, "Wildemount", "Issylra", and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of "Stilben" to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.

The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.

Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the "Tal'Dorei Council", shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.

Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the [Vestiges of Divergence](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/vestiges-of-divergence-by-advancement-tdcsr.md), whose power they unlocked in the battles against the "Cinder King" and The Whispered One, are still within their grasp.

The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a "quest giver," for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.

## Vex'ahlia de Rolo

Vex'ahlia was one of the first members of Vox Machina when those adventurers initially met in "Stilben", along with her twin brother, [Vax'ildan](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md). Today, she is one of the most influential people in Tal'Dorei. She sits on the "Tal'Dorei Council" as Master of Commerce and is "Whitestone's" "Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt", a champion of the Dawnfather, and a hero beloved by all who know the legend of Vox Machina. Her charm and skill with a bow are legendary, and she is equally dedicated to changing the world as she is to raising her five children in "Whitestone".

### Charming and Incorrigible

As an adventurer, Vex'ahlia was known for being resolute and confident even in the face of unspeakable despair. The stories told of Vex revolve around her cunning, her flirtatious charm, and her propensity for haggling—an expression of her impoverished childhood in the wildlands of Tal'Dorei. The hardships she has endured and overcome have not changed her for the worse, though. She is the same Vex'ahlia that is remembered in the legends, just with a few more gray hairs and somehow even more responsibilities. Even her beloved animal companion, the brown bear [Trinket](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/trinket-tdcsr.md), is still by her side—though age has slowed him somewhat. His young cub is now a well-behaved playmate for the youngest de Rolo children.

### After the Epilogue

Though she's better known for her archery skill, Vex'ahlia's capability with coin made her an easy choice for election to the "Tal'Dorei Council" as Master of Commerce. She makes frequent use of a teleportation circle to travel between "Castle Whitestone" and "Traverse Junction" in "Emon", making it possible to fulfill her duties to both the "Chamber of Whitestone" and the "Tal'Dorei Council". Though she has generally left her adventuring life behind her, she does occasionally sortie with the "Grey Hunters" to eliminate threats to the continued peace and prosperity of Tal'Dorei.

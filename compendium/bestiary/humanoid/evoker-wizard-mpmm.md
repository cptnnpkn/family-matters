Evokers harness arcane energy to destroy. Many armies employ evokers to rain destruction down on enemy forces.

## Wizards

Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.

    \ it can see in the area to ignore the spell, as the evoker sculpts the spell's\
    \ energy around them. On a failed save, a creature takes 40 (9d8) damage of\
    \ the chosen type and is knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).\

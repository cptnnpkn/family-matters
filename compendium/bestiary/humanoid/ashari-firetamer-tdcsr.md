## Ashari

A reclusive society of elementalist druidic masters, "the Ashari" symbolize the connection between civilization and nature in balance as they govern, heal, and tame Exandria's primordial threats.

### Mysterious Beginnings

No one knows "the Ashari's" true origins, though one popular legend ties directly to the ancient war between the gods and the primordial titans. As the "Prime Deities" scattered the essence of their fallen foes across Exandria, the titans' remains birthed new Elemental Planes. In response, numerous humanoids—who would eventually become part of "the Ashari"—were gifted with a magical affinity to shape the world and a responsibility to defend against future primordial threats.

### Triumph Divided

A multiracial people, "the Ashari" strategically organize into four distinct communities—the Fire Ashari of Pyrah, the Air Ashari of "Zephrah", the Earth Ashari of "Terrah", and the Water Ashari of Vesrah. Each community builds homes alongside sources of elemental power.

### Primordial Guardians

The walls between the Material Plane and the Elemental Planes are thin, and if those boundaries are tested, they tear asunder and form rifts. These planar fractures hemorrhage vast fields of wildfire, avalanches of crushing stone, boundless expanses of screeching hurricanes, and unending oceans of pounding tsunamis, all seemingly yearning for destruction.

When an elemental rift grows volatile, "the Ashari" become a living dam—subduing, soothing, and sealing its escaping power. Then, once a rift calms, "the Ashari's" work to heal the surrounding land begins.

### Selfless Respect

Ashari is a word found in many languages with a multitude of meanings, including: sunrise, innate will, torchbearer, and gardener. Some Ashari greetings include, "The Wildmother sees you" and "Your actions bring forth light."

## Ashari Firetamer

Of all "the Ashari" tribes, the Fire Ashari of Pyrah have suffered the greatest. Their people were all but destroyed when "Thordak" burst through the Rift of Flame in his cataclysmic return to Exandria. Yet despite their immense hardships, the Fire Ashari have given selflessly to the people of Tal'Dorei.

Firetamers are the elite elementalists of the Pyrah, using their attunement to the primordial forces of the world to not just create fire, not just command it, but tame it to their will. A firetamer of Pyrah is nothing like the manic pyromancers of Tal'Dorei. For while the latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire's destructive power—or wield that same power to destroy those who threaten their people.

Firetamers are almost always accompanied by a [salamander](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md), a [fire elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md), or a small herd of [magma](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magma-mephit.md) or [smoke mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/smoke-mephit.md). While home in Pyrah, Ashari firetamers use their power to control the Rift of Flame or to control the flames of the volcanic forest known as the Cindergrove. And on the outskirts of "Emon", a group of firetamers led by a half-orc Ashari named Lorkathar keeps watch over the volatile "Scar of the Cinder King".

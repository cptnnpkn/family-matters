## Remnants

The "Remnants" is a foul cult dedicated to seeing their lich leader, The Whispered One, ascend to godhood. Cultists believe that self-mutilation and transitory failings are requirements to pierce the veil and see the world for the lie it is—including accepting that the true hidden world already belongs to The Whispered One.

### Bitter Victory

The "Remnants" have both won and failed in their dire goal, as The Whispered One ascended but was banished beyond the Divine Gate. Yet they name him the Ascendant One, the Banished One, or—because all others gods are pretenders—simply the One, and prepare patiently for his final ascension.

## Remnant Cultist

All cultists of The Whispered One endure horrific rites of initiation that force them to remove one of their own eyes and forever shackle themselves to the will of the cult's leaders. Every cultist can feel the presence of their foul god just beyond the fabric of the physical world, and many claim to hear him speaking to them when all else is silent.

The cultists of The Whispered One still venerate their wrathful master with offerings of secrets and unwilling souls to gain his favor, learning what they can and keeping hidden that which they know. Cultists believe in cultivating evil in themselves and recognizing it in others, encouraging them to express it. They hope to seed the ruin of all who worship other deities until only those who kneel before The Whispered One remain.

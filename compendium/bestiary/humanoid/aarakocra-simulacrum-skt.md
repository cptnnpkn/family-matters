- "desc": "When a simulacrum drops to 0 hit points or is subjected to a successful\

- "desc": "Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically summon an air\
    \ elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive\
    \ turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\
    \ while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished\
    \ their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands.\
    \ It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its\
    \ summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance\
    \ again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental\
    \ Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it."

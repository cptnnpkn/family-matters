# [Yeti Tyke](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/yeti-tyke-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 313*  

Yeti tykes are as volatile and mean as their parents, their fearsomeness diminished only by their size. Standing 3 feet tall on average, they like to bully creatures of their height or smaller. But they are easily intimidated by bigger and stronger creatures. A cowed yeti tyke can be controlled, at least for a while, but raising one to be anything other than a savage, flesh-eating predator is incredibly difficult (though not impossible).

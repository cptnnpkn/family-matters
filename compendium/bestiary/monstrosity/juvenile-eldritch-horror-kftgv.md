- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller\
    \ creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing\
    \ damage. The target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled)\

    \ and the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\

  "name": "Constrict"
- "desc": "The eldritch horror exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and\
    \ 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw,\
    \ taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage\
    \ on a successful one."
  "name": "Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)"
- "desc": "The eldritch horror makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target\
    \ it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple\
    \ ends. While swallowed, the target is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\
    \ and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects outside the eldritch horror, and it\
    \ takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the eldritch horror's turns.\
    \ A eldritch horror can have only one creature swallowed at a time.\n\nIf the\
    \ eldritch horror takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed\
    \ creature, the eldritch horror must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw\
    \ at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ in a space within 10 feet of the eldritch horror. If the eldritch horror dies,\
    \ a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."

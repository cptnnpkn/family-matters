- "desc": "The medusa's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13).\
    \ The medusa can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\
    \nCantrips (at will): [light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/light.md)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30\
    \ feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving\
    \ throw if the medusa isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature\
    \ is instantly [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified). Otherwise,\
    \ a creature that fails the save begins to turn to metal, wood, or porcelain (the\
    \ medusa's choice) and is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\
    \ The [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature must\
    \ repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until\
    \ the creature is freed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to\
    \ avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it\
    \ can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its\
    \ eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately\
    \ make the save.\n\nIf the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface\
    \ within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its\
    \ curse, affected by its own gaze."

# [Zorbo](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/zorbo-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 241*  

A zorbo (pronounced ZOR-boh) is a ferocious omnivore similar in size and appearance to a koala. Living in trees and caves, it has long claws, a dour disposition, and a fondness for humanoid flesh. A zorbo alters its natural armor to match its surroundings, and it can weaken and destroy armor, shields, and protective magic items with its sharp claws.

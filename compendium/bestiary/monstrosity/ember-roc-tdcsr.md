# [Ember Roc](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/ember-roc-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 238*  

Centuries old, birthed by primordial chaos, and equaling the oldest dragons in size, the ember roc is an engine of ruthless consumption. With wingspans vast enough to blot out the sky and auras bright enough to rival the sun, these fiery birds of prey hunt only the deadliest game.

## Evolutionary Fire

The Fire Ashari of Pyrah believe that the mythic [rocs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md) that gave rise to the ember rocs maintain balance in Tal'Dorei. [Rocs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md) avoid humanoid settlements and hunt the monstrous creatures that would otherwise threaten those settlements. So "the Ashari" lure [rocs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md) to sites of elemental rifts, enticing them to devour creatures attempting to escape into the Material Plane. After years of feeding on [fire elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md), [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md), [fire giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md), and more, a [roc](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md) is imbued with primordial power, flames erupting from every feather to transform it into the ember roc.

## Hopeless Ends

An ember roc patiently observes prey for hours before it strikes, snatching up [elephants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/elephant.md), [whales](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/killer-whale.md), and even young dragons. It unleashes iron talons to [grapple](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) targets, paying no heed to counter-attacks, then soars back to its nestâ€”often inside an active volcano. If prey proves too much trouble while in flight, an ember roc readily drops it from some great height. But those unable to escape slowly roast in the creature's fiery grip.

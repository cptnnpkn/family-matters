  "name": "False Appearance"
- "desc": "The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked\
    \ (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a\
    \ tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril\
    \ on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action\
    \ and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it."

    \ The target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape\
    \ DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the\
    \ roper can't use the same tendril on another target."

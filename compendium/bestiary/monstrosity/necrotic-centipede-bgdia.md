    \ (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target\
    \ is a creature, it is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled)\

  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "The centipede makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature\
    \ it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and\
    \ is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\
    \ and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects outside the centipede, and it takes\
    \ 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the centipede's turns.\n\nIf\
    \ the centipede takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside\
    \ it, the centipede must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end\
    \ of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ in a space within 10 feet of the centipede. If the centipede dies, a swallowed\
    \ creature is no longer [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."

# [Nightmare Beast](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/nightmare-beast-mcv1sc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 1: Spelljammer Creatures p. 10*  

Nightmare beasts are enormous quadrupeds that stand 20 feet tall, or 40 feet tall when rearing on their hind legs.

A nightmare beast's legs end in claws, enabling it to climb well despite its size. Its skin is thick and tough, and its teeth are long and sharp. A pair of long, curved tusks jut from the sides of the beast's mouth, and its large red eyes glow in the dark. The creature smashes through structures and fortifications with ease, and it doesn't hesitate to rend foes with its claws and gore them with its tusks, but its most devastating attack is its magical ability to disintegrate foes with its terrible gaze.

Powerful spellcasters create nightmare beasts to serve as living siege engines. A single beast can lay waste to entire cities and armies.

# [Redtooth Werefox](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/redtooth-werefox-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

By day, the elves of Redtooth Keep are agile and adept rangers, expertly patrolling the lands around one of the last elven citadels in Eldraine. But at night, terrifying howls echo from the keep's halls as its inhabitants transform into ruthless werefoxes.

Unlike other forms of lycanthropy, the werefox curse isn't contagious and is limited to the elves of Redtooth Keep. Legends say that long ago, the garrison at Redtooth Keep turned away a group of travelers seeking shelter. Before departing, one of the travelers was revealed to be a powerful witch and cursed the elves, declaring that their bodies would forever transform to match their hearts' selfish and bestial natures.

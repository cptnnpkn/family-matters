# [Aurumvorax Den Leader](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/aurumvorax-den-leader-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 105*  

Aurumvoraxes that feed on a steady supply of precious metals gradually grow in size. These aurumvoraxes are faster and deadlier than others of their kind.

## Aurumvorax

An aurumvorax is an eight-legged, badger-like hunter. These aggressive omnivores attack any prey they think they can best, ambushing even creatures double their size. They supplement their diets with metal, whether it's worked or ore, and they have a particular taste for gold. This diet lends aurumvorax fur its golden sheen.

Alone or in small groups, aurumvoraxes dig deep in search of precious metals. Such exploration often leads them into conflict with subterranean settlements. As defenders of such communities often wear metal armor, aurumvoraxes prioritize attacking armored foesâ€”whether that armor is metal or not.

# [Aurak Draconian](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/aurak-draconian-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 196*  

Created from the eggs of gold dragons, aurak draconians are the most powerful of draconians, their entire being thrumming with eldritch power. Unlike other draconians, auraks are wingless. This might lull foes into a false sense of security, until the auraks exhale noxious fumes resembling those of their dragon progenitors. Auraks are masterminds and strategists that serve as commanders in the Dragon Armies. They often lead contingents of less powerful draconians. When slain, aurak draconians unleash their inherent magic in a deadly burst of lightning.

## Draconians

Draconians are bipedal monsters born from metallic dragon eggs that have been corrupted by a combination of warped alchemy and the Dragon Queen's foul magic. The Dragon Armies closely guard the secret of the draconians' creation, allowing Krynn's metallic dragons to continue to think their eggs are being held hostage so they don't oppose the Dragon Queen's conquests.

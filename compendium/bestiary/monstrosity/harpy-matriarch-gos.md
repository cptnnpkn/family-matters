# [Harpy Matriarch](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/harpy-matriarch-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 237*  

Happy to watch its flock squabble over carrion in Tammeraut's Fate, this gray-feathered matron of the harpies is surrounded by a cloud of magical spirits resembling skeletal seabirds.

- "desc": "The matriarch sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300\
    \ feet of the matriarch that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom\
    \ saving throw or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) until\
    \ the song ends. The matriarch must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns\
    \ to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the matriarch\
    \ is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).\n\n\
    While [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the matriarch,\
    \ a target is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ target is more than 5 feet away from the matriarch, the target must move on\
    \ its turn toward the matriarch by the most direct route, trying to get within\
    \ 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging\
    \ terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other\
    \ than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If\
    \ the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\n\nA target that successfully\
    \ saves is immune to this matriarch's song for the next 24 hours."

- "desc": "The matriarch projects a vision into the minds of creatures within 30 feet\
    \ of it that aren't constructs or undead, showing each creature achieving whatever\
    \ it most desires. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed)\
    \ until the end of its next turn."

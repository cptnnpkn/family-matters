# [Thessalkraken](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/thessalkraken-imr.md)
*Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild p. 87*  

The alchemist Thessalar created unknown numbers of misshapen magical creatures, including his many thessalbeasts. Among the largest was the thessalkrakenâ€”a slightly smaller variant of the legendary kraken, resembling that great tentacled titan but with a jagged-toothed maw that drips constantly with acid.

A thessalkraken lives in the dark depths, usually a sunken rift or a cavern filled with detritus, treasure, and the remains of sacrificial victims.

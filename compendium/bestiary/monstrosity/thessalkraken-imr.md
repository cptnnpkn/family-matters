# [Thessalkraken](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/thessalkraken-imr.md)
*Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild p. 87*  

The alchemist Thessalar created unknown numbers of misshapen magical creatures, including his many thessalbeasts. Among the largest was the thessalkraken—a slightly smaller variant of the legendary kraken, resembling that great tentacled titan but with a jagged-toothed maw that drips constantly with acid.

A thessalkraken lives in the dark depths, usually a sunken rift or a cavern filled with detritus, treasure, and the remains of sacrificial victims.

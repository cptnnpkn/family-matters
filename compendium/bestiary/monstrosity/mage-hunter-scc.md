# [Mage Hunter](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/mage-hunter-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 199*  

Mage hunters are hideous spider-legged creatures employed by the Oriq to pursue magic-wielders. These creatures can naturally sense magic via the glowing purple spines on their backs.

A mage hunter is usually in its sentry form, a diamond-shaped drone with a heightened ability to sense and locate mages. Once it finds a quarry, the mage hunter takes on its arachnoid hunter form and pursues its targets with vicious skill.

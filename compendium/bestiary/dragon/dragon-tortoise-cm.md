# [Dragon Tortoise](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\dragon/dragon-tortoise-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 205*  

Ogruhl has been trapped here for millennia, restrained by magic chains. Ogruhl was the prisoner of a cruel Netherese wizard. When the city around the tortoise was abandoned, Ogruhl was left to die. A band of chwingas found the tortoise and brought it food and water little by little to keep it alive. Over time, the chwingas and Ogruhl developed a symbiotic relationshipâ€”it defended them and provided a home for them, and they helped it to survive.

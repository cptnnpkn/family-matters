# [Bakunawa](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\dragon/bakunawa-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 147*  

Worshiped as draconic avatars of storm and tide, bakunawa soar over the archipelagos they call home. Iridescent scales crackling with lightning cover a bakunawa's fearsome serpentine body, and the sharp movements of its mighty wings echo with thunderous winds. Known for their mercilessness in battle, bakunawa swallow whole any who challenge them.

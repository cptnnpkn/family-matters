# [Witchkite](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\dragon/witchkite-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

While many dragons of Eldraine hoard wealth and material goods, witchkites prefer hoarding forbidden and dangerous magical secrets. The arcane nature of a witchkite's hoard seeps into the dragon's core, granting it spellcasting abilities and twisting its fiery breath into malevolent motes of magical flame.

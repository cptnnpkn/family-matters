# [Goblin Psi Brawler](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/goblin-psi-brawler-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 215*  

Goblin psi brawlers use their psionic talents to heighten their physical might. Their strikes crackle with psychic energy, and while angered, goblin psi brawlers can unleash a telekinetic thrust strong enough to knock enemies to the ground.

## Psionic Goblins

The specifics of how a psionic goblin comes to exist vary. Some are born, changed by energy leaking from the Far Realm. Others transform themselves with their psionic power or enter into agreements with other Aberrations, which help them transform in return for their service as shock troops. Regardless, the result is the same: a goblin with unnatural and barely contained psychic power.

Psionic goblins often struggle to handle the turbulent psychic energy within their minds and bodies. Those psionic goblins who learn how to safely tap into this psychic power are formidable forces in combat. Psionic goblins often augment their martial skills with telekinesis, and stealthy squads of psionic goblin warriors can communicate via telepathy, making them excellent infiltrators and ambushers.

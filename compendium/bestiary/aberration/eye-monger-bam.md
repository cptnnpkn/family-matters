- "desc": "Magical effects, including those produced by spells and magic items but\
    \ excluding those created by artifacts or deities, are suppressed inside the eye\
    \ monger's gullet. Any spell slot or charge expended by a creature in the gullet\
    \ to cast a spell or activate a property of a magic item is wasted. While an effect\
    \ is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts\
    \ against its duration. No spell or magical effect that originates outside the\
    \ eye monger's gullet, except one created by an artifact or a deity, can affect\
    \ a creature or an object inside the gullet."
  "name": "Antimagic Gullet"
- "desc": "If the eye monger is motionless and has its eye and mouth closed at the\
    \ start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature\
    \ hasn't observed the eye monger move or act, that creature must succeed on a\
    \ DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check to discern that the eye monger is animate."

"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12\
    \ (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature,\
    \ it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the eye\
    \ monger and deposited in the eye monger's gullet (see Antimagic Gullet). The\
    \ eye monger can swallow one creature at a time. A swallowed creature is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\
    \ and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), has total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects originating outside the eye monger,\
    \ and takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.\n\nIf the\
    \ eye monger takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside its\
    \ gullet, the eye monger regurgitates the swallowed creature, which falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ in a space within 10 feet of the eye monger. If the eye monger dies, a swallowed\
    \ creature is no longer [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."

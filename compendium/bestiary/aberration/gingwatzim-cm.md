# [Gingwatzim](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/gingwatzim-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 27*  

A gingwatzim is a peculiar form of life created by a spell or a ritual. The magic that brings it into being draws on spirit energy from the Ethereal Plane to give the gingwatzim its true form—that of a luminous (but not too bright) sphere of ectoplasm roughly 3 feet in diameter. A newly formed gingwatzim appears as near to its creator as possible and follows its creator's commands without question, using telepathy to communicate.

A gingwatzim can assume two other forms that are determined by its creator at the time the gingwatzim comes into being. One is an exact duplicate of a Tiny nonmagical object that its creator is wearing or carrying. The gingwatzim's other form is that of a specific Tiny beast.

    \ saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).\

    \ this attack."
  "name": "Energy Drain (True Form Only)"
- "desc": "The gingwatzim changes from its true form—a 3-foot-diameter sphere of luminous\
    \ ectoplasm—into one of its two alternate forms, or from one of those forms back\
    \ into its true form. In object form, it can't move or make attacks but otherwise\
    \ retains its statistics, and it is indistinguishable from the thing it is imitating.\
    \ In beast form, it retains its hit points but otherwise uses the stat block of\
    \ the beast it is imitating. When it dies, the gingwatzim reverts to its true\
    \ form and then vanishes."

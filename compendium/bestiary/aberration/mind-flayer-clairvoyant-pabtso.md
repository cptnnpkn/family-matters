# [Mind Flayer Clairvoyant](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/mind-flayer-clairvoyant-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 209*  

In pursuit of reconstructing their lost empire, a few mind flayers have turned to their home plane, the Far Realm, for answers. A mind flayer clairvoyant has peered into that realm's starless depths and been subsequently rewarded with extraordinary powers.

Instead of heeding an elder brain, a mind flayer clairvoyant listens to the whispers and whims of the voices of the Far Realm. In addition to feasting on brains, a mind flayer clairvoyant can summon tentacles that rip through the fabric of reality and distort the minds of enemies.

## Mind Flayers

Mind flayers, also known as illithids, feast on the brains of Humanoids across the multiverse. They are distinguished by their purple-toned skin and octopus-like heads, from which extend writhing tentacles.

# [Swarm of Sorrowfish](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/swarm-of-sorrowfish-crcotn.md)
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 210*  

A swarm of sorrowfish attacks out of hunger. Although sorrowfish have no sense of fear, they often adopt the tactic of lurking among the petrifying tendrils of a death embrace, using the tendrils for protection against other predators.

## Sorrowfish

Sorrowfish dwell in deep underwater trenches and thus are rarely encountered by surface-dwelling creatures. Some say sorrowfish get their name from their flavor, which is distasteful enough to put the creatures that eat them in a dismal mood. The true sorrow for other creatures comes when the sorrowfish gather in swarms. The malevolent presences that lurk in the abysses of the ocean exert their influence on these fish, transforming their swarms into vicious hordes.

# [Mind Flayer Prophet](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/mind-flayer-prophet-pabtso.md)
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 210*  

Some mind flayers dedicate their lives to channeling abstruse truths from beyond reality. This insight gives them preternatural senses and allows them to focus their innate psionic power.

## Mind Flayers

Mind flayers, also known as illithids, feast on the brains of Humanoids across the multiverse. They are distinguished by their purple-toned skin and octopus-like heads, from which extend writhing tentacles.

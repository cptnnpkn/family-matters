## Salvage

An avarice seraph's metal-tipped feathers can be sold. Those of the lesser seraph are worth 250 gp, while those of the seraph are worth 1,000 gp.

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist's supplies can melt the metal on the feathers of an avarice seraph and use some feathers as fletching to make one arrow of celestial slaying for a lesser seraph, or four such arrows from the seraph. Making one arrow takes 7 days of work, reagents worth 1,000 gp, and a successful DC 17 Intelligence or Wisdom check.

The saliva of a gluttony seraph functions as antitoxinâ€”three doses can be collected from a lesser seraph, while ten can be gathered from a seraph. Someone who has proficiency with alchemist's supplies or an herbalism kit can mix two doses of this saliva with reagents worth 50 gp and brew the mixture for 4 hours. The resulting elixir affects the imbiber as a protection from poison spell, curing a random poison in the drinker's system.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([History](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)).** The disavowed are seraphs fallen to evil. Each still retains a measure of its celestial power.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** From their celestial heritage, disavowed retain magic resistance and resistance to nonmagical attacks, as well as immunity to being charmed, exhausted, and frightened. Even in a fallen state, the seraph imparts magic and radiant damage to its attacks. Gluttony seraphs are also immune to poison.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Avarice seraphs can rouse the greed in any creature. Huge gluttony seraphs can swallow and digest people, although their lesser kin can't.

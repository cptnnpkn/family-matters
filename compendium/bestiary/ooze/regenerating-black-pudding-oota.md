- "desc": "The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing."
  "name": "Amorphous"
- "desc": "A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while\
    \ within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made\
    \ of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon\
    \ takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty\
    \ drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or\
    \ wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can\
    \ eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round."
  "name": "Corrosive Form"
- "desc": "The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings,\
    \ without needing to make an ability check."
  "name": "Spider Climb"
- "desc": "The pudding regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the pudding\
    \ takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the pudding's\
    \ next turn. The pudding dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and\
    \ doesn't regenerate."
  "name": "Regeneration"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6\
    \ + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage. In addition, nonmagical\
    \ armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative\
    \ −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces\
    \ its AC to 10."
  "name": "Pseudopod"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing\
    \ damage, it splits into two new puddings if it has at least 10 hit points. Each\
    \ new pudding has hit points equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down.\
    \ New puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding."

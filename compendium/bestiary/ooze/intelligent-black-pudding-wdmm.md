- "desc": "A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while\
    \ within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made\
    \ of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon\
    \ takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty\
    \ drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or\
    \ wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can\

    \ −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces\

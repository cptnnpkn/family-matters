Slipping through the darkest corners of the world, daemogoths are powerful fiendish creatures that feed on misery and other negative emotions. Some sages refer to daemogoths as tear lickers, owing to the fiends' tendency to lurk near battlefields and other sites of great tragedy to consume the anguish saturating the area.

Daemogoths are creatures of forbidden knowledge and magic, all fueled by their consumption of anguish. They trade magical influence over the lives and minds of others to ambitious mortals in exchange for the mortal's agony.

Daemogoths are alien-looking in the extreme. Their eyes are insectile or smooth and bulbous like gleaming jewels, and they have five arms. They typically wear long robes, which drape low over their forms, and they sport a halo of horns, antlers, or floating stones or crystals.

    \ effect that can remove a curse.\n\nThe daemogoth chooses one spell from the\
    \ necromancy or enchantment school that is 3rd level or lower. The bound creature\
    \ can cast that spell using this pact, requiring no material components and using\
    \ Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. When it casts the spell, the creature\
    \ takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage, which can't break the creature's [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\

- "desc": "The flame ignores the range restriction on its telepathy when communicating\
    \ with a creature it has [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed).\
    \ The two don't even need to be on the same plane of existence."
  "name": "Telepathic Bond"
- "desc": "The flame sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional\
    \ 20 feet. If it leaves the hall or is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed\
    \ and can't re-form for 24 hours."

"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6\
    \ + 3) fire damage."
  "name": "Claw"
- "desc": "One humanoid the flame can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC\
    \ 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ for 1 day. The [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target\
    \ obeys the flame's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm\
    \ or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect\
    \ on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the\
    \ effect on it ends, the target is immune to this flame's Charm for the next 24\
    \ hours.\n\nThe flame can have only one target [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends."
  "name": "Charm"
- "desc": "The flame kisses a creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving\
    \ throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum\
    \ is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until\
    \ the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its\
    \ hit point maximum to 0."

# [Cold Snap Spirit](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\elemental/cold-snap-spirit-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 234*  

A number of "elves" and archmagi still live who remember the "Icelost Years"â€”a dark time in Tal'Dorei's history, when legions of ice-rimed warriors spilled forth from the Elemental Planes, intent on turning the world into a gelid wasteland. Cold snap spirits are a surviving echo of the vast armies of the cruel elemental "Errevon the Rimelord", who nearly claimed Tal'Dorei for his own. They linger in the ever-frozen forests of the "Frostweald", atop the snow-capped peaks of the "Cliffkeep Mountains", and amid the arctic plains of the "Neverfields".

## Reclusive Spirits

When separated from the malign command of an elemental warlord, cold snap spirits are little more than animalistic creatures of instinct. They drift harmlessly about cold regions of the Material Plane that mirror the interminable frost of their plane of origin.

## Heated Hatred

Normally docile cold snap spirits are driven into a terrible frenzy by the presence of heat. They have an instinctive fear of flame, and even the warmth of a living creature can be enough to drive them into a murderous rage. Once the source of heat is annihilated, a cold snap spirit rapidly returns to a state of calm ambivalence.

## Inchoate Berserkers

Cold snap spirits make excellent soldiers for elemental beings with ambition and the will to dominate. Their aversion to warm climes is quickly overridden by loyalty to their commander, and the ambient heat of even a temperate region is enough to drive them to a state of constant frenzy.

# [Cinderslag Elemental](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\elemental/cinderslag-elemental-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 231*  

Cinderslag elementals are pure manifestations of the hatred and furore of the deceased "Cinder King, Thordak". Even after his death, the fires of that great red dragon continue to ravage "Emon", as places scorched by his corrupting flames are transformed into vitriolic pits of slag and ash that spawn mindless creatures of elemental destruction. Though "Thordak's Crater" in "Emon" has mostly been healed by the Fire Ashari of Pyrah, the terrible fires still churning beneath the city give rise to [cinderslag elementals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cinderslag-elemental-tdcsr.md), as do other areas where the "Cinder King's" elemental devastation has left an indelible mark, including the ruins of "Serpent's Head" in the "Cliffkeep Mountains" and the "Ashen Gorge" in the "Stormcrest Mountains".

## Gaze of Annihilation

A cinderslag elemental's Molten Gaze unleashes incredible power that can melt steel and stone with a glance. If one of these creatures is allowed to focus its gaze for long periods, or if several elementals work in unison, entire cities can easily be leveled in a tide of molten stone. Fortunately for the people of "Emon", "Thordak's" elemental spawn are mindless and incapable of unified action—as long as no one is able to bend these creatures to their will.

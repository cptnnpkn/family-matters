# [Fume Drake](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\elemental/fume-drake-dosi.md)
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle p. 41*  

Fume drakes are mischievous creatures that arise from the lingering magical energy of a dead dragon. They resemble small, legless dragons formed from clouds of greenish smoke. They delight in causing pain and confusion in other creatures.

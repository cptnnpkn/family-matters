To ensure that they don't starve in the winter, the Reghed nomads of Icewind Dale follow the migration routes of reindeer herds and are mindful not to deplete the herds to the point where the beasts can no longer flourish or defend themselves against other natural predators.

The average adult reindeer is 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 250 pounds. Both male and female reindeer have antlers, though a male's antlers are larger.

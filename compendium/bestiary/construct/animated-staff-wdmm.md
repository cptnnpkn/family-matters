- "desc": "A creature can grab the staff out of the air with a successful grapple\
    \ check against the staff, and grappling the staff does not reduce the creature's\
    \ speed. Any creature that successfully grapples the staff must succeed on a DC\
    \ 12 Charisma saving throw or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by the staff until the staff is no longer in its grasp. While the creature is\
    \ [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), the staff can issue\
    \ commands to it, which the creature does its best to obey. The creature can repeat\
    \ the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a\
    \ success. A creature that successfully resists the staff's control can't be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by it for 24 hours.\n\nA creature holding the staff that isn't [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ by it can use an action to attempt to break the staff over a knee or against\
    \ a solid surface, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
    \ check. Breaking the staff in this manner destroys it."

- "desc": "The staff has 10 charges. It can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast\
    \ one of the following spells (save DC 12): [cone of cold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold.md)\
    \ (5 charges), [fog cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md) (1 charge), [ice\
    \ storm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ice-storm.md) (4 charges), or [wall of ice](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-ice.md)\
    \ (4 charges). It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the staff\
    \ expends its last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and\
    \ is destroyed."

# [Mad Golem](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/mad-golem-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 254*  

Stone golems are magical constructs cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Like other golems, they are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons.

The jumbled construct was once a 10-foot-tall stone golem created in the image of Halaster. In its madness, it has attached so many pieces of other Stonecloaks to itself that it has become a lumbering, 17-foot-tall amalgamation of stone torsos, limbs, and headsâ€”all of which resemble parts of the Mad Mage.

# [Spiked Tomb Guardian](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/spiked-tomb-guardian-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 154*  

Adventurers who have perished inside the tomb are stitched together by tomb dwarves and bolted into suits of armor. Once complete, these shambling golems are released into the tomb to hunt intruders.

A tomb guardian is a flesh golem clad in plate armor, giving it AC 17

    \ berserk, the tomb guardian attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature\
    \ is near enough to move to and attack, the tomb guardian attacks an object, with\
    \ preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the tomb guardian goes berserk,\
    \ it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. The\
    \ golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk tomb guardian, can try to\
    \ calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The tomb guardian must be able\
    \ to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion))\
    \ check. If the check succeeds, the tomb guardian ceases being berserk. If it\
    \ takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the tomb guardian might\
    \ go berserk again."

# [Galvan Magen](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/galvan-magen-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 301*  

Galvan magen can fly. They also store static electricity, which they discharge as lightning bolts.

Magen are magical, humanlike beings created by a wizard spell (see the [create magen](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-magen-idrotf.md) spell in appendix D) or by other arcane methods.

Though magen look like humanoids with green skin, they are constructs. When one is wounded, its blood is seen to have the color and consistency of mercury. They exist purely through magical means. When one is killed, its body disappears in a burst of harmless fire and a cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates.

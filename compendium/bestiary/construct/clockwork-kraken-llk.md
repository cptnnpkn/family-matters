- "desc": "The clockwork kraken has eight tentacles, each of which is treated as a\
    \ Medium creature, moves independently on the construct's turn, and has a flying\
    \ speed of 40 feet. The clockwork kraken's senses operate through its tentacles\
    \ as well as its main body. Each tentacle can be attacked independently, with\
    \ damage dealt to tentacles applied to the clockwork kraken's hit point total.\
    \ A tentacle is destroyed if it takes more than 20 damage.\n\nReducing the construct\
    \ to three or fewer tentacles reduces its attacks accordingly. A clockwork kraken\
    \ can regrow any destroyed tentacles at the end of a long rest."

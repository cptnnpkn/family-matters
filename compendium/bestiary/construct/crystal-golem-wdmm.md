# [Crystal Golem](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 210*  

Crystal golems found throughout the Crystal Labyrinth look like 10-foot-tall githyanki warriors. Like other golems, they are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons.

# [Stonecloak](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/stonecloak-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 253*  

Stone golems are magical constructs cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Like other golems, they are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons.

Halaster created stone golems in his own likeness and used fragments of the Runestone to imbue them with intelligence. Then he set them loose on this level. Called Stonecloaks, these 10-foot-tall golems worship the Mad Mage as a god and regard the Runestone as his eye into their dark domain.

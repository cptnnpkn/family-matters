# [Fractal Mascot](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/fractal-mascot-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 192*  

To an untrained eye, a fractal mascot looks like a creature made from facets of hard light. But arithmancers know that these fractals are actually living equations: artificial life forms created by extrapolating magic from the mathematical patterns in nature.

Because of their arithmetic basis, fractal mascots can alter both their size and density. Quandrix College has adopted the fractal as its mascot, and many a Quandrix student can be found playing fetch with a fractal companion in between lessons.

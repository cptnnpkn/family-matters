# [Alyxian the Hunter](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/alyxian-the-hunter-crcotn.md)
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 160*  

This ruidium golem resembles Alyxian the Apotheon. It remains as rigid as a statue until the characters attack it or until Theo vanishes from the Netherdeep.

    \ or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A\

    \ effect on itself on a success."

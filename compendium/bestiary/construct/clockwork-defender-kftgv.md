# [Clockwork Defender](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/clockwork-defender-kftgv.md)
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 85*  

A clockwork defender is a mechanical quadruped that vaguely resembles a hound. Its eyes glow and can project intense but harmless beams of light. It tirelessly protects whatever its creator wants, and it can be programmed by its creator not to attack certain kinds of creatures.

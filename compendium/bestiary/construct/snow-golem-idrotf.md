# [Snow Golem](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/snow-golem-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 308*  

A snow golem is a mass of snow brought to life through magic. Nonmagical weapons pass through its snowy form without dealing any appreciable damage to it, though heat is its doom.

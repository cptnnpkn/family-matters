# [Living Blade of Disaster](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/living-blade-of-disaster-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 299*  

A living blade of disaster is a [blade of disaster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blade-of-disaster-tce.md) spell (see appendix D) with a wicked will of its own. It looks like a floating, black planar rift in the shape of a sword. Like a demon, it craves destruction.

Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that become living beings. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.

# [Animated Chained Library](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/animated-chained-library-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 24*  

The three shelves are filled with books bound in iron covers, which are attached to chains that secure them to the shelvesâ€”a chained library. The reading desk is used to support the chained books while they are being read.

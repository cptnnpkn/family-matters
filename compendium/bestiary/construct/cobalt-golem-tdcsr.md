# [Cobalt Golem](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/cobalt-golem-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 240*  

Ageless and unstoppable guardians, golems are expertly crafted to execute their owners' every command without question. Vaguely humanoid in appearance and unfailingly loyal, these powerful constructs feel no agony or sympathy, require no sustenance or sleep, ignore bribes and bargains, and do as they are told without remorse or hesitation.

## Covetous Origins

During the "Age of Arcanum", magic inspired a deep arrogance in many of the gods' children, who assumed arcane gifts were proof of inevitable divinity. In response, many mortal folk experimented with manufacturing "life" of their own. The "dwarves" succeeded first, marrying divine gifts with technical skill to animate autonomous wardens as protectors of their ancestral halls. The "dwarves'" knowledge was quickly stolen and expanded upon by other folk, and creating golems eventually became less about proving that mortals can shape life as the gods do, and more about protecting life, wealth, and secrets from others.

## Cobalt Golem

A unique form of a classic arcane construct, cobalt golems are mighty armored servitors made by arcanists who find iron too mundane a metal. The first seeds of these automata fall from the sky, with raw cobalt carefully extracted from meteorites and smelted by way of ferromagnetic alchemy into a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal. This finished cobalt is then molded and twisted into armored skin shielding clockwork designs that animate rune-encrusted muscle-like chains. A central lodestone powers a cobalt golem, fueled by magic rituals that spark ionized life within its inorganic shell.

### Archivists' Automata

The "Library of the Cobalt Soul" has commissioned a large number of cobalt golems to guard their most restricted archives, taking pleasure in the serendipitous nature of the construct's name and trusting the threat of these powerful warriors to deter anyone thinking of fleeing with sacred knowledge.

# [Living Unseen Servant](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/living-unseen-servant-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 313*  

## Living Spell

Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that refuse to dissipate. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.

A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy lingers and moves with purpose.

### Constructed Nature

A living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Magical Essence

The process that creates a living spell changes the nature of its magic. A living spell isn't subject to [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) and isn't affected by an [antimagic field](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field.md).

Like an overzealous butler or maid, a living [unseen servant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/unseen-servant.md) spell busies itself with tasks in hopes of pleasing its creator. It can wield simple weapons but prefers not to. [See invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md), [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md), and similar effects reveal that the servant has a shape similar to that of a slender humanoid adult.

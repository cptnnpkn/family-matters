# [Wraithroot Tree](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\plant/wraithroot-tree-tdcsr.md)
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 259*  

When ancient or nefarious entities need to safeguard objects of grave consequence—particularly items intertwined with their immortality—they bury those secrets alongside wraithroot trees, around which the people of Exandria dare not tread.

## Vengeful Restoration

Wraithroot trees are the product of foul necromancy and transmutation rituals that first see a tree awakened, gifting it with advanced intelligence and imbuing its roots with mobility. But the [awakened tree's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) first moments of joyous awareness are tragically cut short as necromantic energy courses through it, channeling rage and evil to transform it into a wraithroot—filled with longing to obliterate the life it so fleetingly enjoyed.

## Wraithroot Sites

In Tal'Dorei, wraithroots can be found in a number of locations, including the "Parchwood Timberlands" below "Whitestone", the "Torian Forest" along the southwestern edge of the "Cliffkeep Mountains", the "Grey Valley" north of "Kraghammer", and the Moldered Grove southeast of the Ashkeeper Peaks.

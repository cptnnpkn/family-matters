- "desc": "Whenever the chamberlain takes damage, it releases a cloud of spores. Creatures\
    \ within 5 feet of the chamberlain when this happens must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution\
    \ saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\
    \ for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\

  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The chamberlain releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a\
    \ 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any\
    \ flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later,\
    \ must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature\
    \ can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature\
    \ is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random\
    \ form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy\
    \ table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or\
    \ dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must\
    \ be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection\
    \ on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over\
    \ by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is\
    \ reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the\
    \ \"Myconids\" entry in the Monster Manual)."

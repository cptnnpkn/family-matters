# [Mantrap](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\plant/mantrap-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 227*  

A mantrap is a giant carnivorous plant that resembles an oversized flytrap. To attract prey, the mantrap releases a pollen that magically draws creatures to it. Though it will snap its leafy jaws shut around any warm-blooded creature that strays within its reach, it prefers humanoid prey.

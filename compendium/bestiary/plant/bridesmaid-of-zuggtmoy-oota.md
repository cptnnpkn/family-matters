"traits":
- "desc": "Once on its turn, the bridesmaid can use 10 feet of its movement to step\
    \ magically into one living mushroom or fungus patch within 5 feet and emerge\
    \ from another within 60 feet of the first one, appearing in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 5 feet of the second mushroom or fungus patch. The mushrooms and patches\
    \ must be large or bigger."
  "name": "Fungus Stride"
"actions":
- "desc": "The bridesmaid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of\
    \ it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\
    \ for 1 minute. While [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)\
    \ in this way, the target is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).\
    \ The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success."
  "name": "Hallucination Spores"
- "desc": "The bridesmaid releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius\
    \ sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood\
    \ creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a\
    \ DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be\
    \ infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected\
    \ with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of\
    \ indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in\
    \ appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While\
    \ infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat\
    \ the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success.\
    \ On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth,\
    \ and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a\
    \ spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry\
    \ in the Monster Manual)."

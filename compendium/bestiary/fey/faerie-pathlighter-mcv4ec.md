# [Faerie Pathlighter](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fey/faerie-pathlighter-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Faerie pathlighters pry into human lives, sometimes to help (like a classic fairy godparent) and sometimes to harm. In the wilds of Eldraine, faerie pathlighters often serve as protectors for the lost, the glow of their guiding lanterns leading weary travelers to respite.

A faerie pathlighter has an almost angelic appearance. Their large, white wings become more translucent toward the edges. Motes of magical light drift around their heads, and a faint white aura surrounds their bodies.

## Faeries

The faeries of Eldraine are winged, elfin creatures similar to sprites or pixies. Unpredictable, unreliable, and amoral, they lurk in the wilds and harass travelers they perceive as intruders.

> [!note] Ouphes
> 
> Ouphes are curious creatures found throughout the wilds of Eldraine. While often seen as foolish, ouphes are magically connected to the natural world and know more about the secret lives of trees, mushrooms, and moss than most mortals. While ouphes are related to Eldraine's faeries, the faeries treat them like distant (and somewhat embarrassing) cousins. Ouphes can be represented with the stat blocks for pixies or sprites.
